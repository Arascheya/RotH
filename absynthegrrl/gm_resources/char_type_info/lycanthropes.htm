<p class="pagecaption">Lycanthropes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">genetically based as a recessive gene. transmitted in rare cases by
an HIV type viral infection. delay of onset 1 to 5 years with infection determined as CON roll.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">tracks red moon for change effects. each type is susceptible to only a particular type of metal, list to follow</p>

<p class="regtxt9">wolves/canines - silver</p>
<p class="regtxt9">felines - mythryl</p>
<p class="regtxt9">avians - gold</p>
<p class="regtxt9">bears - copper</p>
<p class="regtxt9">boars - adamantite</p>

<p class="regtxt5">all types take damage from majikal attacks. all types take half
damage from energy weapons with twice the chance for stun from the incredible pain of the injury. All other types of damage produce only the pain from the attack (stun effects are possible from pain)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">each type takes damage from a particular type of metal. this metal
causes damage in either form. it is the only other type of weapon that will damage the lycanthrop in either form. damage may be healed majikally but requires twice the effort, i.e. a laying on of hands would require two rounds of concentration per point healed instead of one round per point. potions/herbs that restore a die roll type of concussion points would have the rolled number halved.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">all types resist disease at twice the rate of their original race.</p>
