<p class="pagecaption">Face Dancers</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Face Dancing is the art and ability to mimic others near the user of the ability. Common knowledge claims Face Dancers are some odd race that entered the world through the World Gates before they were closed. The truth is they are regular beings that have been modified by magic spells cast be the Rune Priest(ess) of their order as part of initiation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Face Dancers begin with very basic abilities to model simple things in the appearance of their target. These abilities increase and become more powerful as the Face Dancer rises in skill. At the highest levels the Face Dancer may replicate and emulate their target to a point where all but the most intimate of friends will believe the impersonation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All levels of impersonation require careful study of that particular aspect of the target. The more completely the Face Dancer attempts to mimic the target the longer and more detailed the study must be. For example to model a face only requires the Face Dancer to study the appearance of the target from a close distance, at a tavern for example. To mimic voice and actions requires long and careful study of the target, often in close proximity and for long enough to observe the details and nuances to the desired depth. Fooling a family member is far more complex than fooling a casual acquaintance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Minimum requirements: int=12, wis=12, dex=16, con=16. If the candidate does not meet the required CON guidelines the Priest(ess) may adjust this through additional spell casting. This is an expensive request, usually requiring the sacrifice of all but one point of power by the candidate and the cost of a 50% tithe for one year to the temple.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The minds of these beings are equally male/female, they are truly ‘gender neutral’, thus they have no trouble acting as either. A face dancer as a general rule also has a second profession to give themselves some offensive/defensive capabilities. Face dancers, up to level 14, look like normal humans and are subject to the limits of that race. Face dancers prefer to avoid spell oriented professions as it is harder to maintain concentration on appearance and spells at the same time. This also applies to concentration oriented artifacts. Concentration on two different things increases the possibility of someone noticing discrepancies in the face dancer’s altered appearance. This adjustment is 5% greater chance unless the face dancer is mimicking someone well known to the observer, then the adjustment is +15%. It is not possible to reduce the % detection lower than 2% regardless of level.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a Face Dancer to progress to the next level they must have the current level skill(s) at 75% or better. Each skill must be trained at least once. Training may be used to 45% proficiency, after that only actual use "in the field" will allow increases. As each new skill is achieved previous skills may be used in conjunction with it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are legends of Face Dancers that are so evolved and skilled that they can mimic any living being of any species, however no one has ever actually knowingly encountered one. No Priest(ess) or temple will acknowledge this possibility either.</p>
