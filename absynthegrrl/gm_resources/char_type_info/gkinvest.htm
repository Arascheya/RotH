<p class="pagecaption">Ghostkiss Investigator</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The dead hunger. They lust. They dream of holding their children one ?nal time, of eating a favorite meal, of making love just once more
before walking Beyond. Most are pitiable. Most are disturbing. A few are dangerous. A few ghosts possess the living, committing atrocities, seeking vengeance, stealing what is no longer theirs by right. Murder, rape, torture, genocide. All these things can create a ghost; all these are crimes occasionally committed by
ghosts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ghostkiss Investigators mediate between the worlds of the living and the dead. They allow the dead to say their final goodbyes, often offering
their own bodies as vessels for intimate moments with lost loves. They solve crimes of both the human and ghostly worlds. They bring closure to the dead and peace to the living. And they bring an abrupt end to vengeful ghosts too powerful and enraged to go gently into the good night.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Profile of a Ghostkiss Investigator</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am awake in the place where women die." -  Jenny Holzer, 1996</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ghostkiss Investigators blend ancient Shinto and Buddhist exorcism techniques with cutting edge Western post-life research. Their diverse skills embrace quantum physics and parapsychology, forensics and the Roman Rites of Exorcism. Ghostkiss Investigators are more than just spiritual dilettantes:
they are born with a strange natural gift. These death-shrouded children can see and touch the invisible dead, all around us. They can walk in the worlds
beyond, and fight menaces in both worlds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Many are a strange kind of necrophiliac, drawn to the dead out of both pity and lust. Others are purely compassionate beings, who are compelled to help the dead find peace, haunted by the losses in their own past. All are as comfortable around the dead as the living. All are quietly, almost unnoticeably broken on some soul-deep level that modern psychiatry can never touch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The fastest path into the Ghostkiss Investigator advanced class is through the Dedicated Hero basic class, though other paths are possible.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Ghostkiss Investigator in the Campaign</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While many of the warriors and spiritualists of Black Tokyo focus on fighting back an endless tide of invading demons, the Ghostkiss Investigator fights an older and more intimate enemy. The Investigator fights creatures that were once human, but are no less deadly for their lost humanity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ghostkiss Investigators are well trained, disciplined and focused, all traits that serve them well in Department Seven. They are the ultimate forensics experts, called to the scene when undead or necromantic magic threatens innocents. Their usefulness overrides their necrophiliac strangeness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In campaigns where Soul Collectors are allowed, they work closely with Ghostkiss Investigators. The two very similar classes offer different approaches to the same problem: what role should the souls of the dead play in the lives of the living. The two classes may work closely together, both necromantic professionals with respect for the others’ views and abilities, or they can be bitter rivals.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Requirements:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To qualify to become a Ghostkiss Investigator , a character must fulfill the following criteria.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Skills:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Investigate 8 ranks, Knowledge: arcane lore 6 ranks, earth & life sciences 4 ranks, theology & philosophy 8 ranks, Diplomacy 2 ranks</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Feats:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Attentive, Iron Will</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Gender:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Members of either gender may become Ghostkiss Investigators.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Special:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Prior to becoming a true Ghostkiss Investigator, a candidate must have engaged in friendly, if not openly sexual contact with a ghost or other undead creature. Most Ghostkiss Investigators are initiated into the mysteries of their class by a ghostly lover. However, many report odd supernatural incidents, brushes with the dead and strange coincidences for years before ever taking a level in this class.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Class Information</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The following information pertains to the Ghostkiss
Investigator advanced class.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Hit Die</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The Ghostkiss Investigator gains d6 hit points per level. The character’s Constitution modifier applies. Ghostkiss Investigators are strong in will and magic, but are physically as frail and mortal as the decaying remains they work.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Action Points</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The Ghostkiss Investigator gains a number of action points equal to 6 + one-half of his character level, rounded down every time he attains a new level in this class.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Class Skills</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The Ghostkiss Investigator’s class skills are as follows.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Decipher Script (INT), Diplomacy (CHA), Gather Information (CHA), Handle Animal (CHA), Hide (DEX), Intimidate (CHA), Investigate (INT), Knowledge (arcane lore, art, earth & life sciences, history, theology & philosophy) (INT), Listen (WIS), Move Silently (DEX), Profession (any religious, mortician, investigatory) (WIS), Read/Write Language, Research (INT), Search (WIS), Sense Motive (WIS), Speak Language, Treat Injury (WIS)</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + INT Modifier</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Bonus Feat:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">At level, the Ghostkiss Investigator may choose a bonus feat, which must be chosen from the following list.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Detailed in Black Tokyo</p>

<p class="regtxt18"><a href="../info/rulebase/gun_fetish.htm">Gunslinger’s Fetish</a>, <a href="../info/rulebase/unchange_hand.htm">Unchanging Hand Technique</a>, <a href="../info/rulebase/ward_filth.htm">Wards of Filth</a></p>

<p class="regtxt15">Detailed in another product written by the author</p>

<p class="regtxt18">Akashatic Memories, Benevolent Haunting, Burning Belief, Carrion Scavenger, Child of the Gallows, Dead Heart, Dead Flesh, Dying Insight, Ghostly Familiar, Gifts of Ecstasy, Helpful Poltergeist, Life Eater, Lingering Purity, Memento Mori, Skillful Executioner</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Not Detailed</p>

<p class="regtxt18">Acrobatic, Alertness, Animal Affinity, Archaic Weapon Proficiency, Combat Martial Arts, Combat Expertise, Confident, Defensive Martial Arts, Endurance, Focused, Frightful Presence, Great Fortitude, Heroic Surge, Improved Initiative, Improved Combat Martial Arts, Iron Will, Medical Expert, Stealthy, Studious, Surgery, Track, Trustworthy, Windfall</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Altar of the Body (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The dead lust. For flesh, for the sensation of warm blood moving through their veins, for the passion and pulse of life they no longer experience. By offering a dead soul a last chance at human passion and ecstasy, the Ghostkiss Investigator can help it find peace, and end a potentially fatal conflict.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">If a Ghostkiss Investigator can change an undead’s attitude to at least friendly, he or she may willingly offer her body to the ghost or undead in exchange for its final banishment from the mortal plane. It doesn’t matter the undead creature’s gender or sexual orientation in life - it is intimacy, closeness and affection the spirit craves, not just sexual rut.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Once offered this sexual rite of exorcism, the undead may attempt a WILL save (using a WIS score of 10 or the undead’s WIS score in life, whichever is less for mindless undead; or the undead’s actual WIS score in the case of sentient undead). The Saving Throw DC is 8 plus the Ghostkiss Investigator’s class level plus her CHA modifier. If the Investigator has the Gifts of Ecstasy feat, the saving throw DC is increased by +4. Once the ritual is refused, that undead can never be the target of this ability again by that particular Investigator.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The sexual encounter lasts at least an hour, and may stretch as long as several hours. Depending on the creature, it might involve a necrophiliac encounter with a skeleton, decaying zombie or other corporeal undead. The Ghostkiss Investigator can always sexually interact with otherwise incorporeal undead, enjoying them as if they were a living partner. If the undead is attacked or harmed during the sexual rite, the effect is broken, and the creature can never again be seduced by that Ghostkiss Investigator.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Once complete, the undead is destroyed forever. An undead creature exorcised in this manner cannot be raised or resurrected while the
Ghostkiss Investigator who exorcised it lives. Though disturbing, the encounter is almost always pleasurable for the Ghostkiss Investigator, though
she is exhausted after performing this draining, demanding ritual.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Death Without Fear or Pain (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Ghostkiss Investigator’s hair, including her pubic hair becomes as white as snow, and her skin becomes cool to the touch. She has been intimately exposed to the horrors of the dead and has confronted her mortality. Beginning at 5th level, the Ghostkiss Investigator becomes immune to all mundane and magical fear effects, and cannot become shaken, cowering, or panicked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Die in Pleasure (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">the most highly skilled Ghostkiss Investigators can snuff out the spark of life, allowing the dying to pass gently and pleasurably into
the beyond. As a standard action, a 10th level Ghostkiss Investigator can snuff out the life of anyone who is at 0 HP or fewer. She can use this ability to affect any dying creature within 30 ft.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">If the Ghostkiss Investigator uses this ability from a distance, the dying creature receives a WILL save (DC 20 + the Investigator’s CHA modi?er). However, if the Investigator spends at least a full round action in intimate physical contact with the dying creature, it receives no save against this
effect. This effect can slay even creatures normally immune to death effects. A creature slain by this class ability cannot be raised or resurrected as long as the Investigator who ended its life remains living.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Ghostkiss Investigator instantly recovers 1d4 HP per point of the dying creature’s CHA modifier. Excess HP become temporary hit points, which last until used or until the Investigator next sleeps.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">If the Investigator is touching any undead creature when she uses this class ability, instead of choosing to benefit from the healing effect herself, she can use the dying creature’s soul matter in one of two ways. She can either charge her body with positive energy, inflicting a number of points of damage upon the undead creature equal to the recovered HP.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Alternatively, the Ghostkiss Investigator can imbue her body with negative energy, allowing her undead servitor to benefit from the ‘healing effect’. Any excess HP regained by the undead are simply lost.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Action Enhancement:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">By spending an action point when she activates this class ability, the Ghostkiss Investigator can affect all dying creatures within a 30 ft radius, and receive a magical healing effect from all their demises. The Ghostkiss Investigator can physically touch up to two dying creatures who are no more than 5 ft apart, and can affect other dying creatures remotely. </p>

<p class="regtxt5">Diplomacy of Gentle Death (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Ghostkiss Investigator is a mediator between the worlds of the living and those of the dead. Restless souls, even the angriest, most hostile spirits are drawn to her compassion and gentle nature, and will often break of an assault to parley with the one human who can help them find peace.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Ghostkiss Investigator may add her WIS modifier as a bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy and Gather Information checks she makes against sentient undead. She is an effective diplomat among the lifeless.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In addition, the Ghostkiss Investigator receives a daily pool of bonus points one plus her WIS modifier (minimum two points). A bonus point may be spent to allow the Investigator to interact with the undead in new ways. All effects last for a number of minutes equal to the Ghostkiss Investigator’s class level. By spending a bonus point, the Ghostkiss Investigator can perform any of the following feats:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Become invisible to mindless undead. Mindless undead will not harm or interact with the Investigator, unless she attacks them. The creature can then act normally.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Gain the ability to communicate with mindless undead, by calling a shard of that creature’s soul back to inhabit its body. The Investigator
can communicate and use CHA-based skills on mindless undead, as if the creatures had INT, WIS and CHA scores equal to 10 or the scores they had in life, which ever is less.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Render a single mindless undead creature vulnerable to mind-in?uencing effects. The creature must be within 30 ft of the Investigator. This ability renders the undead vulnerable to all mind influencing effects, not just those of the Investigator. The creature is treated as if it has INT, WIS and CHA scores equal to 10 or the scores they had in life, which ever is less.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Improve the result of a turning check. As part of the action of the turning attempt, the Ghostkiss Investigator can spend a bonus point to receive a +1d6 bonus on the turning check, enabling her to confront more dangerous undead.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Automatically adjust a sentient undead’s attitude. As a free action, the Ghostkiss Investigator can attempt to use her force of personality and strange connection to the dead to improve her relationship with any sentient undead creature. The undead receives a WILL save (DC 8 + the Investigator’s class level + her WIS modifier) to resist the effect. If the save is failed, the creature’s attitude towards the Ghostkiss Investigator alone improves by
one category.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">This is normally a temporary change, but if negotiations go well, even a hostile ghost or hungry vampire might come to regard the Investigator as a trusted friend. This effect ends abruptly if the Ghostkiss Investigator attacks the undead after using this ability. A single undead may be affected by this ability only once per encounter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ghostsight (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Ghostkiss Investigator has caught ?eeting glimpses of the ghostly world beyond ours since they were children. They can see the spirits of the dead all around us. The Investigators aid these minor, mournful ghosts in small ways, and in return are aided by the lesser spirits of the dead.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ghostkiss Investigators can naturally see invisible creatures and objects, as well as see creatures moving through the Astral and Ethereal plane near them. When in any cemetery or murder sight, the Ghostkiss Investigator’s eyes become even keener, granting them lowlight vision.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A number of times per day equal to her Ghostkiss Investigator class level, the Investigator can call upon some minor spirit, too weakly connected to the mortal plane for other ghost hunters to perceive or effect, for aid. These minor spirits cannot be turned or affected by most creatures, though other Ghostkiss Investigators can perceive these peaceful dead souls.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">These weak ghosts have forgotten most of the details of their mortal life, which might have passed centuries ago, but still aid their ‘living brother or sister’ to the best of their ability and show traces of their long dead personality and interests.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The ghostly intercession takes the form of a +1d4 morale bonus on the Ghostkiss Investigator’s next skill check, attack roll or saving throw. Requesting ghostly aid is a considered part of the action involved in performing the check.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Within a few minutes after  the task is complete, the Ghostkiss Investigator is expected to make a gesture of thanks to the spirit world: a brief prayer, a sacrifice of rice or incense, or any other minor respectful gesture. If the Ghostkiss Investigator fails to thank her helpful spirit guides, she angers the ghosts, and cannot call upon this class feature until she next sleeps.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Necrofeeder (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Ghostkiss Investigator’s body changes, becoming even more like the dead she loves so much. Beginning at 8th level, the Ghostkiss Investigator becomes immune to ability and energy drain.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Any undead attempting to use one of these attack forms on the Investigator must succeed at a saving throw (identical to the one its victim would normally have to make) or suffer the effects of the energy drain itself as the necromantic energy of the attack rebounds on the creature.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Regardless of her ethos, the Ghostkiss Investigator is healed by negative energy (such as from Inflict Wounds spells). She can still heal normally, as well as benefit from positive energy based Cure Wounds spells.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rite of Exorcism (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">All Ghostkiss Investigators are powerful exorcists and necromancers, marked forever by their soul deep connection to the dead. Starting at 2nd
 level, the Ghostkiss Investigator can turn undead as if she were an acolyte of equivalent level.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Regardless of the Ghostkiss Investigator’s ethos she may both turn, rebuke command and bolster undead. The Ghostkiss Investigator does not need to brandish a holy symbol, simply reciting a prayer or appealing to the dead soul on a personal level is enough.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Vulgar Animation (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Just as she can banish unquiet spirits by tempting them with sexual favors, the Ghostkiss Investigator can call weak-willed ghosts to inhabit corporeal shells as her servants and playthings.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">By engaging in a prolonged necrophiliac ritual, which requires at least an hour, the Ghostkiss Investigator can animate a zombie or skeleton from any corpse she makes love to. This is effectively similar to an animate dead spell cast as an acolyte of the Investigator’s total character level, however only one creature can be animated at once. No material component, other than the Ghostkiss Investigator’s willing body, is necessary. Once the ritual is complete, the Ghostkiss Investigator is fatigued.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">While creating her undead servitor, the Investigator can spend her daily bonus points from her Diplomacy of Gentle Death to improve her undead spawn. These enhancements are permanent, and a specific undead can bene?t from any number of them, provided they are selected at the creature’s time of creation. She may enhance the undead’s ability in any of the following ways:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">A zombie created in this manner can move and attack normally, making it faster and more agile than most of its kind.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Undead created retain some trace of their skills. The undead ‘remembers’ 1 rank in any skill it had 10 or more ranks in while alive, and can use that skill normally, subject to its new attributes.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">(Two Points) Undead created in this manner retain their base INT, WIS and CHA scores, but their allegiances change to their mistress. Undead servitors can willingly be commanded to destroy themselves or take suicidal action, as well as take actions that would have been aborhant to them in life.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">(Two Points) Undead created in this manner cannot be turned.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">(Three Points) The Undead retains the feats it had mastered in life, and may use them normally. However, the undead cannot activate any feat that requires an action point expenditure, nor any feat that requires concentration or intelligence, if it is mindless.</p>
