<p class="sectioncaption">Notes:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">1) create new ones by sharing their blood with the target after drinking from the target - conversion cannot occur without this. if death is not caused by drinking the victim down, then the victim will slowly turn into a full vampyr as natural cell aging/death occurs. full conversion occurs immediately if the victim dies before full cellular conversion is complete.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">2) They can be seen in mirrors and reflective surfaces.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">3) A vampyr can be immobilized by cutting off its head and keeping itseparated fromthe body by more than four feet.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">4) They suffer pain but no damage from non-magical metal weapons, including projectile weapons</p>
<p class="regtxt5">5) Holy water, church artifacts, other sacred items, and garlic have no effect</p>
<p class="regtxt5">6) They take normal damage from fire - regenerate unless head or heart are destroyed</p>
<p class="regtxt5">7) Lightning does double damage and stuns the vampyr for 40 - CON minutes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">8) Blasters and other energy weapons do full damage</p>
<p class="regtxt5">9) Poisons depend on the type of effect</p>
<p class="regtxt5">10) sunlight causes extreme pain to the eyes and skin because the eyes are more sensitive to light and the skin more sensitive to UV - sunlight will severely burn a vampyr after more than a half hour uninterrupted exposure - think extreme sunburn after coming from winter. After an hour the vampyr begins to experience severe burns on all exposed skin. Death can result depending on amount of skin exposed and exposure time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">11) Damage heals at two hit points per day. Vampyr can regenerate from any non-lethal damage including broken neck, smashed skull, broken back, and internal injuries. brain damage can increase chances of insanity and memory loss</p>
<p class="regtxt5">12) To kill a vampyr you must immobilize it by cutting off its head, then either leave it in direct sunlight until it is burnt to death or burning the body at temperatures greater than 500 degrees fehrenheit (260 degress celcius). Sun exposure time is dependent on amount of skin exposed to the light. Death results in total disintegration of the body and any non-majik items touching it. Majik items get a save against this effect.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">13) Vampires can damage werewolves. It is unknown if werewolves can damage vampires.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">14) stronger than mortals - see stats above</p>
<p class="regtxt5">15) faster than mortals - see stats above</p>
<p class="regtxt5">16) may be any sentient life-form, but must consume blood similar to their own - i.e. a silicon based life-form cannot use blood from a carbon based one</p>
<p class="regtxt5">17) can transform into mist</p>
<p class="regtxt5">18) can transform into one creature, usually defined from the first time it occurs. If the creature is smaller than the original form of the vampyr, it will be surrounded by a barely visible mist. If the animal form is larger than the original form, the mass that is extra will have a subtle, hazy vagueness. While in this form the vampyr will slowly bleed intelligence, until reaching the animal intellect after two days fully in this form. Return to normal will occur if the animal is dealt life-threatening damage.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">19) the personality of the original remains, however few can live as vampyr without serious emotional and mental damage</p>
<p class="regtxt5">20) blood is required for survival, however it does not have to be sentient blood.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">21) sentient blood is a treat, having far more vitality and sparkle than non-sentient blood. Drinking sentient blood during sex produces the ultimate vampyr orgasm. Having a vampyr drink from you can cause a more intense orgasm in the victim as well. The vampyr does not need to drink the target down to death for this effect, even small sips can be enough.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">22) Regular food can be consumed. It tastes as good as it did to the pre-vampyr however it gives little sustenance.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">23) Breathing is possible for effect, to talk, or to smoke - should a vampyr desire to, it could give mouth-to-mouth successfully - this would require remembering to breathe rhythmically. Breathing remains essential for those not yet fully converted. Breathing is not essential for vampyr "life" support once full conversion is finished. They can survive in toxic atmospheres, however vacuum will cause all pressure related problems to them as well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">24) Healing requires more food intake, just as it does in the living.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">25) Charm attack is resolved as (Vampyr (CHAR + PWR)) vs (Target (PWR + INT)) between vampyr and target.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">26) when a vampyr is killed it will turn to powder. The vampyrites will go dormant. Dormant vampyrites can be reactivated by contact with fresh blood, making a vampyr corpse dangerous in this way. Iskandera was infected by dormant vampyrites.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The craving for sentient blood, and lots of it, is quite intense, particularly in younger vampyr. It takes a great deal of will to not attack those around because of this draw. This is simulated in game terms as D100 roll less than or equal to (POW + INT + CON). This must be rolled once a day in normal conditions and again if the vampyr is injured.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../info/daywalker.htm">Legends of the Day Walker</a> - information on this is sought by Vampyr everywhere. The legends are based in the artifact <a href="../npcs/mereret.htm">Mereret</a> possesses.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Vampyr biology</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Vampyrism is caused by a nanotechnology, <a href="../items/vampyrites.htm">vampyrites</a>, produced by the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a>, a now long-dead race. The vampyrites were designed as a self-replicating, self-spreading probe mechanism for sampling data from other races. They are blood/fluid born and require blood transfer to infect the target. Vampyrites are self replicating and through their bonding with the target biological they confer a type of immortality. They will maintain life at the "death" of the target, be it slow aging death or rapid death.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Unfortunately the vampyrites so radically alter the target organism that reliable data gathering is not possible. Another side-effect is the desire to spread the probes - this results in complete alteration of the target species, negating the effectiveness of the probes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Further development was cut short by the accidental release of vampyrites into the general populace.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is one "cure" for vampyrites, however it was not found by <a href="../npcs/iskandera.htm">Iskandera</a> during her travels. There is a <a href="../items/reducers.htm">Reducer Nanite</a> strain available on the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a> <a href="../places/drkzyrkth.htm">world</a>. These nanites will consume the vampyrites and then become inert. This will successfully remove vampyrism from the host if the host is young enough that life support can continue un-aided by the vampyrites.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Vampyrites use the nutrients and materials in the blood of the host to auto-regen the cells of the host. In their natural state this regeneration is happening at a constant rate, regardless of cell conditions. This uses up the elements of the blood faster than the normal processes can regenerate it. Consuming fresh whole blood, preferably of the same species as the host, allows the vampyrites to continue their reconstruction. As a further incentive, the host receives an orgasmic charge when the vampyrites have sufficient food to continue.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The control necklace moderates this by targeting regeneration only on damaged or dying cells and tissues. This reduces the vampyrite burn rate and allows the regular food mechanisms to better keep up. This allows the vampyr to exist on a mixed diet of regular food and occasional blood ingestion.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A wandering Arcane, <a href="../npcs/iskandera.htm">Iskandera</a>, is the 0 Vector, having become infected by the vampyrites when visiting the homeworld.</p>
