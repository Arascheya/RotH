<p class="regtxt5">From <a href="../../../GamingResources/Game_ESDs/ShadowRun/BlackTokyo/Black Tokyo-Chastity and Depravity WHW.pdf">Black Tokyo Chastity and Depravity</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Medium Monstrous Humanoid</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Notes and Updates</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ishra is a chaotic neutral entity, thus, this description should be modified to eliminate the need to kill lovers. Spider Souled will be of any ethical persuasion and able to determine their own course of actions with those they for relationships with. They will continue to gravitate toward the dark, death related, professions and actions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spider Souled were used by Ishra as spies, enforcers, and emmissaries to other sentients throught the multi-verse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The mechanism of creation continues to function even though Ishra is imprisoned. Spider Souled are not automatically detected by or used by Aztol. The underlings of Ishra's domain can contact and assist them, but the Spider Souled must make the first contact. This ability to contact comes as one of the skills acquired when they become a Spider Souled.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Original Black Tokyo Description</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spiders kill with exacting ritual and unfailing politeness, inquiring of their prey about the comfort of their webs even as they devour them. Spiders carry the wisdom of ancient trickster gods and the patient, murderous confidence of Earth’s oldest and most successful hunters with them. In Black Tokyo, where abused and broken women can ‘swallow the spiders eggs’ and become a Death Womb Seductress, spiders are a race with primal ties the cold and sociopathic darkness of the Black Else.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Black Else offers its spiders to many humans, not just the enraged women who have chosen to become Death Womb Seductresses. Spider Souled humans accepted the spider into their mouth while still a child, not assuming the unholy mantle out of a desire for revenge or justice, but becoming one with the darkness because they enjoy killing. Spider Souled men and women are murderers and assassins, human-shaped monsters with an artist’s appreciation for death and for all the myriad and fascinating ways humans can die.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spider Souled creatures begin their lives as ordinary humans, but at some point before their tenth birthday, they awaken from a dream of spiders transformed. Few outward signs mark their transformation, but from that moment on, they are a creature of two worlds. As they grow, Spider Souled are drawn to professions where they can hunt, kill and stalk. They often gravitate towards crime or the military, but the less adventurous among them are drawn to callings where they can interact with their prey for hours, or days, before death.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spider Souled humans are a secret part of modern urban life, and can be found in every city around the globe. Some work as homicide detectives and pathologists, others serve in hospitals or hospices, secretly acting as a medical angel of death. Those that can often find themselves working in prisons or asylums, and an assignment to a prison’s death row is a plum beyond compare for these outer-worldly humanoids.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spider Souled humans resemble their mortal counterparts closely. A Spider Souled’s teeth are smaller and a bit sharper than normal, and their eyes are small and deep set, but nothing dramatically outside of human norms. The only major differences between the two races are the short, bristly black hairs which grow from a Spider Soul’s elbows and knees, and the subtle growth of spinnarettes at their wrists and around their genitals. Female Spider Souled are marked by a crimson hour glass shape, like a black widow’s distinctive mark, which can be found just inches above her vulva.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Size and Type:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">As Medium Monstrous Humanoids, Spider Souled have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size. A Spider Souled’s base landspeed is 30 ft, and the creatures also possess a 30 ft Climb speed. They receive +12 racial bonus on Climb checks, and may always take 10 or 20 on a Climb check, even when threatened.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">As a Monstrous Humanoid, Spider Souled are immune to any spell or effects which specifically targets humanoids, such as Charm Person. However, they are vulnerable to any effect which specifically targets spider-like Vermin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ability Score Modifiers:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">None. Spider Souled Humans are every bit as diverse as mortal humans.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Racial Skills:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Spider Souled receive a +12 racial bonus on Climb checks, and on any Hide or Move Silently check made while climbing. Spider Souled receive a +2 racial bonus on Sense Motive and Diplomacy checks made in areas of shadowy or worse illumination.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Enhanced Senses:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Spider Souled Humans receive lowlight vision and possess the scent special quality. Exceptional Spider Souled humans can use the Track feat to track prey by scent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spinnarettes (EX):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A number of times per day equal to one plus her CON modifier (minimum twice daily), the Spider Soul human can extrude highly adhesive hunting webs. The Spider Souled can cast Web as an extraordinary ability, as a mage of her total character level.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Normally, a Spider Soul only hunts with his or her wrist spinnarettes. If the Spider Souled can bring her genital spinnarettes into play, the webbing is much denser and harder to escape from. If the Spider Souled uses both wrist and genital spinnarettes, all saving throws DCs associated with the web
effect are increased by +2.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Toxic Kiss (EX):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A Spider Souled human naturally secretes a mild neurotoxin in their saliva and sexual fluids. Any creature kissing or engaging in a sexual act with a Spider Souled human risks succumbing to a contact poison, with a DC equal to 12 + the Spider Soul’s CON modifier.  Initial damage is 1d4 WIS; secondary damage is unconsciousness for 10-12 minutes. The Spider Souled often use this ability to incapacitate and bind their prey. Victims succumb to a pleasant, morphine like haze.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Racial Weaknesses:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Spider Souled believe it is unforgivably rude to kill a creature without a prolonged ‘courtship’ and they prefer getting to know their prey before committing murder. If the Spider Souled has not spent at least one hour studying or researching a target, or at least 15 minutes in conversation with that target, the Spider Soul suffers a -1 morale penalty on attack and damage rolls made against that creature.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Spider Souled creatures are compelled by the black ichors running through their veins to murder their lovers. If a Spider Souled begins a romance with any sentient humanoid, he or she must either end the relationship or murder the lover before 6 calendar months elapse. If the Spider Souled fails to do either, the demon-tainted creature suffers 1 point of permanent INT and CHA drain. This damage recurs each month until the relationship ends, one way or another.</p>
