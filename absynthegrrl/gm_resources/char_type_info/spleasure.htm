<p class="pagecaption">Sacred Pleasurer</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I’m hexed, I’m vexed, I’m in the Devil’s text. Some say I keep my self respect hidden in my cervix. Next!" -  Peaches, AA XXX</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once upon a time, the word whore wasn’t an insult; it was a calling. Sacred prostitutes served in the temples, healing the sick, comforting the mournful and reading the oracles, allowing seekers a glimpse of the divine as they moaned and writhed in orgasm. As the world changed, and new faiths supplanted the old, the exalted nature of the divine whore was forgotten. Priestesses became heretics became prostitutes became forgotten. Today, despite the weight of years and tradition, a blessed handful of iconoclasts have rediscovered the rites and traditions of the divine prostitute.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Sacred Pleasures were once drawn from the ranks of the ancient world’s elite; it’s most beautiful and perceptive noble daughters. As the ages have passed, this primal and pleasurable connection to the divine has been democratized. Any good soul, who wishes to serve the divine, embody the Goddess and serve humanity may do so.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Proile of a Sacred Pleasurer</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To the Sacred Pleasurer, the godhead is within all humans, and a reminder of the divine essence can be coaxed from mortal flesh through sexual
communion. Sexuality is ritual; sexuality is love. Sexuality is meditation and worship service. Sacred Pleasures may hail from heretical Christian sects, from ancient lineages of Shinto priestesses with a long history of demonological expertise, or may arise when an untutored soul sees the face of God in the first orgasm she shares with another.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">No matter their origins or philosophy, Sacred Pleasures are vessels for powerful and beneficial divine magic. Many consider their connection to the divine stronger and more pure than any force of divine magic. After, a conventional acolyte might pray to his God, but when the Sacred Pleasurer gives herself to hers, she literally becomes the divine, incarnated on Earth for a few brief minutes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The fastest path into the Sacred Pleasurer advanced class is through the Dedicated Hero basic class, though other paths are possible.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Sacred Pleasurer in the Campaign

Like the Acolyte, the Sacred Pleasurer is a healer and intermediary between man and God. Like the acolyte, the Pleasurer is responsible for healing and strengthen the bonds between her friends. Though her methods are different, the Pleasurer’s results are similar. The particularly intimate nature of her magic means the Pleasurer’s blessings are particularly long lasting and potent, though she can also choose to cast the same quick and ef?cient ‘battle?eld buffs’ acolytes can.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Pleasurer is an oracle and soothsayer. While in her ecstatic trance, she mutters prophecy and divine wisdom. Teammates and allies will seek both her sexual favors and her mundane wisdom. As a being dedicated to the joy and pleasure of love, she is a natural enemy of the rapacious demons haunting Black Tokyo, and has a selection of abilities allowing her to bind and banish demon kind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Sacred Pleasurer may work closely with Department Seven or a similar group, but they rarely consider their temporal employer the ultimate authority over their lives. Like a chaplain stationed with the military, the Pleasurer will ?ght in the trenches with the rank and file, especially when confronting demonic evil, but answers to a more exalted chain of command. First and foremost, the Pleasurer serves her deity, and humanity as a whole, with the political interests of any mortal government taking a very distant place in her hierarchy of allegiances.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Requirements:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Special:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The Sacred Pleasurer must have declared one of her allegiances towards any benevolent deity or religion. Membership in any particular church or cult isn’t required; belief in itself is enough.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Banish Demon (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Sacred Pleasurer is a modern descendant of mankind’s earliest demon hunters. She stands at the borders of our reality, a shining example of love and holy truth in the face of unspeakable other-dimensional horror.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Starting at 2nd level, the Sacred Pleasurer can attempt to turn outsiders. She may turn any outsider in the same manner as an acolyte of equivalent level attempting to turn an undead creature. If the Sacred Pleasurer’s turning check result is high enough, she may destroy the demon utterly.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">If the Sacred Pleasurer is at least partially nude and bearing the physical signs of sexual arousal, she turns demons at +1 caster level. Demons cannot withstand the purity and carnal delight of the Pleasurer’s lusts.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Action Enhancement:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">If the Sacred Pleasurer spends an action point while making a turning check against demons, any creature successfully turned, but not destroyed must make an additional WILL Save (DC 18 + the Pleasurer’s WIS modi?er) or be blinded for the duration of the turning effect.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Blessing of the Yoni (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">For the Sacred Pleasurer, sharing an orgasm with willing supplicant binds the lover’s souls to each other and to the divine. The Pleasurer willingly gives of her body to bless worthy souls. Anytime the Pleasurer willingly brings another sentient creature to orgasm, that creature receives a minor supernatural blessing from the divine prostitute. Sacred Pleasures are oracles and advisors, offering wisdom and advice sweetened with passion and pleasure.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The supplicant receives a pool of ‘bonus’ points equal to the Pleasurer’s class level plus CHA modifier (minimum two points); which can be spent to improve the results of any one type skill check or saving throw, specified by the Pleasurer at the moment the creature orgasms. The supplicant may than choose to add the bonus points to any rolls with that skill in any amount desired. Any points not used before the supplicant next sleeps are simply lost.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A particular supplicant can only benefit from being blessed by the yoni once per 24 hour period. There is no limit to the number of supplicants a particular Sacred Pleasure may bless within a day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Chalice of the Divine (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The words and gestures of a conventional spell are a poor substitute for the Sacred Pleasurer’s sexual communion. Each day, rather than casting some spells in the usual manner, the Pleasurer may choose to imbue her vulva with divine magic, imbuing a number of spell levels equal to twice her WIS modifier (minimum two spell levels). She may choose to do so at any time, as a full round action. Imbued spells are lost for the day, as if the Pleasurer had cast them. A zero level spell casts as ½ a spell level for this purpose.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Example:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">A Pleasurer with a WIS score of 17 could choose to imbue upto 6 spell levels into her body. She could imbue her vagina with three 2nd level spells, with a 5th level spell and a first level spell, with six 1st first level spells or with any other combination of spell levels.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Once a spell is imbued, the Pleasurer can cast it to benefit herself as a purely mental action. In a quiet orgasmic burst, the spell takes effect. She may also choose to cast the spell on any lover, or any one who tastes her bodily ?uids. She may cast spells which normally have a personal range as a touch spell in this manner. If the Pleasurer chooses to cast a beneficial spell sexually, the duration of the spell is doubled. Instant duration spells, such as healing magic, have their numerical effects maximized instead.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Imbued spells not cast by the end of the day are simply lost.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Council of the Body (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">As the Sacred Pleasurer offers her body as a living altar, she is possessed by the spirit of her divinity, and shares the wisdom of the divine. While making love, the Pleasurer enters an ecstatic altered state. As the Pleasurer and her lover reach orgasm, the Pleasurer’s mind opens fully to the divine.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Once per day, while making love, the Sacred Pleasurer may cast augury with the certainty of success, concerning any action she or her supplicant plan to under take within the next day. When asking questions concerning romantic and sexual matters, the augury can foresee events up to a year and a day in the future.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In addition, if the Pleasurer concentrates on a particularly thorny problem before making love, her connection to the divine allows her to reroll any failed Knowledge check made within the past 24 hours. The Pleasurer may use this secondary aspect of the ability as many times as she wishes, but may only reroll a particular failed Knowledge check once.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Divine Calling:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Though she may not recognize any established church, though she may be marked as a heretic or cultist, the Sacred Pleasurer is a true divine magic user, called by the gods to serve Their will.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Sacred Pleasurer can cast a daily assortment of spells, and learn divine skills as an acolyte of equivalent level. The Sacred Pleasurer’s spell list is unique, and includes a selection of spells traditionally considered ‘arcane’, which are considered divine magic when she wields them.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Sacred Pleasurer considers her own body to be a symbol of godliness and purity, and does not require a holy symbol or other divine focus to cast spells or wield divine magic.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Rather than meditating or praying to recover her spells, the Sacred Pleasurer must engage in at least one hour of ritual sex with a willing partner, who understands the sacred nature of the act he or she is performing, or at least one hour of highly ritualized masturbation and Zen meditation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lessons of the Yoni (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Sacred Pleasurer uses her body to teach the lessons of her faith and strengthen the faith of her supplicants. While offering the Blessings of the Yoni to a supplicant, she may also choose to attempt to change that supplicant’s personality.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">If the Pleasurer chooses to use this ability, the supplicant must succeed at a WILL save (DC 18 + the Sacred Pleasurer’s WIS modifier), or have one of his or her allegiances change to match the Pleasurer’s own. A willing target can voluntarily forgo the save. Any supplicant whose allegiances change due to this class feature also receive a permanent +1 bonus on Knowledge: theology & philosophy checks, thanks to the brief glimpse of the Goddess the Pleasurer grants them.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A creature may only be affected by this ability once in its life. There is no limit to the number of times per day the Sacred Pleasurer can use this class ability.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Pleasurable Wards (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Sacred Pleasurer’s desire and joyous sensations forms an unbreakable divine barrier that a demon’s hatred and rage can never penetrate. By spending an action point and ritually masturbating, the Pleasurer can create an nearly unbreakable ward which most demons cannot enter.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A 60 ft spherical radius around the Pleasurer becomes warded. Any demon wishing to enter the warded area must succeed at a WILL Save (DC 22 + the Pleasurer’s WIS modifier). Success means the demon can force its way through the glistening divine membrane, but once inside the warded area is considered slowed by the potent sexual magic. Failure indicates the demon is trapped outside the barrier.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">No attacks, whether mundane or magical, made by a demon can penetrate the barrier, and all demonic spell effects stop at the barrier’s edge. This divine membrane remains in existence until the end of the encounter, or until the Pleasurer stops masturbating.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sacred Masturbation (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">By ritually bringing herself to orgasm before an audience of supplicants, the Sacred Pleasurer can arouse and enlighten. Stating at 5th level, if the Sacred Pleasurer ever performs sexually before a crowd, she may extend the Blessings of the Yoni to a number of audience members equal to her CHA modifier.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">All audience members receive the same amount of bonus points, which are all designated to enhance one particular kind of check, chosen by the Pleasurer during the performance.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Action Enhancement:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">By spending an action point during the ritual, assuming the act is recorded, the Pleasurer can extend the blessings to anyone seeing a photograph or video of the event. There is no limit to the number of supplicants that can benefit from the recording, but a viewer can only benefit from the Blessings of the Yoni the first time he or she sees the recording.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tantric Wisdom:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">At first level, the Sacred Pleasurer gains Tantric Wisdom (reprinted in the feats chapter) as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. If the character already has the feat, she receives no additional benefit.</p>
