<p class="pagecaption">The Death Womb Seductress</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Black Tokyo is a world of rape and inequality, of brutality and abuse, of twisted love and power fueled by rage, jealously and hate. Supernatural predators  are born out of every day atrocities. The Death Womb Seductress is a demonic predator, a shapeshifting spider that disguises herself as an appealing Black Tokyo club girl, a pretty piece of furniture.  She plays the vapid whore gleefully, giving the men she seduces exactly what they want: a glimpse between her delicate thighs. And more than anything about her demonic life, the Death Womb Seductress enjoys hearing a man’s shrill screams when he finally feels the secret she’s hidden there.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption"><a href="../../../GamingResources/Game_ESDs/ShadowRun/BlackTokyo/OG-001 Black Tokyo Final.pdf">Black Tokyo</a>: Profile of a Death Womb Seductress</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Death Womb Seductresses are cunning, deadly shapeshifters who wield their sexuality as a weapon, the same way it was used against them once. No matter where they come from or why they choose to swallow the spider demon’s eggs and become something inhuman, all Death Womb Seductresses share an origin. All have been victims: victims of rape, of brutality, of a gender they’ve developed a murderous contempt for. Empowered by vile supernatural forces, the Death Womb Seductress is an urban predator, who seduces and cannibalizes men, living well thanks to their spider-legged spells and ill gotten wealth.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The fastest path into the Death Womb Seductress is through the Charismatic Hero basic class, though other paths are possible.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Realms of the Hut: Profile of a Death Womb Seductress</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Death Womb Seductresses are cunning, deadly shapeshifters who wield their sexuality as a weapon. At one time, this was a gift from the Demon Queen of Spiders, Ishra, given to women who had been cruelly wronged and abused. A cult grew up around this aspect of Ishra and was open to any woman of any race.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once <a href="../npcs/aztol.htm">Aztol</a> captured <a href="../npcs/ishra.htm">Ishra</a>, he began forcing this on unwitting victims he had gathered. Once the new Death Womb Seductress is formed, it is fitted with a Controller Demon and brain-scan conditioned to follow orders from Aztol and his most trusted commanders. Aztol typically draws upon captured <a href="facedancers.htm">Face Dancers</a>, when he can, as the starting material for a new Death Womb Seductress.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Death Womb Seductress in the Campaign</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There’s no infiltrator more gifted and silver-tongued than a Death Womb Seductress. Properly motivated, the spider women can seduce or sneak their way virtually anywhere, and their well rounded skill set allows them to become top notch spies and assassins.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Seductress’ most likely role in the campaign though will be an antagonist. Most Death Womb Seductresses are broken by their early experiences, and further corrupted by the spider soul they’ve bound to their own. Murderous black widows with a taste for the finer things in life, they will invariably be responsible for high profile murders and disappearances among Black Tokyo’s male elite - exactly the murder victim profile an organization like Department Seven will be quickly tasked with investigating.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Captured Death Womb Seductresses are sometimes given a choice of involuntarily service or execution (though many of these dangerous
shapeshifters are summarily executed when their assignments end). As unquestioned masters of the spy game, clever Death Womb Seductresses often infiltrate and subvert the very organizations tasked with hunting them. An extremely rare few fight for justice and to protect women from predators (both mortal and
supernatural), but even the most noble Death Womb Seductress is a bloodthirsty, vengeful assassin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Black Cum (EX):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Death Womb Seductress’s center is as toxic and hostile to all life as a black widow spider. The Seductress’s fluids become a potent, deadly neuro toxin. Anyone tasting the Seductress’s blood, urine or vaginal secretions must succeed at a FORT save or succumb to the deadly toxin, and anyone injured by her razor edged vagina is at even greater risk.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This deadly poison only becomes deadlier as the Seductress gains age and wisdom. The Seductress can voluntarily suppress her toxic secretions to engage in non-lethal sex with a lover, and can allow her toxins to ?ow again at will, as a free action. The toxins quickly lose their potency, becoming inert seconds after leaving the creature’s body.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Example:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">A victim of a 10th level Death Womb Seductress’ toxin must attempt an additional FORT save, at the same DC each day of the recovery period, or the temporary ability damage becomes permanent drain instead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Blood Soaked Sheets (EX):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Death Womb Seductress’ razor-sharp pussy transforms itself into a blood thirsty, vampiric predator. While having sex with any male victim, instead of transforming her vagina into a razor storm, the Seductress can wreak a more subtle, and even deadlier vengeance. The creature’s vagina inflicts thousands of tiny, painless cuts and laps up the man’s spilled blood greedily.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Each round of sexual activity, the Seductress inflicts one point of CON drain on her unsuspecting lover. The lover must succeed at a WILL Save (DC 15 + the Seductress’ CHA modifier) to even notice the deadly assault; if he notices he can attempt to escape her warm and deadly embrace with a successful grapple check. Each round the hold is maintained the victim suffers a point of temporary CON drain.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Each point of CON drained allows the Seductress gains 5 HP; excess hit points are gained as temporary HP which are lost after a number of minutes equal to the Seductress’ CON score. Alternatively, the Seductress can choose to gain a temporary one point boost to her STR, DEX or CHA scores per point of CON drained. This temporary attribute boost lasts for a number of minutes equal to the Seductress’ CON score.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Once a creature is completely drained, the Seductress usually abandons the lifeless, mutilated husk and leaves in search of her next meal. There is no limit to the amount of power the creature can murder from her lovers.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The victim looks like a dried out, withered husk, half mumified, with a sallow yellowish complexion. The blood has turned to powder in the veins and there are countless small cuts and tears in the victim's genitals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dark Grace (EX):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Death Womb Seductress becomes inhumanly lithe and graceful; and she moves as nimbly as adroitly as the spider who skitters through her dreams. Starting at 2nd level, the Death Womb Seductress may add half her class level (rounded down) as a bonus on all Escape Artist, Perform (dance) and Profession (prostitute or courtesan) checks, as well as all Grapple checks due to her inhuman agility.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The creature is as comfortable moving on four legs as two, and suffers no penalty for engaging in melee combat while prone or for fighting in an unusual position.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Action Enhancement:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The Seductress has an unholy vitality, and with a few sickening pops can force dislocated bones into their sockets. The seemingly rubber bodied seductress may spend an action point to become resistant to blunt trauma. While enhanced, the Death Womb Seductress suffers only half damage from blunt/bludgeoning attacks. This enhancement lasts for a single encounter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Deathkiss (EX):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The same deadly fluids that flow between her legs moisten her lips. An 8th level Death Womb’s Seductress can spread her toxin with a kiss, or spit her venom with deadly accuracy.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Anyone kissing the Seductress must save against her toxin, as if it had been ingested. The Seductress can also spray a line of toxin with a 30 ft range as a standard action. Those stuck by the line of venom must save against the toxin as if it had been ingested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Faceless Fantasy (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Seductress is every man’s dream, a malleable demoness which can transform into the spitting image of any woman. As a full round action, which provokes attacks of opportunity, the Death Womb Seductress can reshape her features into another female form altering her appearance, physical age, race, skin color and texture, even seeming to alter her height and weight by 1 ft or 50 lbs in either direction.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This is a physical transformation, not an illusionary effect. The transformation affects the creature’s body, not her clothing or equipment. This shapeshifting ability grants the Death Womb Seductress a +10 bonus on Disguise checks. The Seductress gains the shapeshifter subtype.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Action Enhancement:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Death Womb Seductresses are skilled imitators and deceivers. The creature is attempting to imitate a specific woman, the Seductress may spend an action point after sampling the woman’s blood or vaginal secretions. She gains the ability to speak any languages the imitated woman knows and gains a +1 circumstance bonus on any skills the imitated woman has 10 or more ranks in.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This enhancement lasts for a number of hours equal to the Seductress’ CHA modifier (minimum one hour).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Night Eyes (EX):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Seductress’s eyes become incredibly keen and adapted to dim lighting. The Seductress gains low light vision.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Razor Slit (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Death Womb Seductress only orgasms as her partners scream and bleed; she can focus her hate between her legs, transforming her human vagina into a demonic maw of jagged teeth and rusty razor blades.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Transforming her vagina into a deadly vagina denta is a free action, which does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The Death Womb Seductress can use her razor slit as a deadly, if unusual natural weapon. Her razor slit is a natural secondary weapon, similar to a bite attack. The Seductress is always considered proficient in the use of this supernatural weapon, and always considered armed when attacking in this manner. Her razor sharp labia can easily tear through clothing to attack unwary adversaries, but due to the limitations of the attack form, the Seductress suffers a -5 penalty on attack rolls when fighting while standing.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Seductress’ preferred tactic is to transform her womb while having sex with a victim. The Seductress suffers no penalty on attack rolls when using this tactic, and can use this tactic normally when bound or grappling. This intimate attack automatically hits during sex, but the Seductress’ victim can attempt a REF save (DC 15 + the Death Womb Seductress’s class level) for half damage.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Seductress’ razored labia only become sharper and deadlier as she gains experience, as shown below.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Vaginal Ichor (SU):</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The spiderlike demoness can spray her fragrant vaginal juices like a hunting spider’s web, creating a seductive deathtrap. A number of times per day equal to one plus her CON modifier (minimum twice daily), the Death Womb Seductress can extrude highly adhesive hunting webs. The Seductress can cast web as an supernatural ability, as a mage of her total character level.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Normally, a Seductress only hunts with her wrist spinarettes, which resemble small vulvae on the underside of her forearms. If the Seductress can bring her genital spinarettes into play, the webbing is much denser and harder to escape from. If the creature uses both wrist and genital spinarettes, all saving throws and DCs associated with the web effect are increased by +2.</p>
