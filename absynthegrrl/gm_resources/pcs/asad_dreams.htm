<p class="pagecaption">Asad Dreams</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During the trip back from the Hive Queen you begin to have strange dreams. At first they are formless, leaving only a vague impression of loss and fear. The second night you slip into the same dream every time you manage to get back to sleep. You are wearing strange clothes and sitting in front of glowing screens. On these screens are printed strange words and patterns. The words are in strange contexts, not sentences, but some other kind of pattern. The screens you are staring at have many smaller sections on them, overlapped, each showing words, symbols, and images. Using simple hand movements and some odd device with depressable pads you can look at different sections.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The dream changes. You are sitting around a table, staring at very white, thin parchment with lots of numbers and words on it. In front of you are deep red, translucent gems shaped in various geometric shapes. As you stare at the paper, your view shifts until you see a wind-swept piece of hillside. You are crouched behind a cluster of rocks, staring out at a gigantic metal spider vomitting forth a large group of men, dressed in orange and black. Another person, crouching next to you leaps to his feet and runs toward the men. A hot violet, impossibly bright shaft of light blasts from the spider and shatters the rocks above you. The beam shoots again and flash burns the left arm off your companion. He falls screaming as you rush forward and pull him to safety. You wake in a cold sweat, the taste of terror still strong in your throat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You slip back into another dream. In this one you are walking in a deep forest with a group of heavily armed and armored men. They told you little of their mission, just that they needed you to find a path through the forest for them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The dream shifts and you are with the same men, looking down on a ruined and overgrown city. The men order you to wait for them. You were told to wait one day and then head back if no one came to meet you. You scouted around the edges of the ruin to pass time and to look for dangers from the forest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Near dusk you come across a strangely dressed skeleton in a depression in the center of a grove of trees. The clothing looked like robes rather than armor. Near its left hand was an oblong shaped box with a black snake-like tail coming out one end. The mouth of the serpent was filled with pointed little gold teeth, each tooth pointing out from the back of the snake’s mouth. It must have been dead as it did not move when you poked at it. The oblong box had rotting leather straps on it that might have at one time attached to the skeleton’s arm. Carefully turning it over you saw an intricate clasp holding a lid down on it. It seemed to be frozen shut, you could not get it to open with the gentle pressure you tried. Worried about damaging it or springing a hidden trap you placed it in your pack and looked at the skeleton once more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On its right hand you found a ring with a dragon head worked into it. Carefully you separated it from the skeleton and examined it more closely. It was exquisitely detailed with fine black hair for a crest, a small rainbow diamond formed an orb which it clutched in its paws, tiny specs of green diamond formed its eyes. Red enamel gave the head and paws their red color. The band was white gold.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You picked this up as well and placed it in your pouch. As you arrived back at the meeting place you could see two of the guards returning from the ruins. White faced and shaking they related that traps and terrors had killed the other ten men. Hastily you packed and left, returning to Shadizar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You were in the middle of relating this story to your friends at your favorite watering hole when the bright light and twisting, gut tearing sensation over-came you. As it faded you saw words scrolling in front of your eyes, too rapidly to follow. Once again you awaken in a cold sweat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Every time you drift to sleep in the egg thing, you are asailed by variations on these dreams. Each time they get a little bit more vivd, more real seeming, until you begin to question your sanity.</p>
