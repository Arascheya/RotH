<p class="regtxt5">Dream 1 - Riverwind - night between Miskaton and Azkelon</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A very detailed dream fades into your awareness near morning. It starts from your perspective and you are watching yourself write in a book. It rests on a lap table, resting across your knees as you sit cross-legged on a rich pillow. Your hand forms beautiful script in purple ink on the yellowed parchment of its pages.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">When you reach a break in the writing, you look up because the view has always comforted you. Around and above you is a throne, formed of a dragon skeleton. Your cushions rest in the pelvis and against the backbone. Overhead, the skull forms a canopy. Other bones form the rest of the chair, its legs, and its arms.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In front of you is an enormous chamber, stretching far into the distance. Flickering gold light dimly lights the columns that reach for the ceiling far overhead. The light glows from veins of gold in the obsidian of the glassy material forming the columns. Relief carvings of arcane symbols writhe in a slowly flowing pattern across the granite stones that form the floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Raising your gaze even higher, you look up to where the ceiling should be. A swirling spiral of lights floats in a black emptiness. (to visualize - think of a spiral galaxy being observed from a point far beyond it, where you could see it floating in the void, in all its glory) Beyond it are other swirls and clusters of lights.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A satisfied smile forms on your face as you relax even more, safe and comforted in your enfolding throne. You dip your pen into the bottle of ink and put it to the page again as the dream fades, disturbed by a low, resonant, gong sounding. The sensation is as physical as it is aural. However, when you sit up and look around, Goraze is still soundly asleep in his bunk, apparently unaware of any noise. You feel refreshed and awake, but vaguely saddened.</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dream 2 - Twelve Factols</p>

<p class="regtxt9">It woke you up, like a toothache, like a nagging memory just below conciousness. Drew you, still half asleep out the bedroom door, down the stone stairs to the first landing, and into the sitting room. A green spiderweb of light strands shimmered in the air between the two grey stone sphynx statues next to the right wall. It floated between their two facing heads, in a spot that had always been empty. It drew you, pulled at you, demanding you to move closer.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">At the very last minute you woke enough to run back to your room and dress before advancing to the web. At the touch of your hesitant hand you were spun through blackness to stand in front of a rough stone wall. Noise crashed over you, voices raised in countless dialects of strange languages. Odors of food, vomit, smoke, alcohol, and substances of unknown origin pummelled your nostrils. Dim light fought through the dense smoke to paint the large room in patterns of flickering red light.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">As your numbed senses began to recover you recognized a large tavern room, bustling with patrons and servers. The walls were carved and set stone and blocks. Across the room a wide stairwell rose. A dirty urchin, maybe nine or ten years old, tugged at your sleeve. "Miss Lady, there's a table over here. Come, sit, before you fall down. But 'member where your door is."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The urchin tugged you to a small table, set in a nook in the rough wall, and sat down opposite you. "It's ok, miss lady, you get used to it after a while." In the light from a flickering lamp on the table the urchin looked more like a young girl than a young boy. Her hand dug into a ragged pocket and emerged with a large cookie, wrapped in greasy paper. "Share my cookie? It's called oatmeal rasin and it's my favoretest in the whole world. Course I have to steal them cuz they're too 'spensive for me to buy."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The girl carefully unfolded the paper and solemnly broke the cookie in half, handing one part to you and taking a delicate bite out of the other piece. After a moment's hesitation you took a bite as well. Unimaginable pain crashed through your head, fragmenting it into colliding pieces. Each bump and grind bringing new levels of agony. The room spun, stars exploded and coalesced in front of you. You weren't sure if the shriek was only in your head or if your tortured voice gave forth with it.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You watched from a great distance as the urchin motioned a server over and asked for two glasses of klezarm blerkraz. "And who's going to pay for it, gutter-trash?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Miss lady will," she answered. The server looked your way and you must have nodded part of your head, because he grumbled something and left. He came back with two small glasses full of a billious yellow green slime and set them in front of you. "Take a sip, then a bite of cookie, then a sip, finishing everything with the drink. It will settle your head," the girl told you.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The first sip of liquid brough a lessening of the pain and an intesification of the images. You floated with in a circle with two others in the blackest void of space. Between you floated a ball of brilliant white light and a globe of absolute darkness. The three of you were chanting strange sounds, rising to a cresendo. At the peak the white light began to spew tendrils of flaming stuff while the black sphere collapsed into a deep well of nothingness. The tendrils fell slowly into the dark. "Welcome back, sister," the girl across from you spoke. Imposed on the urchin was a face of cold beauty. Her skin was grey, her hair white. "Finish your cookie and we will talk."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You finished the cookie and the drink, each bite and sip bringing the world more into focus and a reduction of agony. When you were done you could see the face still imposed over the urchin. "Sister, you have broken your own laws. You have invited a Power into your city," you said.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Well, they are more guidelines, actually, but you are right, there will be a price, but there always is, isn't there? "</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dream 3</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Once more you enter the realms of dream and slowly become aware of your surroundings. Overhead a rough surface of lumpy material is painted in vivid swirls and patterns of rich color. You are reclining on a medium sized bed, on top of a worn, forest green, coverlet. The room around you is small, almost claustrophobic, with two bedside tables, a battered dresser, and an armoire. A chipped mirror hangs above the dresser and a thick cloth hanging, with a geometric pattern, separates this area from another space.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Beside you, on the bed, is the familiar book and pen.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Once again, a deep, rolling gong sound wakes you to the narrow bunk in the contraption where you and the others are being held captive.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The next time you take out your book to look at it, there is a small leather pouch attached to the spine. Inside it is a platinum tube with one end blunt and the other end narrowing to a rounded point. A small strand of deep purple silk ties the metal tube to the leather pouch. There is enough silk cord to allow you to move the metal object around an area slightly larger than the open book would be.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">/* describe pull of Sphynx Gate and urchin in Twelve factols - about ten, female, offers cookie - oatmeal, raisin, that unlocks the Keeper - then orders klezarm blerkraz to settle the mind - after the first bite of cookie the essence returns but leaves Irena's mind feeling fragmented and her head like it is pieces rubbing together in migrain-like pain - the drink calms it - drink costs 10 gp per small glass, the urchin has Irena pay for both when the server looks oddly at her */</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dream - ?? - 12 Factols 2</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You step through the web of green light, into the smoky tavern, and turn toward the table you regard as your own. The other two are already there, the grimy urchin and the tall woman in a hooded black robe. As you start toward them a voice calls from behind you, "Lady Irena!"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Ba'aztyka. How are you?" you reply to the tall succubus behind you.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I am well, Lady. How are you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I am well."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Wonderful! Do you have a moment, Lady? There is something new in our cellars I'd like to show you."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I...," you start to refuse until you see the look of nervousness in her eyes. "Certainly."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ba'aztyka expertly threads you through the crowded common room, behind the bar, and into a large store room. "Lady, there are Rumors, and I don't know what to do."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Rumors, what kind of rumors?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"The Factols, the leaders of the city factions of power, speak of She Who Must Not Be Named violating her own rules and bringing her Sisters, the other two Greater Powers, into the Sealed City."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"How are the Centrons reacting?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"They are scared, Lady. If the rumors are true, it could spell the end."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Ba'aztyka, please, just call me Irena."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I..I forget, L...Irena. You are honored by the Circles and Levels of the Abyss as the Butcher of Iridanifaal and the Demon of the Galhai. The heavens honor you as the Salvation of Seconus and the Giver of Peace in your Empire. You are the Mistress of the Hut. One as lowly as I should not use your name."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"You are my friend. That gives you more right than any of the princes of the heavens or the hells. What do the Factols want?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"They want She Who Must Never Be Named to abide by her own laws. They want her to appear and publically appologize to them for her actions and they want her to include them in the ruling of Centrys. If she refuses, some of them want to breach the Seals and let the godlings, gods, and other powers in to play. Two of the most vocal want to throw Her down and usurp her rule. It is blasphemy, L..Irena. Blasphemy and madness of the highest order. What should I do? What can be done? You are one of the highest allowed in. Could you talk to Her for me and tell her most of us fear the Factols? They are mad at the best of times and now they would bring our destruction."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Seems to me She has every right to do as She wishes without interference from temporals. She is the ruler and heart of the city after all."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"But they are threatening to break the Seals!"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"No one sees Her, but She runs the city. She must have ways of listening, which means She's likely already heard you. I suppose I could go and kill these beings, if you think that would help."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"It wouldn't. There'd be twenty more to take their place. I hope you're right. Even the Lords of the Abyss are nervous."</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt9">Butcher of Iridanifaal, The Demon of the Galhai - regard of the levels and circles of the Abyss, Peacemaker of the Galaxy, Salvation of Seconus - regard of the heavens</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dream ? - Centrys Spire from the Plains of Concordant Discord</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Once again you fade into a view from the dragon throne with the book open in your lap. As you lift the pen to write a deep, resonant gong sounds. "Mistress, we have arrived. What Cameleon and DefCon settings would you desire?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"No Cameleon and DefCon One please. And please set up the external view in full field mode. Thank you Tyana." You say to the air around you.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The air shimmers around you until a semi-transparent view fades in. The view surrounds you, as if you stood in the center of a garden of odd and beautiful plants. A hexagonal fence of bones and skulls surrounds the flowers and thick, emerald grass. Beyond the fence is a lush green clearing in the center of a forest of deciduous trees. Overhead the sky is perfect and blue, with a warm sun shining down.  In the distance an impossible spire shoots up through the clouds and out of view.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Close view," you call and the image fades away, returning you to the dragon throne.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dream 2 - ??</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The room is open, airy, and spacious. A large low bed rests in the center of the room, surrounded in intricate lace curtains. A low desk sits in a corner near an arched door. Large windows, covered in patterned wooden screens, look out over a small courtyard with fountains and plantings.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You cross to the small table, slide open the drawer, and remove a candle from within. You place this in a small brass holder, where it sits behind a photo of a smiling older woman wearing strange clothing. You pick up a device from the table, click it, and use it to light the candle.</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dream 3 - ??</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You are comfortably sprawled on the cushions of the bone throne. This time the throne rests in a room panelled in rich woods and tapestries. A pentegram is carved into the rich stone floor. Arcane symbols swim in the various sections of the pentagram and the star inscribed within it. At the four other points large wing-back chairs rest, each occupied by another person. One has wings carefully folded behind her. Two others stand beside the chairs nearest you. One is a tiger woman, the other, a very pale human. A large panther is curled up between the two chairs farthest from you, next to another standing woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A conversation is in progress around you. "Are you sure we can instance this device?" you ask.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Yes," the thin, hard edged woman to your right replies.</p>
