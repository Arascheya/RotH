<p class="regtxt5">Hello, my name is Tatyana Zerina Merilen Cheryenko Petrovka, Tyana to my friends.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I bring a message from the Trickster. Do not trust the web weavers in their webs. Both cost her her daughter. One, the Watcher in the Web, from over-protectiveness and the other, the Perverter of Spiders, because he is a monster. Trust your Seers and the Trickster. They are the only ones you can truly trust. You shall know something is from the Trickster for her sign will be within the giving. When things become too confusing, I will try and get a sign to you on which way to go. I cannot break you free of the simulation. You must finish it. The Watcher in his Web must be appeased and I dare not cross him directly. In return She asks you hunt for her lost daughter. The little daughter that fell off the high shelf and could not land without breaking.</p>
