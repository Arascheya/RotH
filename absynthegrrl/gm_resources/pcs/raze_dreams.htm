<p class="sectioncaption">Dream of Shandi</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One of the driders carried a limp form into the room. He set it gently into one of the overstuffed chairs. Aztol looked up and motioned imperiously. You stand slowly and shuffle forward. You feel tired, drained almost to exhaustion. Your hands are wrinkled, cracked and old looking. The green gown you wear hangs loosely from your shrunken frame. You gaze at Aztol through tired eyes. "Secure her," he says imperiously.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You turn to the figure in the chair. She is young, probably late teens, maybe just a bit older. Someone has dressed her in a simple white dress. It isn't settled quite right for the girl to have donned it herself. Slowly you draw the spell up and cast the bindings around her ankles and wrists. When you finish you shuffle towards the door. His voice stops you. "No, in the shadows, sit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Like an obedient dog you shuffle back to a hard backed chair and collapse limply into it. The room is one of the few ornate rooms in the spider ship. It is paneled in expensive and exotic woods and has many bookshelves along the walls. A rich carpet covers the hardwood floor. Several overstuffed chairs cluster together to form a cozy space in the center of the room. Glowing magic lamps spill warm light in pools.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a moment you stare at Aztol. He is medium height and build. His hair is dark blonde, his face wide and almost handsome, except for the cruel sneer that he always wears. His eyes are brilliant violet. He wears rich arcane robes even though he has no skill in the arts. You can tell he knows you are studying him, but you are beneath his notice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aztol points a wand at the figure in the chair and she wakes with a startled gasp. He pastes a warm, friendly expression on his face that comes nowhere near his eyes and speaks to the girl in the chair. "Good morning Shandi. Sometimes the old simple spells are the best. Take the "Sleep" spell for example. It is so low powered and ordinary that few use it. Yet if you adjust it just a little it becomes quite useful again. Instant unconsciousness followed by instant wakefulness. None of the nasty drowsiness effects of drugs or poison. The target awakes fully aware and quite often rested as well." His face smiled at her but his violet eyes remained cold and aloof. "Ah, but I am being rude. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Aztol. I would like to welcome you to my city, although we aren't exactly in it right now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do I know you?" Shandi tries to stand only to find your spells holding her fast to the chair.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm crushed, you mean that..." he struggled with himself before continuing in a strained voice, "you father," the word was almost hissed, "didn't mention me?" He tried to look hurt but he only managed to look annoyed instead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I don't think he did. Why can't I move? Let me up! I'm no threat to you. Please, just let me go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well now," his composure had restored itself. "I actually would have done that. I like to meet the people stumbling through my garden. It wouldn't be friendly not to. Then I let them continue on their way. You could have as well, it's just that as your father's daughter I thought we should talk. I'm sure there is so much you could tell me..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi struggled against the invisible bonds that held her, pulling and twisting until she sat breathing heavily from the exertion. "Please my dear girl, don't strain yourself. A colleague of mine was quite careful when she cast those restraint spells. I wouldn't want you to muss up that pretty dress you are in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi stopped and looked down at herself. "It's quite lovely don't you think?" Aztol asked conversationally. "It suits a young woman of your beauty so much better than those nasty, sweaty things you were wearing in the garden. I hope you don't mind. I must say though it was rather a chore to fit you. You are so thin for your age. Seems that father of yours isn't a very good parent. Although I'd suspect nothing better of that piece of..." He bit his words off again. "I am truly sorry my dear. Your father and I have had a few disagreements over the years about certain policies. He has made me so very angry."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want from me? Why am I restrained?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am going to return you to your father of course. I want you to carry a message back to him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I still don't.."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He eyes looked almost sad as he explained, "It is a very special message. One that says I can get at him were ever and when ever I want. I fear you will be the message. But first we must prepare you for your new role. I almost wish... Well, such youth and innocence, it seems such a waste... But the bastard must pay. I will squeeze his balls until they pop! And you my dear young thing shall be the instrument of my message." Shandi shrank back into her chair in terror as she saw the madness dancing in his eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He stood abruptly. "No, you silly girl, I'm not going to kill you. There would be no enjoyment in that. I have other business to attend to. I shall leave you in the tender care of Kaltereth, the arcane colleague I mentioned earlier." He raised his voice slightly, "Kaltereth, my dear, would you be so kind as to show Miss Revenge to her new rooms? Thank you. I should like to see her at dinner, properly dressed of course."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You rise slowly and move hesitantly to the chair. With a few hand motions you relax the restraint spells long enough to release her from the chair. Then you re-form them as hand cuffs and foot hobbles. Your voice comes out tired and empty as you say, "Come with me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You lead Shandi out into a paneled corridor. Shandi stops just outside the door and asks, "What is that horrible sound?" It brings the shrieking howls of souls in torment back to your awareness. For a time you had almost managed to block out their constant noise.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aztol captured this ship from Ishra, the Demon Queen of the spiders. She fashioned it from the souls of the damned in her realms. If you live here long enough you can almost learn to ignore it, almost..." Kaltereth answered in her lifeless voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Twisted fuck!" You turned a startled smile on Shandi. "Yeah, I know the bad words too." Shandi said through a defiant grin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You just seem so young."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My father kept me wrapped in cotton and placed on a high shelf. He thought he could keep me safe from damage and the deadly world outside. But I craved adventure, so I fell off the shelf and found a path. I had hoped for dragons and wizards and battles. Looks instead like I found something else. He never understood the damage the shelf and cotton would cause."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry girl, you found your way into a blood feud instead." You walk slowly along the passageway giving Shandi plenty of time to study the walls and ceilings. It was opulent and fancy. Rich woods glowed with polish and care. Heavy hangings provided spots of color. Various paintings were carefully framed and hung with a precise eye. Most of them were disturbing abstracts of dark and violent colors swirled together in mad eddies. "Aztol painted them," You explain when you see Shandi studying them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He's mad you know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who?" You ask, puzzled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aztol. He's like my father, driven by a warped dream of how things should be. They both want to sit in their webs and pull the threads of others to make it happen. But it can't happen. What they want won't work with real people."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You hiss frantically, "The walls have ears. Be careful what you say girl!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, it's not a problem. He knows he's mad and he revels in it. He will return me to my father."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not that simple."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi turned sad eyes to you and replied, "I know. He is going to damage me first. I could see it in his eyes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn it girl, how can you be so calm?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have a name you know, at least for a while longer it is mine. I am calm because terror has passed beyond what my mind can handle and I am walking in slow motion now. I could have hysterics, I could fight against your spells, but it won't change anything. My mother always told me a moment of silent inspection can tell you more than an hour of conversation. For example I know you will be doing the damage rather than him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her words freeze you in your tracks. Shandi, still looking at the paintings, stumbles into you as you ask, "How?" </p>

<p class="regtxt5">You can't manage to say any more but she answers the question you were trying to ask anyway. "His mind is too chaotic, like my father's. Now Auntie Stormy, she's like you, calm, deep, an ocean of power waiting to be tapped. Any disturbances are on the surface, waves upon the deep. You will do it for him. What I don't understand is why."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You manage a shaky laugh, "You are scary, do you know that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. Like my mother I am random, mercurial, shifting, and unexpected. It is the source of our strength. Sadly I don't have it down yet. I should have done better with asshole, umm Aztol."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He's listening to us. You don't want to make him angry." Once again you try and warn her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He already is angry. I can't change that. It is why he does what he does. It's like you do what you do out of fear and despair. You can escape you know. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but there is always a way out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have thought to do that," You say slowly as you glance at your wrists.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That way is too obvious. Starvation is too obvious as well. Make the other person die for their cause as my father would say."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He'll kill me if I try."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are strong. My mother had visions, mostly as fragments. Auntie Stormy was powerful as well, and my father was mad. I never told mother that I could See. She was always so sad from hers. Too much pain and death. She should have remembered more of the good ones. I See good for you. You will escape and find happiness. I-She will escape as well and find, well, a way...and friends, finally there will be self chosen friends."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no I'm not strong. He offered knowledge and I came running, just like a puppy for food. I had heard the rumors of his madness and still I came. Then when he continued to hold the offers over my head I hung on his every crumb rather than turn away. I have done his dirty work for years now and I'm still no closer to what I was promised. If I were strong I'd have left long ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi cocked her head slightly and said, "Maybe you just need the right reason."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly the air shimmered and tore. The walls shivered and faded into a transparent grey for a brief moment as the howling shrieks rose to a crescendo. As suddenly as it had begun it ended leaving Shandi staring at the walls around her. "That was so pretty. What was it?" she asked in a wondering voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are returning to Aztol's fortress in the other dimensions. He has a palace located outside the normal ways of time. Now there truly is no escape." You stop as you arrive at a brass studded door of oak. "Here is your suite. I will return for you in time to help you dress for dinner. Your restraints will release once the door is sealed. At least he is letting you be comfortable. Some of his 'guests' he places in the cells below." You motion Shandi through the door. After a moment of hesitation she walks proudly through the door. You close and lock it behind her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The dream shifts to a new time. You are back in front of the door, opening it this time. You step inside and shuffle to the bed where Shandi is sitting in rigid stillness. "You need to dress now. Dinner will be soon."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am dressed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You need to wear something much nicer than what you have on now. In the armoire there are many choices."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, but only if you start eating again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's that got to do with it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You won't be able to leave if you are too weak to do anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is no escape." You reply through a harsh and bitter laugh.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is." Shandi reaches out and takes hold of your hands. "You must believe me. Remember you are strong and we will escape. None of this is your fault. I forgive you. I won't be able to tell you later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What the hell are you saying?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi gives you a twisted, sad smile, "I fell off the high shelf and now there is no way to land without breaking. I must give way so she may live."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who? So who can live?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You will meet her once I am gone. Now, will this work for dinner?" Shandi held up a blood red gown trimmed in silver that went nicely with her hair and eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, uh, yes, that will work..." You answer slowly. Shandi pushes you out of the room. A few minutes later she emerges dressed in the finery. It looks stunning on her and for a moment fiery regret for what will happen flashes through you. It fades as you lead her to the dining room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Revenge, you sit here, near me at this end of the table. Kaltereth you may sit next to her." Aztol states as you enter the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have a name."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is not relevant." Shandi held her tongue as she dug into the vast amounts of rich foods placed in front of her. When Aztol wasn't as attentive she would slide the best bits to Kaltereth and watch until she would eat them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was hoping to begin your preparation, however I find there are other things that must command my attention for the next few days. Kaltereth, you may show Revenge back to her rooms." Aztol rose and walked toward the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She loved you, you know." Shandi spoke calmly but clearly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aztol stopped in his tracks. "Whom did?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mirenda, of the bath house. In the city where you first met the dark warrior woman you abandoned on Mintashri 3."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You couldn't know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In a voice laced with scorn Shandi replied, "I have Seen you. You are no different than my father. You are users, unable to act for yourselves. You are pathetic."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aztol grabbed a meat knife and strode over to Shandi. He raised the knife and plunged it toward her heart. She made no move to stop him. At the very last instant he stopped. Fires of madness danced in his eyes as he hissed out, "Very clever girl, but not clever enough." Breathing heavily and fighting for control he turned to you. "Take her to the brain scan and secure her. Then bring the stasis box from the vaults. We will begin tonight after all." He stalked from the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Idiot!" you snarled at Shandi.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He must be angry and he must start tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Idiot child," you said sadly. "Will you come? Or do I need to bring you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will come. It ends the same either way." Shandi followed you out the door. You led the way further down the ornate corridor and then onto plain iron steps. The shrieking of the hull became louder as you descended. At the bottom was a plain iron corridor. Turning left you walked down the corridor to a heavy steel door. Struggling you slowly pulled it open to reveal racks and racks of blinking lights and elaborate technological gear. In the center of the room were two massive chairs. In one was a ebony skinned woman with white hair. Her fine features were slack and her eyes stared sightlessly into the ceiling. A large cap of clear crystal sat on her head. Within it pulsed and swirled lazy patterns of purple motes. You remember her as Ishra, Demon Queen of Spiders. You had heard about the capture of her from others in the ship. It had been a long and dangerous adventure in which Aztol had played no part, even as he took full credit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My father has one of these."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aztol stepped around one of the pieces of equipment. "Yes he does. The rat bastard was going to use it on me if I didn't bend to one of his schemes." He motioned to the empty chair. "If you please, Revenge. It's easier if Kaltereth doesn't have to put you in for me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi hesitated, struggling with herself for long moments, and then walked stiffly to the chair. "Get on with it then. You and my father, spineless fools meddling in a universe where you are irrelevant. You forge your undoing this night. Better for you had you killed me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He slipped up to her and stroked her face lightly, "Spout your useless words. I have the power and you do not. I am going to enjoy what is in store for you. First I am going to bury your intelligence behind a shell of idiocy. Then I will give you terror of magic and technology. That way you won't let your precious father attempt to fix you. Oh, yes, and I will make it almost impossible for you to speak of it, or at all for that matter. I will inject your body with the extracts of various creatures. You will be fast, furious, and deadly. A time bomb waiting to attack anything that threatens you. I will harden you and speed you up until you can survive almost anything. And for the last I shall embed a message specially for your father. One last little bomb so you, his darling daughter, will strike him down as the biggest threat to yourself. At last I will squeeze his balls until they pop!" He turned to you, "What, are you still here? Where are those supplies you were to bring? Be quick about it!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You stared in shocked horror at Shandi. It wasn't until you saw her small nod that you could bring yourself to stagger out the door. Slowly you turned and walked back down the corridor, past the stairs up, and to a locked vault further on. Your hands moved through the complicated locking sequence and the door swung open.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the far corner was the box Aztol wanted. Silver tubes attached it to the walls. It took a few minutes to remember how the connections worked. Frigid gas hissed briefly as you pulled the last connection loose.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Moving slowly you headed back to the room with Shandi. You wanted to run, to throw the box away, but there was no place to go inside his pocket dimension, even if you could get off the ship. Silently you placed the box on the table next to Shandi and turned to go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You will stay," Aztol said. "I will have need of your skills shortly." He was already at the large console directing the changes to Shandi's brain. With a satisfied sound he turned his attention to the stasis box. It opened to reveal six jars of faintly tinted liquids. Selecting all of them and taking a large syringe from another table he drew up generous quantities of each one. "Cast that malleability spell of yours now. The one that prevents rejection of foreign tissue."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You stood motionless until he looked up at you. "Do not block me woman. You would be less use with a Rider Demon attached, but don't think I won't do it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You stalked forward stiffly and cast the spell. As the energies boiled around Shandi Aztol slammed the injection into the veins in her neck. She writhed in silent agony as it burned its way through her blood. "Now a flesh to ethereal spell targeted on her head. If you think to kill her imagine one of my torturers peeling the flesh from your body for days. And remember I have enough healing potion to keep repeating your skinning for as long as I like." Silent tears tracked your face as you cast the second spell. Aztol was smiling as he placed the small demonoid against Shandi's face. As it eased its way inside he chanted over and over, "Now I squeeze his nuts until they pop, the arrogant prick."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi's scream of agony was the last sound you heard as you dropped into unconsciousness.</p>
