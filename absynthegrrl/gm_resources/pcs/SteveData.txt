will vaguely remember 1890's London and working as Jekyll. will remember Lucy the most.

Dr. Henry Jekyll

You awaken in a cold stone room. You are lying on a slab of marble. The room is lit by several candles scattered around. The thing notice almost right away is there are no doors out of this room, at least none you can see. Listed below is what you know and remember.

In this version of the 1890's: Charles Babbage invented the Difference Engine and Lord Wellingham financed its construction. Vampires are real. Sherlock Holmes exists. The watcher's Council is alive and well with the current slayer being Princess Maria of Roumania. Her watcher, Dr. Abraham von Helzing was killed recently in a vampire attack.

Lord Willem Wellingham is an adventurer businessman. He began young, easily convincing his father, Lord Artemis Wellingham, of his abilities as he seemed to have an excellent sense of what to buy or sell and exactly when. He was given control of his father's stocks in a continental rail company, Compagnie Internationale des Wagon-Lits. He rapidly parleyed his father's stocks into controlling interest and bought out the other holders in 1892.

His father had also invested in an obscure bit of technology known as the Difference Engine. Willem immediately saw the potential of this device and in 1889 found a way to produce gears and components of sufficient quality to build functioning units. By 1892 he had the process inexpensive enough that he could sell commercial units. He spun off International Computing Machines to handle the new business.

In 1894 he formed another business unit, Computational Solutions International. This business division produces programs for the new Computational Engines. His wife, Anne, is the Chief Programmer and Chairwoman of this new venture. Lucy Wellingham, his daughter is Senior programmer of the Engineering Science Solutions group. Her friend Wilhelmina Murray is Project Manager for the Coordination Control Program, the resource management part of the engine code.

You were a research medical doctor, at least you think you might have been. You also remember dating Lucy Wellingham whom you met through a mutual friend, Dr. Jack Seward. In an amazingly short time you have swept Lucy away from her other suitors, who included your friend Jack, an American named Quincy Adams, and Arthur Holmwood.

You also have memories of a place where the technology was much more advanced than here. The idea of a transdimensional device, such as the other characters are in, makes sense to you. Buried in your memories are something similar that you believe you were trying to repair.

There are memories of a peaceful place where you were pretty high up in the order of things. It was a pleasant life but seemed to be lacking in excitement. Then come memories of an invasion by groups of people wearing black and orange uniforms. They were the shock troops for someone named Aztol. He was seeking access to the technology of your people. You and a hand picked group destroyed as much of it as you could before you fled in the device you want to fix.

You remember crashing in an alley near where you lived in London and being helped by a rather strong young woman named Drusilla. You remember introducing Drusilla to Lucy shortly before Lucy became sick in some way. It was strange enough that it really has your friend Jack Seward quite concerned. A disease of the blood he called it and sent for his mentor Dr. von Helzing.

Drusilla helped you find the recently empty home of Dr. Henry Jekyll. You replaced the reclusive Dr. Jekyll and began working to repair your device. To maintain a cover you introduced a few medical marvels that were common place things from your time.

There are a few memories that seem almost too disjointed to be real. There is a memory of a huge spider-like thing that materialized into the center of the city where you lived shortly before you escaped. Then there is a disturbing half memory of some grey skinned horror slashing you with razor sharp claws before blackness settled in.

things are starting to come back:
The cleaner air in the Hut reminds you that you didn't always live in the smoke and soot filled air of London. You were once the leader of the Timelord COuncil on Gallifrey. At that time you sneared at the Dr. and his interventionist rants. You believed like the rest in the inate superiority and ascendancy of the Timelords. That you should sully yourselves mucking about in the time lines and changing or damaging the time stream was unthinkable.

Then came the spider thing. At first it sat outside the city and a small group came to the council demanding immediate surrender to Aztol. The council laughed and sent the representatives back to the upstart.

Then came the troops. Within hours they had cut through the city's defences. You organized what resistance you could and then you and several trusted assistants began destroying the TARDISes that remained in the city and the navigation beacons that would draw any in the field back in. The last action you took was to take the Key of Rassilon and the last TARDIS and flee to prevent the spider ship from getting control of the slaved black hole that was part of the TARDIS power and control system.

You crashed in London where Drusilla showed you to an abandoned house. Here you set up residence posing as Henry Jekyll. It took a fair amount of work but you believe you have successfully assumed his identity. You were helped by the fact his close friends reported him behaving strangely for some time before you arrived on the scene. Drusilla has confided to you that she killed a Henry Hyde not long before Jekyll's house became abandonend.

You remember being interested in CIWL as soon as you heard about it. Anyone working on computing machines should be able to help you get your TARDIS back online. Through your friend Dr. Jack Seward you were introduced to Lucy Wellingham, the daughter of the owner and controller of CIWL, Lord Willem Wellingham. The two of you got along better than you would have expected. Not only was she pretty but she was brilliant besides. You were just about to tell her everything about where you came from and what you needed when she became sick.

Jack was extremely quiet about what was wrong with her and how she was being treated. You were going to take a cab out to the estate and demand answers the morning after the night you were attacked.

For additional 1890s data - ask me when you need it. this should catch the high-lights...
