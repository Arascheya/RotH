In this version of the 1890's: Charles Babbage invented the Difference Engine and Lord Wellingham financed its construction. Vampires are real. Sherlock Holmes exists. The watcher's Council is alive and well with the current slayer being Princess Maria of Roumania. Her watcher, Dr. Abraham von Helzing was killed recently in a vampire attack.

Lord Willem Wellingham is an adventurer businessman. He began young, easily convincing his father, Lord Artemis Wellingham, of his abilities as he seemed to have an excellent sense of what to buy or sell and exactly when. He was given control of his father's stocks in a continental rail company, Compagnie Internationale des Wagon-Lits. He rapidly parleyed his father's stocks into controlling interest and bought out the other holders in 1892.

His father had also invested in an obscure bit of technology known as the Difference Engine. Willem immediately saw the potential of this device and in 1889 found a way to produce gears and components of sufficient quality to build functioning units. By 1892 he had the process inexpensive enough that he could sell commercial units. He spun off International Computing Machines to handle the new business.

In 1894 he formed another business unit, Computational Solutions International. This business division produces programs for the new Computational Engines. His wife, Anne, is the Chief Programmer and Chairwoman of this new venture. Lucy Wellingham, his daughter is Senior programmer of the Engineering Science Solutions group. Her friend Wilhelmina Murray is Project Manager for the Coordination Control Program, the resource management part of the engine code.

Prince Sergei Dracul
/********************************************************************************************

Prince Sergei Dracul - Born Vlad Tepes - now vampyr

Prince Sergei Dracul uses a brother's name to avoid recognition by western leaders. He was a hero of the Wallachian/Moldavian/Transylvanian people and was killed by the Turks after his wife was tricked into committing suicide. As vampyr he is working under existing politics to undo the reigns of terror inflicted after the death of Stephen, his brother, and himself. He seeks the re-incarnated soul of his lost love as well. An old gypsy seer told him he would meet his love once more in a great city to the west. This inspired his move to London.

Sergei meets Mina when she is about in the city. He strikes up a conversation with her and things proceed from there. Soon they are dating, even though Mina had been pledged to marry Jonathan Harker, an up and coming young solicitor. By the time the game is in full swing these two are very close.

Jonathan Harker had visited Sergei at castle Bran shortly before Sergei's departure. Jonathan left and as far as Sergei knew had successfully returned to London. In actuality Jonathan was way-laid by brigands and murdered for his papers and money. Sergei did not hear of his fate until a letter arrived for Mina.

Not content to remain in Transylvania Prince Sergei originally started acquiring properties in Budapest and then in Prague and Bucharest. In all cases he favored hotel/ inn type properties. This allowed him secure places to reside when travelling. It was while travelling in Roumania that he encountered Princess Maria and became her friend.

In 1879 Sergei invested heavily in a theatre and hotel interest started by Richard D´Oyly Carte whom he knew of through a solicitor, R. M. Renfield, he had engaged for other business interests. He also purchased Carfax Abbey, located next to Jack Seward's sanatorium.

Lord Willem Wellingham
/********************************************************************************************

Lord Willem Wellingham - Born 1847 to Lord Artemis Wellingham.

Willem has always been an adventurer, starting as soon as he was able. His father was forever extricating him from scrapes at school and later throughout the country-side.

His adventurous nature extended into his dealings with money and stocks. Once he demonstrated his abilities his father turned over control of his stocks to Willem. By 1884 he had parleyed his father's part interest in Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL) into controlling interest. In 1892 he has used his fortunes to buy out Georges Nagelmackers and take complete controller interest in the company.

In the early 1860's Lord Willem's father, Lord Artemis, used some of his money to buy the concept of Babbage's Analytical Engine. Lord Artemis was using it as an excuse to give an old friend money, however young Willem immediately saw the true potential of this device and became obsessed with creating a working version. It was through this invention that he met his wife, Anne. By 1888 he has exhausted all avenues of research aimed at fabricating the precision parts necessary to build a fully functional unit.

In 1889 a fluke accident at the WL headquarters in London gives him the answer. A mysterious doorway opens in the basement of the facility and Willem along with several trusted companions go through. One of the trusted companions is Andrew Murray, Mina's father and the comptroller of CIWL. They find themselves in beautiful downtown Centrys, actually rather a hell-hole of a place with weird beings scurrying about. After a couple of narrow escapes from run-ins with the locals they rescue one of the odd beings who becomes the ICM chief engineer. This being has a tremendous knowledge of mechanical engineering and materials fabrication. With its knowledge the CIWL company produces the first working full scale Babbage Engine. Soon they are building them on contract and selling these Computational Engines world wide. In 1893 Lord Willem creates International Computing Machines to handle production, distribution, programming, and maintenance of the new Computational Engines. Using ideas and knowledge from his chief engineer these machines rapidly evolve from Babbage's beginning concepts.

Lord Willem, Andrew Murray, and Artemis Harker form the basis of the Keepers of the Doors soon after their return with the Chief Engineer.

Anne Wellingham becomes involved as soon as Lord Willem mentions the computing machines to her. Using her mother's notes she develops the basic language for programming these new systems. Once this occurs Lord Willem begins on his most audacious undertaking, the creation of a Channel Tunnel. Once again he relies heavily on his chief engineer for materials designs to support his developments. Using the recent developments of electricity the plans are to run electrically powered helper engines to move trains through the "Chunnel".

/********************************************************************************************
Lady Anne Isabella Wellingham
/********************************************************************************************

Anne Isabella Noel King was born in 1837 to Ada King, Lady Lovelace. She was her mother's daughter, constantly picking her mother's brain about mathematics and Babbage Engine programming. Also like her mother she was greatly disappointed when Babbage could not get a working engine going. She had all but given up hope until Lord Artemis Wellingham bought the concept from an aging Babbage. His son, Willem, had as much enthusiasm for the machine as she did. Together they worked every angle to try and get a working prototype.

She is older than Lord Wellingham by ten years, however they are very much in love. One of the things she finds most attractive about him is his ability to see her as a person rather than just a woman. This is one of her lessons to Lucy and her friend Mina, demand the respect due all people, particularly in potential mates. She was extremely disappointed when Lucy had planned to marry Arthur Holmwood. In him she saw the usual condescension of a typical man of the time. She has greater hopes for her daughter's current suitor, the enigmatic, but charming Dr. Jekyll.

She has always encouraged Lucy to excel in the sciences, paying for tutors and additional resources when the local schools wouldn't accept that girls could learn those things. Mina was another beneficiary of this attitude. As the daughter of the Wagon Lit comptroller and close friend of Lucy she also benefited from this situation.

/********************************************************************************************
Daughter Lucy
/********************************************************************************************

Lucy is a study in contrasts. As a senior programmer at ICM she is hard working and brilliant. Yet outside work she comes across as a typical distracted socialite. Arthur has seen some of this, although he is secretly plotting to remove her from the "degradation" of work once they marry.

Lucy had chosen Arthur Holmwood from the list of suitors including Jack Seward, Quincy Adams (an American), and Arthur. Now she is rethinking her decision since she has met Henry Jekyll. Jekyll treats her as an adult and intelligent individual. Where Arthur secretly envisions her settling down and becoming his wife and mother of their children, Jekyll sees her as becoming a partner in his affairs.

She and Mina have been close since childhood, sharing everything except men friends. Mina is torn over the new beau in Lucy's life, on one hand he seems much more capable of appreciating her brains, yet he is an unknown factor. He introduced Lucy and Mina to a friend of his, Drusilla. They have been doing many social things in the evenings and the nights.

Lucy will inherit CIWL from Willem. Currently there are no male heirs. She has no problems with this. In preparation for this she is training with Andrew Murray in the concepts of business. She will ask Mina to assist her as Mina is more capable as a manager of people.

/********************************************************************************************
Wilhelmina Murray - close friend of Lucy and almost daughter of Wellinghams
/********************************************************************************************

Mina is the only daughter of Andrew Murray, comptroller of CIWL and one of the founding members of the Keepers of the Doors. She has been friends with Lucy Wellingham since they were children. Mina's mother died when she was young and Anne Wellingham became her second mother. As a result she was exposed to the same schooling as Lucy. Andrew hoped his daughter would follow in his footsteps as comptroller, however her aptitude is more toward programming and project management. Once Andrew realized this he pushed her in directions that would strengthen her abilities in these fields. As a result Mina is one of the best Project Managers in the company.

Mina met Jonathan Harker at a CIWL event. Jonathan was working as a junior partner in the law firm retained by CIWL for their legal issues. They are engaged to be married when he returns from Transylvania. Recently Mina has been seeing Prince Sergei, whom she met in downtown London. She is torn between her sense of duty toward Jonathan and her infatuation/ deep passion for Prince Sergei. Only recently has she learned that Jonathan is missing in Transylvania. Prince Sergei has promised to contact people there to find out what has happened.

/********************************************************************************************
Keepers Of The Doors
/********************************************************************************************

This group of people make it their responsibility to secure any trans-dimensional gates or doors they find. So far they have secured two. One in the basement of CIWL headquarters and a second one in Istanbul under the Blue Mosque.

Lord Willem, Andrew Murray, and John Sebastion are the founders of the Keepers. They were the first three to experience a Door when they entered the one in the basement of CIWL headquarters. This Door took them to Centrys, where the came across the future chief engineer of CIWL.

Currently their are 20 members of the Keepers. Each member is responsible for monitoring world events to see if there are more Doors that need sealing.
