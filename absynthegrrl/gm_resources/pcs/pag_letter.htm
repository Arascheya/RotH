<p class="regtxt5">Pagaret,</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I know we didn't part on the best of terms. It's been four years and I still see you backing away from us. There are some things I need to say that I should have said long ago and at a better time. I was a total bitch and I know it. I envied you so much when we were young. Mom spent so much time with you because, well, because you were more capable than Sellos or I and it hurt. I know I can't make it up to you, all the nasty stuff that went down, but I want to say I am sorry for what I did to you. I know it's too little, too late, but I still need to tell you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had hoped to see you, to tell you to your face, but you had already gone and I got scared. I left this with Alucinia, along with a few of mom's things. I found them in a trunk when I was going through the back storage areas of the wine sheds. You will know what they mean and be able to understand them better than I can.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sellos still blames you for the death of father, I don't, and I'm not sure I ever really did. It just seemed so much easier to go along with him, rather than risk his anger. He's not all bad, but recently some things have begun to trouble me. He's always wanted to be higher up the social ladder, even though we are well-respected, he wants to be part of the nobility. A few days before writing this, I found some letters he was getting ready to send. They were to several noble houses offering to broker a marriage deal between them and me. I have no desire to be a trophy bride to some house just so Sellos can move up the ladder. Right now, I'm not sure I want to be a wife at all. I wish I had your skills. I'd leave, take to the world and try to make something of myself, but I don't think I know how.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Can I ask you to meet me when you get back? (Gods, I hope you get back!) Any place, you choose the time and setting, I'll come. I want to see you and I need to ask you for a bit of help. I know, I'm calling in the one promise you gave me, but I don't know where else to turn. It was our wine that poisoned the Enelman household. I need to beg for your help in finding out how it happened. The wine was a barrel of Elrishin Reserve, you remember it, don't you? The very hearty, dark red from the Elrish family vineyard near Tzell? It was shipped on the Netershi, under one of our standard contracts, with a trustworthy crew, and it was then stored at our warehouse until delivery. Somewhere along the way it was tampered with and I need to know how and by whom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have some money put aside that I can pay you with. Sellos is concerned, but thinks we should handle it through the watch. I think they'll find an answer, but I think it might be a convenient one, rather than the real one. He certainly won't part with money to fund private investigations. He'd rather keep it for buying fancy things and going to the "right places".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Please send word directly to me if you can meet with me. If I'm not in the shop offices you can have the messenger ask for Jenezia, I still trust her and she will get the message to me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thank you,</p>
