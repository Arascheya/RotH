<p class="regtxt5">Thock Background</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You are a ranger in the service of a group of rangers living in the forests outside Shadizar. A week ago you were given instructions to find a path through the deep forest for a group of the queen’s guards. They told you little of their mission, just enough to get you pointed in the direction they wanted to go.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Three days later you came across a ruined city deep within the forest. Here the guards ordered you to wait for them. You were told to wait one day and then head back if no one came to meet you. During your day of waiting you scouted around the edges of the ruin to pass time and to look for dangers from the forest.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Near dusk you came across a strangely dress skeleton in a depression in the center of a grove of trees. The clothing looked like robes rather than armor. Near its left hand was an oblong shaped box with a black snake-like tail coming out one end. The mouth of the serpent was filled with pointed little gold teeth, each tooth pointing out from the back of the snake’s mouth. It must have been dead as it did not move when you poked at it. The oblong box had rotting leather straps on it that might have at one time attached to the skeleton’s arm. Carefully turning it over you saw an intricate clasp holding a lid down on it. It seemed to be frozen shut, you could not get it to open with the gentle pressure you tried. Worried about damaging it or springing a hidden trap you placed it in your pack and looked at the skeleton once more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">On its right hand you found a ring with a dragon head worked into it. Carefully you separated it from the skeleton and examined it more closely. It was exquisitely detailed with fine black hair for a crest, a small rainbow diamond formed an orb which it clutched in its paws, tiny specs of green diamond formed its eyes. Red enamel gave the head and paws their red color. The band was white gold.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You picked this up as well and placed it in your pouch. As you arrived back at the meeting place you could see two of the guards returning from the ruins. White faced and shaking they related that traps and terrors had killed the other ten men. Hastily you packed and left, returning to Shadizar.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You were in the middle of relating this story to your friends at your favorite watering hole when the bright light and twisting, gut tearing sensation over-came you. As it faded you saw this seem to scroll across your vision as you awoke to Verkal and Heron’s torch:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">(you aren’t sure which is more startling - the vision itself, or the fact you would know how to speak this to someone should you desire to)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Addendum:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Note:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You will see two separate spellings of the word 'magic'. These are:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Majik = things Arcane or of the Arcane arts</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Magic = things of priestly or god given powers and spells</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shadizar in your time is the capitol of the nation of Zamora. There are two other major cities nearby, Larsha to the south and Arenjun to the east. Larsha is a farming herding city and Arenjun is near the mines in the Kezanki Mountains.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is the tenth year of the rule of Queen Taramis. She is not the compassionate ruler her father King Ozric was, but she is not needlessly cruel. It is said she is also a sorcerer of great power. The mission you were sent out on was a quest for the fabled ruins of Skelos, city of sorcerers. Here the queen hoped to find the Scrolls of Skelos, treatises of great majikal power. You are not sure if the two survivors found them or not.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">During your youth you were taught enough of the reading and writing of sounds to piece together some of the writings found at the edges of the ruins you happened across. They lead you to believe the city was Skelos.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Asking your friends and acquaintances in Shadizar you learned a bit about Skelos. In antiquity it was a place of Arcane learning and power. It was said there was a Well there that allowed the passage to strange and wondrous new lands. Then one day evil emerged from the Well and brought about a conflict that destroyed the city and the arcane school it was known for. The forest swallowed up the ruins until it was once again seen by your group.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shadizar is a bustling city of many different trades, truly the meeting place of Zamora. Few parts of it remain empty for long. Even the Tower of Set, robbed, then pillaged, in the last days of King Ozric has been reclaimed by the priests of Yama, God of Death.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To the west of the city lie the great forests bordering on Corinthia, to the east are the plains where the local herds roam. Further to the east are the dry steppes of the Kezanki Mountains.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Summers are warm and relatively dry, winters are cold but fairly short. Snow lasts three months at the worst. The sky is a bright blue with a single moon at night.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In the new place where you are now you have noticed the sky has more of a purple color than the one you grew up with. Also the daylight is not quite the same color either.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hello, my name is Tatyana Zerina Merilen Cheryenko Petrovka, Tyana to my friends.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I came to heal you, yet I find it is not necessary. Something you are linked to has already begun the process. What manner of magic is this? It is not something I am familiar with, unless... but no, it couldn't be...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Your friend comes for you. I will keep watch until he arrives.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I shall do what I can to help you through this simulation. I cannot end it. The Watcher in his Web must be appeased and I dare not cross him directly.</p>
