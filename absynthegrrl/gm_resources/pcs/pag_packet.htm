<p class="pagecaption">Pagaret Packet of Materials from Sister</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sketches of various areas of the places hidden and lost. Some are abandoned rooms, others are tunnels, and a few are various caves. One in particular catches your eye. It shows a large space, roughly octagonal, with spider webs carved into the walls and floor. Small stalactites and stalagmites reach toward the floor and ceiling. A large stone altar crouches in front of a half spider, half woman statue. Large fire bowls rest on the backs of stone spiders near the altar. In the center of the floor is a large stone plug with arcane symbols carved into it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is also a small brass key with an intricate pattern of teeth and a crouching jade tiger pendant on a gold chain. Wrapped around the tiger is a small note with the following on it.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Pag,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">As you know, you are my heir. I had hoped to show you some of the most thoroughly hidden secrets of Miskaton before my demise. If you are reading this, I was not able to do so. I don't know what I found, but it is after me and I'm not sure I can survive.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Take the pendent to Yashyra at the Failed Mage Tavern. Tell her to let you into the vault where she let me store some items. This key will open the stone panel behind which I hid them.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Do not be afraid of adventure. It is better to die than to remain locked into convention and normalcy. That was the one point your father and I never quite agreed on.</p>
