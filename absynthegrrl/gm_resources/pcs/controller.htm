<p class="pagecaption">Notes to the New Controller</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I don't know what to say about the proxy gods, but they prompt my actions. Many theories abound, but even we three don't understand how they came to be. Some of their essence seems to be psychic bleed from the imprisoned Creator and Destructor, other pieces seem to be based on the worst and best of the beings worshipping them. One thing is certain, however, each one seeks the dominance of its point of view and the diminshing or destruction of all others.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have recruited you to be a proxy of mine, with several differences from the standard proxy arrangement. I do not expect, nor will accept, any form of worship. There is no "holy book" of answers for you to turn to. I have no care if you are devoutly religious or an atheist. You are expected to make your own decisions. I only ask that you do so with compassion and consideration. All actions have consequences.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The task is to keep the balance. To create order where chaos dominates, to introduce chaos where order dominates, to keep good from becoming so powerful that great evil must come into being to oppose it. Do not act hastily. Take time to consider and observe, to listen and watch. Sometimes the key to the puzzle is revealed in a casual word or image.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wish I had time to give you all the information you will need for this task, however, the knowledge would fill a library and take life times to impart. Such a library is one of the many rooms available to you inside this magical construct which will be your home. This construct is large, comprising over 70 rooms, although some are merely connecting items. But I digress. To save you a bit of confusion, there are only four truly important areas. These are the Library, the Throne Room, the Core Systems, and the Interface.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You may reach the Library by descending the stairway to your courtyard and taking the first door on your right. When you enter the library, ask Kyira, the librarian, for the suggested first volumes. There are five of them, titled as follows: Magical Theory; Gate Theory; Gods, Goddesses, and the rest; Hut Concepts; and A Quick History of the World. They are not nearly enough to tell you all that is happening, but they will give you a fighting chance at knowing what to ask. The realms are vast and we are but one among the multitudes. It is not possible to be all places at all times. The slice of the realms you experience will be different than the ones I have seen. Take heart that your contributions will always effect those around you and may change the very fabric of the realms you touch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kyira has agreed to stay in the Hut to assist you in finding other volumes that might be of assistance. I would take it as a great kindness if you treat her with respect. If you do not, she is under no obligation to remain and you will need to find items in the library for yourself, rather than being able to ask her for them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Throne Room is the main control center for this construct. From here you can move the Hut through space and time to the areas needing your attention. The recommended reading list will give you some idea about what this means. This room is accessed by descending your stairwell to the first landing, entering the sitting room, and taking the door to your left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Core Systems are accessed through a hidden door behind the rear head to the right of your throne. This is the heart of the Hut, providing the ability to move through time and space and the power required to keep the Hut alive.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Interface is the exit to the Real-Space Realms and is the only way in or out of the Hut. The door at the end of the Throne Room leads to the interface room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once again, I apologize for not being able to provide you with more assistance in this initial transition, however, events are unfolding far more quickly than I expected and I must rush to meet them. The last advice I can give is watch everything and pay attention to anything you hear. Sometimes the smallest statement carries the biggest impact. Good luck and be careful.</p>
