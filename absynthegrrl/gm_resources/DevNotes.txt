captain starts concious long enough to say:

visions, gates, demons, 

he searches for the Eye of the Destructor

<more ramblings>

a hut and a blade, Soul Eater, something about a hut and this blade

Ideas:
touching Soul Eater to a GateKeeper gem without a gem attached will destroy
the GateKeeper spirit
Soul Eater - heart as target is good, brain is better

Planescape - place Hann, Artificer to the Gods, in the Outlands where the
tsr artificer currently is

World Gates and Hyperdrives create the equivalent of vapor trails across the
ethereal - these are echoes of the transdimensional aspects of these travel
mechanisms
/* work out better details of how techno gates/dimensions and majikal plains
and such tie together */

ethereal to astral - passing through a gap doesn't always punt one out of
current space - it will spit one out into a random place in the astral plain
if certain majiks are in effect at the time of transition
/* develop this concept further */
