<p class="pagecaption">Hunters</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Collective of hunters owes its origina to the first group of pharaoh's guards the assisted Imhotep in his search for Angelique's creator and her progeny. Through the ceturies they have tracked and killed numerous vampyr and the occasional other non-human they have encountered. As time has progressed they have evolved into a complex organization with researchers, trainers, administrators, and actual hunters.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They are aware of the <a href="prague_cabal.htm">Cabal of Prague</a> and have been seeking them for years now.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To many their mission to destroy non-human intelligences could be seen as good, however, the Prague Cabal has kept the violence and bloodshed down in the regions where they have influence. If the Hunters were to actually succeed, the world would rapidly become much more violent.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In 1890's London council members include such varied persons as Bram Stoker, Abraham von Helsing, and several other well placed British citizens. <a href="../npcs/slayer.htm">Princess Maria</a> is a Hunter and her father is one of the higher level administrators for the Eastern European section of the group.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Hunters seek knowledge of the <a href="../npcs/iskandera.htm">Origin</a>, similar to the way the vampyr do. However the Hunters believe the Origin would unite the vampyr and then subjugate the living as food and slaves. The greatest dream of a Hunter is to destroy the Origin.</p>
