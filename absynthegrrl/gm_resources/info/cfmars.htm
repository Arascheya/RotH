<p class="pagecaption">Conflict for Mars</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Conflict for Mars is the flag-ship MMO for <a href="cycore.htm">CyCore Games</a>. It is a combat and tactics game played on various play fields that simulate combat to take control of various Mars locations. It started small, with the combat to determine ownership of the capital city, Magratha, and government facilities.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It became so popular that several expansion packages were added over the years.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Clan Holds was the first expansion. It was designed with the help of the four elder clans, those formed from the beta testers and early players of the game. Shan and Talia's clan, the Plaizaar Regiment, is one of these elder clans. This expansion added the training grounds and clan strongholds to the game. The training areas were set up to allow invitation combat between clans and to allow training runs between different clan groups. Solo play options were also added, with stealth, assassination, one on one combat, and theft scenarios supported. Motion capture for custom avatars was offered to any of the clan members that participated in all phases of the expansion package creation.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Free Cities was the second expansion. It added additional cityscapes and expanded combat into capture and hold, capture the flag, and other improved tactical scenarios.</p>
