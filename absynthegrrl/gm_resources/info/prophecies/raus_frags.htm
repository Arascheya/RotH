<p class="pagecaption">Raus Fragments of Documents</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The first time I had dealings with Natasha and her Aunt, Tasha had stolen a magical box from Duke Raus inside the box were fragments of parchements with messages on them.  The Duke was kind enough to have let me make copies of them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Foulness came from the realms of the Well and stole my daughter</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Prayers to the Goddess reveal that I must seek the foulness through the Well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After following the high ritual of the goddess I take up the <a href="../../items/well_items.htm">Holy Relics</a> and enter the Well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Across the Rift of Fire shafts, past the Sacred Offices of High Admin I look into the Glasses of Truth knowing the servants of the Goddess will read the faith in my soul.  The portals swing wide revealing the Hall of Doors.  Passing through the seven doors I come to the Hall of Silent Sentries which enfold the Shere of Infinities, the Heart of the Well.  I step to the gateway and in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Instantly the cool voice of the Goddess speaks the litany.  I concentrate on the foulness that has my daughter as the litany soothes me.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Heathens come swearing evil comes from the Well.  I am sealing the Sacred Gates and dispersing the relics.  May Jezel and the others live to restore the temple when the madness has passed.</p>
