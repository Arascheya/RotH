<p class="pagecaption">Prophecy of the Conflict</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The capture of the priestess of the High One kindled his wrath. The conflict continued for 7 days until the Evil One was imprisoned in a place capable of containing and reducing her powers.  Her priest was blasted away and the Orbs of Law scattered by the end of the conflict.  It is said another priest of the Evil One shall arise and seek to free the Evil One from her prison.  A great dark time shall fall upon the world.  At this time shall the Orbs of Law be once again findable by a priestess of the High One.  She and a band of righteous shall destroy the evil priest and cast forth the Evil One. The Chosen One shall have the holy flower of the High One upon her breast and shall be born of a strong and true peoples.  Great shall be her praise for she shall be the savior of the world.</p>
