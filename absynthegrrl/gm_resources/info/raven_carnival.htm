<p class="sectioncaption">Prelude to Coming Events</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outside, the sun shone brightly. The scullery maid called Blasse remained indoors where no one could see her, where no one would ridicule her ghostly skin and pinkish eves. She tried to focus on her work in the cellar, but all day, she had suffered from a curious sense of anticipation, a feeling that something momentous was about to occur.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Then the door creaked open, and Blasse turned to see who had invaded her peace. A dark stranger stepped into the room. At once, Blasse felt enrapt; the man was simply the most beautiful creature she had ever seen, and meeting his depthless gaze stole her breath away. The gentleman offered her a hand and helped Blasse to her feet. "Why is it," he said softly, "that when others look at you they do not see what I see? Why do they shun you, when I wish only to become lost in your beauty?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He ran a hand through Blasse's snowy hair; his touch was electric, and his voice left her spellbound. "Your beauty blinds me," he continued, leaning in closer. "And I can make it so that all the others see your beauty just as brightly. I can make you the object of all men's desire, and the envy of all women. Do you want to be what I can make you? Do you want to be what we can become together? All you must do is say. . . yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A wave of desire welled up from Blasse's heart, pushing the word to her lips, but before she could speak, a sudden draft rushed through the door, and a square of parchment drifted into the room. The paper landed before Blasse's feet. As she glanced down upon it, she felt a strange attraction, for the paper's magic affected her even more strongly than the man's.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The parchment was a handbill decorated with strange, swirling designs. Blasse began to see images in the colored patterns: unnatural beasts, distorted figures, exotic and unearthly delights . . . and there was a word, too, but she could not read it. She knelt to pick up the paper.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What does this mean?" she whispered, unable to look away from the handbill, even though she tried.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The visitor let out a low growl. "It means the Carnival is coming," he replied. He chuckled darkly. "A little piece of hell, on wheels."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">But Blasse did not hear him. When, at last, she looked up from the curious paper, the man was gone.She lifted her hand to her cheek, the skin was still warm from his touch.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Presentation</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It begins with a tingle of anticipation, a sense of dread or hope, but nothing more. </p>

<p class="regtxt5">Out of the blue, the residents of a village sense that someone, or something, soon will enter their lives. Then the handbills appear-erie, teasing flyers, promising that the Carnival is near. By the next mom, the painted wagons will be rolling into town.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To those who flock to its spectacle, the Carnival is a traveling freak show that offers a "safe" glimpse of the abnormal and the unnatural. For once in their lives, and for just a copper or two, common folk can stand in the light of day and examine the bogeymen that haunt their nightmares. But the Carnival is much more than a simple sideshow, and its performers are more than mere freaks on display. Under the protection of its mistress, Isolde, the Carnival offers refuge to those rejected by the world. Often, it comes to the aid of those who simply need to disappear, secreting them away into the Mists.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Freak show or haven, monsters or allies-it's all a matter of perspective. This accessory offers an in-depth look at the Carnival, introduces its people, and exposes a phenomenon called the Twisting, which can change the lives of those who travel with the troupe forever.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The text is presented as a guided tour. Each chapter has its own narrator: a Carny barker, then a fortuneteller, and finally a scheming professor who manages the Carnival's "Hall of Horrors." Their audience is an Outsider-someone who comes to the Carnival seeking refuge. The narrators hold differing views, and each tells his or her own version of the truth as they liff the curtain on Carnival Secrets. While they may lie or mislead, don't despair; as the Dungeon Master (DM), you'll be privy to the underlying facts. In fact, the last page of this book reveals the greatest secret of all: who is the woman who leads the Carnival. The players, however, should be left to figure things out for themselves.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After the heroes in your campaign have had some experience with the Carnival (perhaps after you've run the adventures in the Appendix), you may decide to let your players read some of this book. After all, the audience for the narrated tour is someone just like the heroes. Even if you don't share this text, however, the format is designed with a purpose: It provides a useful tool for your own role-playing, showing how three prominent members of the Carnival would interact with "Georges"-newcomers to the circle of freaks.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Tindal at Your Service</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Welcome, one! Welcome, all! Welcome to the short, and welcome to the tall! Welcome angels, welcome fiends, welcome to all from walks between! Welcome to the Carnival!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Step right up and lay your eyes on our menagerie of the macabre, our gathering of the grotesque, our collection of the curious, our festival of freaks! For a mere pair of copper coins, you can behold wonders beyond your wildest dreams and niqhunares. Yes. that's riqht, folks-just two thin copperLbuys you a ticket to thrills and chilling revelations. Step riqht this way and throuqh the first curtain!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">But not you, Stranger. You stay here with me. I'm told that our gentle giant, Hermos, sent you my, way. Seems you'd like to disappear for a little while. Out of curiositv. what's your trouble? Try to plant a stake in the wrong fellow's heart, or are you just running out on some burgomeister's daughter? On second thought, just keep it to yourself. We don't care what you're running from, so long as you don't drag it here to our doorstep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I'm inside out when I say your visit could be more timely; I'm supposed to be running herd on all those new Georges, not just you. But another barker will have to walk the talk today. You look puzzled. stranger. Quite right-I'll bet you're having a little trouble following my words Get used to it. "Inside out" just means honest." I'll give you that one for free. But don't expect too many more favors, because nothing comes free at the Carnival.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You see, we Troupers just love talking over the heads of you Georges. I must be feeling generous, because here's another one for free: Georges. That means anyone who's not with the Carnival. You'll hear a lot of words like that one. No one's ever going to sit you down and teach you what they mean, but don't worry; you'll pick up the lingo soon enough.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As you wander around, you'll hear some of your fellow Georges use words like "freak" when they're talking about Troupers. 1'11 warn vou right now to leave that kind of talk behind if you want to come with us. "Freak" is a very special word, my friend, and you haven't earned the right to use it. Yes, it's true I use it myself. All the Troupers do, but it's different when we say it. When it comes from our lips, we're just saying we aren't like you Georges. I've never heard a George say "freak" who wasn't casting an insult, calling someone a monster. And most Troupers have heard more than a lifetime's worth of that kind of bile. so if you label someone here a monster, George, you'd sure better mean it, because You're going to have to defend yourself. Are we clear?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tell you what, George. Let's make a game of our little encounter. We'll call it "How Long is Your Life?" Here, pick a card, any card, and put it back in the deck. If I can guess which card you picked, I promise we'll get you out of these parts, safe and sound. If I can't quess your card, we'll leave you here to face whatever fiend or foe has you running. Sound fun? Sound fair? Well, I think so!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hmm. Your card is , . . the Ace of Bones? Of course! You can breathe again, George, there was no chance of my getting it wrong. Just a little puckery at your expense. Oh, don't worry; all my magic tricks are done with smoke and mirrors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Welcome to the Carnival, George. You can call me Tindal. I'm the main barker for our acts. at least those who could use a little extra drama. Oh, there's Professor Pacali over there past that big tent. He's the barker for all the real freaks, but he and his cronies are bit skurry, if you ask me. Just stick near me and vou'll do ail right. .</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It's my job to take the Georges' coppers and make sure they keep their greasy little hands to themselves. With my silvered tongue, I bring it all to life for them. I herd each group of Georges around the big ring, and generally show off about ten of our acts before I drop them off at the Hall of Horrors for the big squeeze. The Hall of Horrors - now that's Pacali's crew.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tell you what, since it looks like vou might be staying with us awhile, I'll treat you to a grand tour just for one! It's a wonderful world we've made for ourselves in the Carnival. We have delights for all of the senses! Walk with me now, soak it all in. It'll do wonders for your spirits, George.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Isolde</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So, you're still wondering who Isolde really is. She has never come right out and confessed, and none of us risk asking. One should never pry into the private affairs of a lady, I like to say. Still, a man can't help but wonder.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Without a doubt, she's our guardian angel, but don't make a fool of yourself by taking this notion too literally. The Skurra may hold precisely that opinion, but I don't buy into it. They're just picking at the same crumbs as all the rest of us and making their best guess.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As a human possessing magical power, I like to frame Isolde along similar lines. Don't get me wrong. She's not just some mercenary with an enchanted sword-she's much more than that! But I'd wager my last two coppers she's flesh and blood, just like us. Well, just like me, at any rate. I don't know YOU too well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I will concede this: The story I want to be true, even if I can't entirely surrender to it, is the version Hermos tells his friends. Apparently, not long after Isolde first joined the Carnival, Hermos walked right up to her and directly asked why she'd come to protect the Troupers. Her response was quite fascinating: She said she hadn't simply "come." She'd been-"willingly sent." Never again has she been as candid or as talkative as she was that day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hermos has always been fond of spouting little spiritual lessons, and he has spun Isolde's simple statement into quite the poignant fable, bless his ox-sized heart. According to the original Troupers of the Carnival 1' Morai, Hermos once had a friend named Marie. She was also part of the Puppet Show. In fact, it was she who told Hermos to lead the other Troupers to freedom, and then she stayed behind, surrendering her life to keep the Puppetmaster from pursuing the fugitives.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hermos told me, as he tells everyone eventually, that he believes his old friend Marie sent Isolde. After Marie died, he claims, she found Isolde in the land of the dead and sent her back to watch over Hermos and his friends. So now we have Isolde as a ghostly guardian sent by the dearly departed. Gets you right here, doesn't it?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Of course, I know there's more to Isolde then playing shepherd to our flock. I've already mentioned the bit about how we travel-following a random yet highly fortuitous path-and how at any moment Isolde might tell everyone it's time to pull stakes and move on. Sometimes when she gives that order, it feels as if she's avoiding something, as if the Carnival is on the run. But I've also seen the glint of a predator in her eyes, and sometimes when Isolde declares it's time to go, I think she's on the hunt. But hunting who? And why? Maybe whoever it is that keeps posting those flyers; beyond that, I don't dare to guess.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Forgive my amusement over Hermos's fable, but I'm confident that, no matter why Isolde was "willingly sent" here. it wasn't just to protect a bunch of freaks. Nonetheless, she does seem to find that task as worthy as whatever she's really here to do, and we bless her for it!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some of Pacali's crew seem to blame Isolde for Twisting. I don't quite agree with their thinking. but it is strange that she herself isn't affected. At least if she is affected in some way, nobody can guess what it is. Once you see her, you'll know what I mean, she's that beautiful. But if the Twisting affects everything, even animals, even flowers, why would it leave Isolde untouched?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It's a question we Troupers ask each other all the time. Most of us agree that the Twisting manifests one's inner flaws and foibles physically, so more than a few Troupers believe that Isolde simply has no inner flaws! They believe her heart is so pure that the Twisting can't get its hooks into her: she offers it no failings to warp.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some of the others think Isolde herself is actually the source of the Twisting. As they put it, this is her form of justice. You might think that the Twisting is a horror, that it turns men into monsters; most of us don't see it that way. Men are already the very worst kind of monsters, George. Out there, in your world, true evils lurk in innocent guises, hiding their blackened and venomous hearts behind pretty faces and pleasing smiles. Here in the Carnival, Isolde has made everyone equal, and made everyone honest. If you have evil in your heart, it will show in your face. Be a monster on the inside, be made a monster on the outside.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hrmm? That's right, Hermos's ghost story is another likely explanation. We've never tested it, but it does seem that Isolde would be immune to the Twisting if she were a spirit. and thus had no flesh to twist. The same theory goes for the Skurra, if you believe it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">What do I think? That's clever, George. You're right, I don't believe any of those stories. My best guess? I'd wager that Isolde has been affected by the Twisting, but she's hidden it somehow. Honestly, have you ever seen anyone as perfect as she? Perhaps, just perhaps, the Isolde everyone knows so well isn't the real her-just some powerful illusion. . .</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Chapter 2</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Madame Fortuna</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Greetings, giorgio. Sit here, before me. There is no time to find somewhere else to stay. The Carnival must move on, and if you leave this vardo you surely will be left behind. Even now, the Mists arise to hide our passing; do you not see them licking at the windowpane?</p>
