<p class="pagecaption">Keepers Of The Doors</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This group of people make it their responsability to secure any trans-dimensional gates or doors they find. So far they have secured two. One in the basement of CIWL headquarters and a second one in Istanbul under the Blue Mosque.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lord Willem, Andrew Murray, and John Sebastion are the founders of the Keepers. They were the first three to experience a Door when they entered the one in the basement of CIWL headquarters. This Door took them to Centrys, where the came across the future chief engineer of CIWL.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A third Door exists in a short passage at the base of the Sphynx. This one has not been found since the Sphynx is still mostly buried in the sand. There are four more Doors world wide that need to be placed. If Crowlen gets his way there will also be seven new Doors formed into the Cthulian dimension when he powers up Stonehenge.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Currently their are 40 members of the Keepers. Each member is responsable for monitoring world events to see if there are more Doors that need sealing. So far they are unaware of the Law of Sevens around Gates and Doors. Stonehenge is a power nexus that can easily be opened to form a Hell Gate. Once this Gate opens, six more will appear world-wide to balance the Law of Sevens.</p>
