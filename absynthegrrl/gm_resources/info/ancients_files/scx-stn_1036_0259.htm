<p class="sectioncaption">Report 1 energy anomaly theories:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Theories based on readings and information sent to several theoretical mathematicians and physicists have been proposed. The consensus is that the energy anomaly is a portal into a type of "space" similar to, but not quite the same as, the N-dimensional space accessed by our hyperdrive units.  The theory further states that with proper computers and equipment travel through this space should be possible.  Several theoreticians are on the way here to experiment with these possibilities.</p>
