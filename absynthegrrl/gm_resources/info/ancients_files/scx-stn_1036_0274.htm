<p class="sectioncaption">Report 2 energy anomaly experiments:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Working from previous results and theories a second prototype has been built.  This time the volunteer, Valerna Tolstyevska, was able to wear the unit on her back and walk into the Well.  She entered the Well at 0500 hours.  Again instruments have been continuously monitoring the Well during this attempt.  Readings indicate a significant variation in the energy field structure at times when the controller was active.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All readings are in file SCX-STN 1036.0274/1AINC.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At 1700 hours Valerna emerged from the Well and collapsed from exhaustion.  Before her collapse she was able to verify function of the control device.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A preliminary medical report is included in file
SCX-STN 1036.0274/2MED-INC.</p>
