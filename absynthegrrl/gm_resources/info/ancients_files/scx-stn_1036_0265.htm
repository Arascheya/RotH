<p class="sectioncaption">Report 1 energy anomaly experiments:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Working from information provided by the physicists our engineering shop produced a prototype "controller" for attempting travel in the energy anomaly space.  The unit is a stripped down ship nav computer and a modified hyperdrive unit attached to a heavy cargo vehicle chassis. Marterick Serkoff volunteered to pilot this device when it was lowered into the energy field. Tests began at 0500 hours.

<p class="regtxt5">Instrument readings taken during all phases of the experiment are recorded in file: SCX-STN 1036.0048/1AINC.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At 1800 hours Marterick walked from the energy anomaly, shaking with reaction and fatigue. There was no sign of the test equipment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The researchers are starting to call this thing the Well for some unclear reason, but since that is easier to say and input the rest of us will refer to it as the Well also.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marterick will be fully debriefed tomorrow after he has rested but he gave a brief sketch of what happened shortly after his return.  It is included below.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I entered the bubble and felt a wrenching and disorientation lasting about 1 second followed by a tranquil floating sensation, accompanied by an intense clarity of perception.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I then attempted to move using the transport and promptly felt the twisting and disorientation once more.  When my vision cleared I was on a grassy plain just past a line of trees.  About 0.1 zeems away a group of humanoids dressed in skins were killing a large furry elephant-like creature.  When they caught sight of me they immediately came to investigate and, treating me with a mixture of fear and homage, pulled me out of the transport and took me to their camp.  All this time I was attempting to use the controller and leave, to no avail.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They attempted to communicate with grunts and gestures and when that failed they offered me food and one of their women.  I ate the food and tried to ignore the woman.  This brought many hostile gestures and grunts so they assigned a small group of men to watch me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Much later at night I was able to slip away from them and make a run for the controller but they saw me when I was still very near the camp.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When I managed to avoid them and get back to the controller it still did not seem to work.  While I was frantically trying to figure out how to get back I suddenly felt the twisting again and shortly there after emerged back here at the research station.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The research team is preparing another device.</p>
