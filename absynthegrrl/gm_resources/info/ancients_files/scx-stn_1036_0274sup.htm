<p class="sectioncaption">Report 2A energy anomaly experiments:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valerna debriefing:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The sensations I felt were identical to those of Marterick only I emerged in a small field behind a cluster of buildings.  As I ventured closer several humanoid beings emerged from one of the larger buildings and approached cautiously.  The were carrying pitchforks and rakes in defensive type positions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I am not sure why but when they came close enough I was mostly able to understand what they were saying.  When I spoke to them quietly and peacefully they lowered their "weapons" and cautiously approached.  When they saw the control panel strapped to my wrist they again began to draw back.  Quickly I managed to convince them it was just a form of jewelry and they were at ease again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They invited me into their house and fed me.  While we were talking a man in black floor length dress-like affair, wearing a flat brimmed black hat, came to the door.  My hosts treated this man with incredible deference and respect.  He seemed friendly enough until he saw me.  At which point he began a tirade about heretics, witches, and associating with demons.  All my hosts turned white and began to protest, even following after the person as he left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The few who remained immediately shoved me toward the back door and told me to start running, that maybe they wouldn't be able to catch me if I ran fast enough.  As I was nearing the woods across their fields, a group of warrior types arrived and began rounding up my hosts. Feeling that this was all my fault I went back to try and help.  When I came up to the group I was forcibly grabbed and placed under arrest.  I was able to get the others released only if I agreed to "remove my demonic influence" from them and agreed to either "recant" and accept someone or something called the "sacrament of the blessed Christ" or stand trial as a witch.  When I asked them what they were talking about I was poked with one of their swords and told to come along.  When we were out of sight of the buildings I activated the controller and left. Unfortunately the controller had been bumped during my arrest and I did not emerge back here.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Instead I emerged in a dark, dank cellar or passageway.  I felt my way along the wall until I found a stairwell leading up.  I followed it up quite a ways, occasionally hearing moans and calls for help drifting in from several landings on my right.  I finally emerged near some type of guard post.  Fortunately I saw the three of them before they saw me. Each was dressed in hardened leather and was wearing a large sword.  In the half-light that filtered into where I was standing I opened the control panel and began looking for loose wires or anything to tell me why I wasn't where I wanted to be.  Just as I found a loose wire one of them saw me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Knowing they would know the tunnels better than I, I attempted to dive past them into the lighted tunnels.  The one who was still nearest the far opening swept my feet out from under me and made a lunge for me.  He only managed to grab a fist full of hair before I was up and running.  The chase went on forever, or so it seemed. They were hampered by their armor and I was hampered by the controller.  How many stairwells I scrambled up before I found a doorway I could dodge into I don't know.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gasping for breath I dodged through the door and slammed it behind me.  It was then I noticed the frightened young woman watching my every move.  Since she wasn't moving I finished fixing the controller and tried again.  This time I emerged here.</p>
