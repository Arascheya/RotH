<p class="pagecaption">Core Tap Energy Sources</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A tapping device is a thermal to electric converter placed deep in the crust, near the crust lithosphere boundary, for maximum heat absorption. The electricity produced is sent back up through the sealed shaft to a set of converters and regulators that condition it for facility power. The actual tapping shaft is still the most vulnerable part of the system. The taps are either set apart from the facilities they feed or heavily baffled in case of a leak. In this case the tap is set below and off to the side of the main complex. The conditioning area is about 500 feet below the lowest level of the main facility.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">On Karanal the core tap provides energy to all of the facility except the gate and its control computer. These are powered by an antimatter tapping portal constructed mid way between Karanal and its sun. this satellite power system feeds energy in a tight beam back to a network of geo-sync satellites that then direct it to receptors on the ground. This satellite was also the source for the power for Elentaryn’s shield system. The shield system was composed of a field radiator on the tapping satellite and an array of control satellites located near the system perimeter. These controllers were additions to the warning/defense satellites already in place there. The first shield tests activated the field generators and something in the resulting field energy damaged the control systems. The command to shut down was interpreted as a restart using programmed ramp up of field generation. Ramp up was programmed as a series of field energy pulses moving up to a sustained field generation once the shield was stabilized.</p>
