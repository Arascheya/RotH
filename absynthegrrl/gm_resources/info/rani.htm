<p class="pagecaption">Rani Corp</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mega-corp of the Realms of the Hut Online story-verse. Founded by <A href="../npcs/vashi_r.htm">Vashi Kala Dechen Ristan</a> after discovering the old Zeltropian post-crash complex. She has grown the business using tech from the complex and is now using the company as a way to influence world events and assemble a team to explore space and beyond.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rani Corp has many sub-sections, however, she has worked hard to ensure cooperation across units in all phases of the business. The company can respond faster than similar corporate behemoths as a result of her efforts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rani corp is a "humane" corp. Employee safety and well-being are top priority, higher than profit goals. In a conflict, employee relations will win out over other concerns except in absolutely dire financial situations. The corp has grown and diversified in enough ways that it would be very hard to cause financial hardship to the corp. It has remained a private corp over the years, finding ways of generating investment capital without having to open itself to stock holders and boards of directors. <A href="../npcs/vashi_r.htm">Vashi</a> is adamant that this situation never be changed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rani HQ is located in Mt. Jhomolhari at the Lhasaha/Nehtan border - Jhomolhari (Chomo Lhari) mtn - located in Nehtan at the Nehtan/Lhasaha border - 23,996 ft high. In its foreground are the ruins of a fortress built to repel Lhasahan invaders. Located within the mountain is the Rani Group hq.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rani Corp has a "Don't Be Evil" policy, however, Vashi firmly enforces it. Several up and coming individuals were removed from the corp for violating the spirit of the rule. Vashi is very strict on spirit of the law over letter of the law. Even the most severe Rani Corp detractors cannot point to ethics violations or bad behavior on the part of Rani Corp.</p>

</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Corporate Management Philosophy</p>

<p class="regtxt5">from a lecture Vashi gave at a global business seminar:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Many corps use surveys, preformance reviews, and other paper to try and inspire loyalty, teamwork, and responsability. In my experience, this is bullshit. You inspire loyalty by knowing and respecting your employees through personal contact, genuine interest, and honest dealings. If someone is not performing at a desired level, talk to them. No amount of on paper crap will do shit, except cover your ass in some of the courts. Want to know how the company internals are doing? Stroll the halls of your groups and sit down for a few minutes with each member of your team. This is how we keep our competitive edge. We are able to enact rapid change because we talk to each other with honesty and concern. Memos, forms, and reports have their place, but it is not in determining the health of my company.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Another thing, corporations tend to double down on process and protocols when they are doing badly. This is the exact wrong thing to do. Adding layers of "accountability" and procedure slow an already crippled system even more. The only solution to corporate flailing is to increase inovation, encourage out of the box ideas, and to try many different things. The solution to poor quality is not a "quality office" but finding ways to increase employee involvement and interest. Find ways that help your employees want to produce the best damn thing they can, not coast through the corporate culture for pay and retirement. Don't be afraid to shuffle things around and shake up the ways you do things. If you take one thing from this, do not ever increase the number of "accountability tracking groups", they are nothing more than creativity sucks and a burden to your corporation as a whole. Innovation, quality, and productivity come from the people actually doing the work, not from people watching them do it or trying to quantify how they do it.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A final thought. Do not consider yourself to be the pinnacle of your technology, service, or product, even if you are. As soon as you believe this, you become complacent. You loose your drive to be better, to grab the next great thing and bring it into being. Always think of yourself as trying to become number one. Make the journey the goal and you will stay fresh.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Management is viewed as helping the regular workers get things done in a coordiniated way. Managers are promoted in the usual way, through recognition of good performance. Managers are held to a high standard, including the ability to communicate effectively with their reports, with peer level managers, and with higher levels. They are expected to inspire their groups. Failure to successfully communicate with any of these levels will be grounds for the manager being moved into a different role in the company. It is not viewed as a demotion, failure, or penalty to be moved out of management. It is a recognition that not all people can successfully manage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Corporate management strategy is based on tribal and Tzani leadership - this is a concensus with leader model. The Leader breaks ties and nudges the governing council on directions and actions. The governing council is composed of the heads of the various divisions and departments of the corp.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Wages remain fairly flat across the group. disparity will not exceed 10 times from top to bottom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Management will remain as flat as possible - adding a layer of management requires approval from the  council of governors and requires much justification and study.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Profit is seen as necessary, but not the end goal. The primary goal is developing things that benefit or entertain the consumer. As a result greed in pricing structures or operational designs is not tolerated. Items and services will be priced to sustain Rani Corp, not make it fabulously wealthy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rani Corp is not in the business of building weapons. Rani Corp products can be used as desired by purchasers, however, military applications are frowned apon and egregious mis-use will result in termination of contracts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rani Corp equipment can be overridden by Rani Corp if it is employed in goals counter to Rani Corp. This is not demonstrated or mentioned until absolutely necessary. The only example so far is the Meriksas attempting to force government monitoring into Rani Corp communications networks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rani Corp will cooperate with governments in case by case warrants, but will not allow fishing, snooping, or broad spectrum scanning of their data or traffic. No government agency will be given permission to monitor any network traffic. The attempt to place moitoring systems in lines between Rani Group network node by the Meriksas government prompted additions of encryption systems to all network traffic. Keys are not available and would not be revealed to non-Rani Group personel in any case.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rani Corp is privately held and will not release its financials to anyone, regardless of type of demand or warrant.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rani Corp functions as an independent nation-state thanks to the decree of the Nehtanese prince.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">VASHI: I find myself in a quandry. I have stood at the podium and decried the companies that attempt to limit the uses of their technologies based on personal "morality" and "principle". Now I find myself in the same position. People who buy from us are placing our components in weapons of mass killing. I find this reprehensible, intolerable, and yet, do I break my moral stance and prevent these sales, or do I stand on my principles and let our products be used as the purchaser wills? I would like all of you to consider this very carefully. Do we take a stand or do we stand aside?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">ONE OF THE ORIGINALS: Maybe we stand aside, but take a stand. What if we placed override technology in place? Something we could trigger if all-out war is ever threatened? Could we dare to prevent war by shutting our tech down if world events swung that way? Would this be "ethical" under our principles?</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Primary Corporate Goals</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rani Corp was founded to utilize found technology with the intent to find, revive, and use the starship parked in the asteroid belt. Adapting and slowly filtering the found technology into the current world economy has brought very good cash returns. This in turn funds additional development until Rani Corp was able to start aquiring interesting or potentially useful groups to diversify itself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The <a href="roth.htm">Realms of the Hut game</a> was started as a way to partially screen and wake up interest in potential recruits. As the game development progressed, Rani Corp began to see hints that the game might have more reality behind it than originally believed. As these hints grow into more and more real samples of possibility the starship endeavor begins to take a back seat to gathering detail about trans-dimensional gates and alternative methods of travel.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At some point a working gate is found and an expedition ends up in the Gate Dimension. The next step is a small group ending up in Sphere and making contacts there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rani Corp could begin to funnel goods from the <a href="freetrade.htm">Free Trade Alliance</a> into the world once they establish contacts in Sphere.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Exit Strategy</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rani Corp must formulate an Exit Strategy for those personal leaving on the return project. There needs to be an orderly transition to those remaining so services and products are not disrupted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Concepts</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Use the article below as part of the ideas behind the company</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Steve Jobs Solved the Innovator's Dilemma</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In the lead up to today's release of the Steve Jobs biography, there's been an increasing stream of news surrounding its subject. As a business researcher, I was particularly interested in this recent article that referenced from his biography a list of Jobs's favorite books. There's one business book on this list, and it "deeply influenced" Jobs. That book is The Innovator's Dilemma by HBS Professor Clay Christensen.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">But what's most interesting to me isn't that The Innovator's Dilemma was on that list. It's that Jobs solved the conundrum.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">When describing his period of exile from Apple — when John Sculley took over — Steve Jobs described one fundamental root cause of Apple's problems. That was to let profitability outweigh passion: "My passion has been to build an enduring company where people were motivated to make great products. The products, not the profits, were the motivation. Sculley flipped these priorities to where the goal was to make money. It's a subtle difference, but it ends up meaning everything."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Anyone familiar with Professor Christensen's work will quickly recognize the same causal mechanism at the heart of the Innovator's Dilemma: the pursuit of profit. The best professional managers — doing all the right things and following all the best advice — lead their companies all the way to the top of their markets in that pursuit... only to fall straight off the edge of a cliff after getting there.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Which is exactly what had happened to Apple. A string of professional managers had led the company straight off the edge of that cliff. The fall had almost killed the company. It had 90 days working capital on hand when he took over — in other words, Apple was only three months away from bankruptcy.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">When he returned, Jobs completely upended the company. There were thousands of layoffs. Scores of products were killed stone dead. He knew the company had to make money to stay alive, but he transitioned the focus of Apple away from profits. Profit was viewed as necessary, but not sufficient, to justify everything Apple did. That attitude resulted in a company that looks entirely different to almost any other modern Fortune 500 company. One striking example: there's only one person Apple with responsibility for a profit and loss. The CFO. It's almost the opposite of what is taught in business school. An executive who worked at both Apple and Microsoft described the differences this way: "Microsoft tries to find pockets of unrealized revenue and then figures out what to make. Apple is just the opposite: It thinks of great products, then sells them. Prototypes and demos always come before spreadsheets."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Similarly, Apple talks a lot about its great people. But make no mistake — they are there only in service of the mission. A headhunter describes it thus: "It is a happy place in that it has true believers. People join and stay because they believe in the mission of the company." It didn't matter how great you were, if you couldn't deliver to that mission — you were out. Jobs's famous meltdowns upon his return were symptomatic of this. They might have become less frequent in recent years, but if a team couldn't deliver a great product, they got the treatment. The exec in charge of MobileMe was replaced on the spot, in front of his entire team, after a botched launch. A former Apple product manager described Apple's attitude like this: "You have the privilege of working for the company that's making the coolest products in the world. Shut up and do your job, and you might get to stay."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Everything — the business, the people — are subservient to the mission: building great products. And rather than listening to, or asking their customers what they wanted; Apple would solve problems customers didn't know they had with products they didn't even realize they wanted.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">By taking this approach, Apple bent all the rules of disruption. To disrupt yourself, for example, Professor Christensen's research would typically prescribe setting up a separate company that eventually goes on to defeat the parent. It's incredibly hard to do this successfully; Dayton Dry Goods pulled it off with Target. IBM managed to do it with the transition from mainframes to PCs, by firewalling the businesses in entirely different geographies. Either way, the number of companies that have successfully managed to do it is a very, very short list. And yet Apple's doing it to itself right now with the utmost of ease. Here's new CEO Tim Cook, on the iPad disrupting the Mac business: "Yes, I think there is some cannibalization... the iPad team works on making their product the best. Same with the Mac team." It's almost unheard of to be able to manage disruption like this.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">They can do it because Apple hasn't optimized its organization to maximize profit. Instead, it has made the creation of value for customers its priority. When you do this, the fear of cannibalization or disruption of one's self just melts away. In fact, when your mission is based around creating customer value, around creating great products, cannibalization and disruption aren't "bad things" to be avoided. They're things you actually strive for — because they let you improve the outcome for your customer.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">When I first learned about the theory of disruption, what amazed me was its predictive power; you could look into the future with impressive clarity. And yet, there was a consistent anomaly. That one dark spot on Professor Christensen's prescience was always his predictions on Apple. I had the opportunity to talk about it with him subsequently, and I remember him telling me: "There's just something different about those guys. They're freaks." Well, he was right. With the release of Jobs's biography, we now know for sure why. Jobs was profoundly influenced by the Innovator's Dilemma — he saw the company he created almost die from it. When he returned to Apple, Jobs was determined to solve it. And he did. That "subtle difference" — of flipping the priorities away from profit and back to great products — took Apple from three months away from bankruptcy, to one of the most valuable and influential companies in the world.</p>
