<p class="pagecaption">Jaranthus Experiments</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There were several instances of these conducted on Jaranthus Prime.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jaranthus Prime was used for advanced weapons systems testing. Most of the populace was military personnel and support staff. Most of the Alliance paid scant attention to the events at this facility.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This changed when the cyberware implant testing began. There were several spectacular failures. In the early versions the experiments resulted in the death of the implanted troops</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The final experiment was far worse. Implanted troops did not die. Instead they went crazy and began slaughtering their handlers and the military support staff. A handful commandeered a ship and headed toward the <a href="../places/karanal/coresys.htm">Core Systems</a>. They decimated two stations along the way and drew so much press coverage there was no way to contain the damage. This incident was the final trigger for the Cyber Wars of 3078.</p>
