<p class="pagecaption">Valen Notes on Hut things</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Here are some things I found while scanning through the Hut’s data systems. These appear to be notes Margla was working on at the time of her release. Maybe this is why they didn’t make it into the Hut Book. I don’t know if any of this will help us, but it seemed important to get it out.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soul Eater - scanning through the Hut data I came across a few references to this thing. Using it is the easiest way to create new Hell Gates. It is also one of the ways to destroy a Hell Gate and its guardian.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Gate Keepers - these are the guardians of an open Hell Gate. They are the unsettled spirit of an Arcane who has willingly been sacrificed to open the Gate. They used to be free entities until The Hand learned how to bind them to himself during the Hell Gate creation ritual. I have not found anything on this in the Hut.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Margla - our arrival</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I don’t know if this helps us any, but here is what I remember of our arrival.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was fighting against someone under me. I was holding a dagger in my hands and trying not to let her stab herself with it. Instinctively I fought her until she whispered at me, "Let go, Great Mother. You must let it end." Something in her words froze me for a second. It was long enough for her to pull the dagger into herself. As I watched in horror a pulsing red vapor swirled into the clear gem resting at the top of the dagger.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A soft voice echoed faintly in her head as life fled the woman below her. "Thank you Mother. I return to you." A flurry of images and thoughts cascaded into my mind, swirling and twisting in a mad dance.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A ghostly hand touched my shoulder briefly, just long enough for symbols to form in my head. Meaning followed quickly, "Visit me in the Halls of Pain in the City of Doors, my friend."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly I returned to consciousness as I heard you moving around. "So it wasn’t a dream," I remember asking. Then my hands moved to pick up something from the dead woman. In her hand was the Hut Key and as I picked it up I merged with the Hut. I can’t begin to describe what that feels like. Anyway, I don’t know if this helps us understand anything else, but I do know that Margla was the woman on the rug. She Who Must Never Be Named was standing over us and she asked me to visit her if I got the chance.</p>
