<p class="pagecaption">DevelStar Resource Developers Group</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Outer Systems resource development company. This is one of the two opportunistic development companies that handle most Outer Systems resource gathering. Rival of OutSystems Resource Development Company.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">DevelStar is not quite as rapacious as OutSystems but about as poor when it comes to working conditions for their employees. There is a constant corporate espionage campaign between the two companies. There are several other development corporations, but these are the biggest and baddest of the bunch.</p>
