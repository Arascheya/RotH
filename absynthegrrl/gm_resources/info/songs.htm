<p class="regtxt5">If you could read my mind love, what a tale my thoughts could tell</p>
<p class="regtxt5">just like an old time movie 'bout a ghost from a wishing well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">in a castle dark or a fortress strong with chains upon my feet</p>
<p class="regtxt5">you know that ghost is me and I will never be set free</p>
<p class="regtxt5">as long as I'm a ghost that you can't see</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">If I could read your mind love, what a tale your thoughts could tell</p>
<p class="regtxt5">just like a paperback novel, the kind that drugstores sell</p>
<p class="regtxt5">when you reach the part where the heartaches come</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the hero would be me the hero often fails</p>
<p class="regtxt5">you won't read that book again because the ending's just too hard to take</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">I'd walk away like a movie star</p>
<p class="regtxt5">who gets burned in a three way script into number two</p>
<p class="regtxt5">a movie queen to play the scene</p>
<p class="regtxt5">of bringing all the good things out in me</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but for now love I never thought I could act this way</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and I've got to say that I just don't get it</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I don't know where we went wrong</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but the feelings gone and I just can't get it back</p>

<p class="regtxt5">just like an old time movie 'bout a ghost from a wishing well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">in a castle dark or a fortress strong with chains upon my feet</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the story always ends if you read between the lines</p>
<p class="regtxt5">you'll know I'm just trying to understand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the feelings that you lack</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I never thought I could act this way</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and I've got to say that I just don't get it</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Don Quixote</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Through the woodland through the valley</p>
<p class="regtxt5">comes a horseman wild and free</p>
<p class="regtxt5">tilting at the windmills passing</p>
<p class="regtxt5">who can that brave young horseman be?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he is wild but he is mellow, he is strong but he is weak</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he is cruel but his is gentle, he is wise but he is meek</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Reaching for his saddlebag</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he takes a battered book into his hand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">standing like a prophet now</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he shouts across the ocean to the shore</p>
<p class="regtxt5">till he can shout no more:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"I have come oer moor and mountain like a hawk upon the wing</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I was once a shining knight who was the guardian of a king</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I have searched the whole world over looking for a place to sleep</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I have seen the strong survive and I have seen the lean grow weak</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the children of the earth who wake to find the table bare</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the gentry in the country riding off to take the air"</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Reaching for his saddlebag</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he takes a rusty sword into his hand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">then striking up a knightly pose</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he shouts across the ocean to the shore</p>
<p class="regtxt5">till he can shout no more:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"See the jailor with his key who locks away all trace of sin</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the judge upon the bench who tries the case as best he can</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the wise and wicked ones who feed upon life's sacred fire</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the soldier with his gun who must be dead to be admired</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the man who tips the needle, see the man who buys and sells</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the man who puts the collar on the ones who dare not tell</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the drunkard in the tavern stealing gold to make ends meet</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the youth in ghetto black condemned to life upon the street"</p
>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Reaching for his saddlebag</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he takes a tarnished cross into his hand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">standing like a preacher now</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he shouts across the ocean to the shore</p>
<p class="regtxt5">then in a blaze of tangled hooves</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he gallops off across the dusty plain</p>
<p class="regtxt5">in vain to search again for no one will hear</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Through the woodland through the valley</p>
<p class="regtxt5">comes a horseman wild and free</p>
<p class="regtxt5">tilting at the windmills passing</p>
<p class="regtxt5">who can that brave young horseman be?</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Beauty and the Beast</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Half asleep I hear a voice</p>
<p class="regtxt5">is it only in my mind</p>
<p class="regtxt5">or is it someone calling me,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">someone I've failed and left behind?</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">To work it out I let them in,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">all the good guys and the bad guys that I've been</p>
<p class="regtxt5">all the devils that disturbed me</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and the angels that defeated them somehow</p>
<p class="regtxt5">come together in me now</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Face to face I greet the cast,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">set in silence we begin</p>
<p class="regtxt5">companions in an empty room,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I taste their victory and sin</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">To work it out I let them in,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">all the good guys and the bad guys that I've been</p>
<p class="regtxt5">all the devils that disturbed me</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and the angels that defeated them somehow</p>
<p class="regtxt5">come together in me now</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">A tale of beauty and the beast,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I defend my soul from those who would accuse me</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I share the famine and the feast,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have been the world and felt it turning</p>
<p class="regtxt5">seen the jester yearning to amuse me</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Like a circus on parade,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">seldom close enough to see</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I wander through an angry crowd</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and wonder what's become of me</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">To work it out I let them in,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">all the good guys and the bad guys that I've been</p>
<p class="regtxt5">all the devils that disturbed me</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Old Souls</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Our love is an old love baby</p>
<p class="regtxt5">its older than all our years</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have seen in strange young eyes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">familiar tears</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">We're old souls in a new life baby</p>
<p class="regtxt5">they gave us a new life to live and learn</p>
<p class="regtxt5">some time to touch old friends</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and still return</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Our paths have crossed and parted</p>
<p class="regtxt5">this love affair was started long, long ago</p>
<p class="regtxt5">this love survives the ages</p>
<p class="regtxt5">in its story lives are pages</p>
<p class="regtxt5">fill them up, may ours turn slow</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Our love is a strong love baby</p>
<p class="regtxt5">we give it all and so receive</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and so with empty arms</p>
<p class="regtxt5">we must still believe</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">All souls last forever</p>
<p class="regtxt5">so we need never fear goodbye</p>
<p class="regtxt5">a kiss then I must go</p>
<p class="regtxt5">no tears, in time we kiss hello</p>
</br>
</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">War in the Void</p>
<p class="regtxt5">now its just my luck to have the watch with nothing left to do</p>
<p class="regtxt5">watch the empty scanners  as we patrol along our route</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and wonder when they'll come again and pitch us to the war</p>
<p class="regtxt5">whirl off one more youngster in the void</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">the kid was so damn eager, it was all so big and new</p>
<p class="regtxt5">you never had to tell him twice or find him work to do</p>
<p class="regtxt5">evenings on the mess deck he was always first to sing</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and show us pictures of the girl he'd met in spring</p>
<p class="regtxt5">REFRAIN</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt9">REFRAIN</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but I told that kid a hundred times</p>
<p class="regtxt5">don't take your kills for granted</p>
<p class="regtxt5">they'll turn on you and shoot you down</p>
<p class="regtxt5">so fast they'd seem enchanted</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but tonight some red eyed Zeltrop girl</p>
<p class="regtxt5">lies staring at the wall</p>
<p class="regtxt5">for her lover's gone into the Great Void.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">now its a thing that us old timers know</p>
<p class="regtxt5">in the lazy peaceful calm</p>
<p class="regtxt5">there comes a ship from nowhere</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and it hits us like a bomb</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and a fifteen thousand tonner</p>
<p class="regtxt5">can be thrown upon her beam</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and a battle cruiser can be shredded by their beams</p>
<p class="regtxt5">while the void takes all into it with a scream</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">the kid was on the fringes sitting staring at the stars</p>
<p class="regtxt5">from where I flew I swear I could see</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the tears fall from his eyes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">so I hadn't the heart to tell him</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he should be on a line</p>
<p class="regtxt5">even on a flight so close to home</p>
<p class="regtxt5">REFRAIN</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">when they struck he sat up with a start</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I roared to him break left</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but for all that he could hear me</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I could as well not made a sound</p>
<p class="regtxt5">so I broke right to go assist and felt my face go pale</p>
<p class="regtxt5">as franticaly he dodged the volley</p>
<p class="regtxt5">now I could see her swinging round</p>
<p class="regtxt5">to bring the mains on line</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I watched his ship exploding so terrible and slow</p>
<p class="regtxt5">then like some great bear they turned and roared at us again</p>
<p class="regtxt5">while over the com I heard him call my name</p>
<p class="regtxt5">REFRAIN</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">now its just my luck to have the watch</p>
<p class="regtxt5">with nothing left to do</p>
<p class="regtxt5">watch the empty scanners</p>
<p class="regtxt5">as we patrol along our route</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and wonder when they'll come again</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and pitch us to the war</p>
<p class="regtxt5">whirl off one more youngster in the void</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and I tell these kids...REFRAIN</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Prophet's Song</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Oh Oh people of the earth</p>
<p class="regtxt5">listen to the warning the seer she said</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Beware the storm that gathers here</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Listen to the wise one.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Spreading her hands on the multitude there</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Woman who cried for a love gone stale</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And ice cold hearts of charity bare.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I watched as fear took the old one's gaze</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hopes of the young in troubled graves</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I see no day, I heard her say</p>
<p class="regtxt5">So grey is the face of every mortal.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Oh Oh people of the earth</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Listen to the warning</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The prophetess said</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For soon the cold of night will fall</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Summoned by your own hand.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Oh Oh children of the land</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Quicken to the new life</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Take my hand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Fly and find the new green bough</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Return like the white dove.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">She told of death as a bone white haze</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Taking the lost and the unloved babe</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Late too late all the wretches run</p>
<p class="regtxt5">These kings of beasts now counting their days.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">From mother's love is the son estranged</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Married his own his precious gain</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The earth will shake in two will break</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And death all around will be your dow'ry</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Oh Oh people of the earth</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Listen to the warning the seer she said</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For those who hear and mark my words</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Listen to the good plan.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Oh Oh - and two by two my human zoo</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They'll be</p>
<p class="regtxt5">running for to come</p>
<p class="regtxt5">running for to come</p>
<p class="regtxt5">out of the rain</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Flee for your life</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Who head me not,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">let all your treasure make you</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Fear for you life</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Deceive you not</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the fires of hell will take you</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Should death await you.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Gods give you grace</p>
<p class="regtxt5">to purge this place</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And peace all around</p>
<p class="regtxt5">may be your fortune.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Oh Oh children of the land</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Love is still the answer, take my hand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The vision fades, a voice I hear</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Listen to the Mad One!"</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">But still I fear and still not dare</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Laugh at the Mad One.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You've been in the pipeline,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">filling in time, provided with toys</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and 'Scouting for Boys'.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You bought a guitar to punish your ma,</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So, so you think you can tell</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Heaven from Hell,</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Can you tell a green field</p>
<p class="regtxt5">from a cold steel rail?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A smile from a veil?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Do you think you can tell?</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And did they get you to trade</p>
<p class="regtxt5">your heros for ghosts?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hot ashes for trees?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hot air for a cool breeze?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Cold comfort for change?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And did you exchange</p>
<p class="regtxt5">a walk on part in the war</p>
<p class="regtxt5">for a lead roll in a cage?</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">How I wish,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">how I wish you were here.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">year after year,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Running over the same old ground.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What have we found?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The same old fears.</p>
