<p class="regtxt5">The text in the Thoql library says to search for the City of Truths, there shall be found many old and obscure texts dealing with the Orbs and artifacts of Ertan.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Follow the Pilgrimage Ritual and you shall come to the City in the Aryamons.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The text from under Haven tells of a priestess of the Father Creator who many many years after the Conflict went in search of the Orbs, wishing to bring glory to her temple through their possession. She took with her several adventurers for protection and assistance. Upon finding the first Orb one of the adventurers touched it first and fell down dead.  The Orb then disappeared from their presence. Ertan sent her a vision telling her to cease in her quest and to record for the future the fact that the Orbs had to be found in order from the first to the Orb of Direction or from the Orb of Direction to the first. If the search began with the Orb of Direction then it would provide assistance in finding the others.</p>
