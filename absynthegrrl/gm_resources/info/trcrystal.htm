<p class="pagecaption">Thought Resonant Crystal</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thought Resonant Crystal is a crystalline, symbiotic organism that interacts with and strengthens the mental processes of its host. It also has a life-prolonging effect when wore constantly. The crystal retains its life as long as it is in contact with its host. It will begin to die as soon as its host dies. It will become dormant if removed from its host, reviving when placed back in contact.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thought Resonant Crystal can be used as a direct brain to electronics interface. This was used by the Ancients, on Karanal, as a computer interface system. The Ancients on Zeltrop used this capability to create secure keyed doors, tagged to the mental signatures of the wearer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Margla used this property, plus several others, to forge an electronics technology to majik interface when constructing the <a href="../../hut_online/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thought Resonant Crystal is also a key component in the brain scan devices used by <a href="../npcs/elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> and <A href="../npcs/aztol.htm">Aztol</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thought Resonant Crystal is found in a few places throughout the multi-verse. The largest source is in caverns below the <a href="../places/eternia/repository.htm">Great Repository</a>. Another source is in the depths of the <a href="../cf2_inx.htm">Labyrinth</a> on Zeltrop. A tiny garden is in the pocket realm of the Soul Stealers on the <a href="../places/planescape/plains.htm">Discord</a>.</p>
