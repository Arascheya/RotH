<p class="regtxt9">Lady of the Green Silences</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Lost in the plains of Salarvya lies lake Mrissutl and around it lies the forest known as the Green Silences. Here it is said can be found Dahaun, sometimes called Morquant, the Lady of the Green Silences.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The Lady is said to be an immortal placed on earth to render aid to the hurt and lame creatures of the Salarvyan plains. Her beauty is said to be godlike, her manner as a country maid. Dahaun is said to be accompanied by ten green men, so called for the green forrester clothing worn by them. They are reputed to be as fierce of fighters as she is gentle.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Plain of Towers</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The plain of towers is a land that is visited by the heroes of many of the epics of Tsolyanu. Bandatar visited them on his quest for the egg of the phoenix and Valcrin passed through them on his journey across the multi-verse in his search for his beloved Mara.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Where the plains can be found is not known. Few serious scholars have ever attempted to put them on a map. But the few that have all agree on its location as being west of the great desert of Galai, at the world’s end.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The plains owe their name to the great towers built ages past by a race of technologicaly superior beings since gone from the earth. The towers are best described by a passage from the Epic of Bandatar:</p>

<p class="regtxt15">"The tower was of purest quartz, alive with colour and everywhere was the sound of wind chimes. It stretched up at least 150 ft. and was lit by hellfire over its entire length."</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The plains themselves are described in Valcrin’s Ride:</p>

<p class="regtxt15">"... but though the land was wild and barren, we saw no life through the miles.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Bleak though the coutry was, I saw so little difference between it and the lesser dales, that I wondered why it was spoken of as ‘The Waste’. A word which brought to mind visions of deserts unfriendly and sealed against man...</p>

<p class="regtxt15">No, it was not the land itself which did not welcome man, it was rather what brooded over that territory. For as we rode I knew a heaviness of spirit, fear, and a feeling of overwhelming age. This grew with every mile we rode..."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Setting Up of Kings</p>

<p class="regtxt12">On the Kanayugara, at a spot north west of Tlani peak lies the Setting Up of Kings. When the first people came to the river valleys they found the survivors of an elder race with which they mingled. Though the elders were few, the people took from them such customs which had merit. Thus they did use their kings when each died. In turn he was buried, standing, allowed to look out upon the world. And should his successor need good counsel he went to the Setting Up of Kings and abode for a night, waiting to hear that wisdom, or to dream it. Also were they ensorcelled to guard the land of the people, weighing the souls of those who would enter and destroying those found lacking.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Cursed Akhalt (org data)</p>

<p class="regtxt12">This excerpt comes from the dread Book of Skelos:</p>

<p class="regtxt15">"...devil cursed and demon haunted Akhalt on Galai waste, where power mad sorcerers of yore called down to this earthly sphere a demon from beyond. To their unending sorrow...</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Akhalt, where the undying one rules with a hand of horror to this very day..."</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Doomed, accursed Akhalt, which the very gods spurned, transforming all into a burning waste..."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Staff of Myrrhim</p>

<p class="regtxt12">It is said that for the great Battle of Pesh the wind dukes of Aaqa constructed the powerful staff of Myrrhim. In that great battle, where chaos and law contended, the High Duke Donblas, the Justice Maker, was defeated and lost for a time his existance. The staff was shattered into seven pieces and scattered. On that day chaos ruled supreme and exiled the Lords of Law to the nether regions. The Lords of Chaos collected the pieces and placed them in the towers constructed by a long dead people they had been fond of. So great was the fear of the great lords of this weapon that they placed powerful guards over each segment.</p>
