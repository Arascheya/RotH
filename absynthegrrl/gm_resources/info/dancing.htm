<p class="pagecaption">Dancing</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is information from someone who was a dancer for many years.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">What sort of things/exercise programs and the like did you do to stay in shape as a dancer?</p>
<p class="regtxt12">I went to dance class. Any class I  could find. I  sometimes did yoga for flexiblity and strength and some running for aerobic exercise but the best way to get better at dancing is dancing.  Also, ballet is very very very integral to a Modern dancer's (or any other kind of dance) regiment.  It is the base for everything else.  It gives the best strength, flexiblity, balance, versatility. It is like learning scales in order to know how to jam. Although I know many musicians that would refute the comparison.  You can always tell when a dancer has had ballet and when she or he has not.  A good dancer knows how to use the training to her advantage artistically.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">what was the recommended minimum practice time per day/week?</p>
<p class="regtxt12">5-6 days a week.</p>
<p class="regtxt12">Sometimes, two classes a day and then rehearsal on top of that.  It can be relentless but ohh so much fun!</p>
<p class="regtxt9">did you take lots of classes or was dancing with a troupe a good way to learn new things?</p>
<p class="regtxt12">You got to have classes for technique and staying in dance shape.  In rehearsals, there is alot of standing around, marking steps, getting down counts, watching other people's parts, applying everything that is pounded into you in the thousand of dance classes youv'e taken.  Rehearsals are where you get to show off the goods. All the hard work youve' invested in those damn classes. It is not a time a choreographer wants to be correcting technique. It is a time to flam out.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"Any classes you could find" - how do the classes work? Are there set "Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced" classes, or is it more flexible than that?</p>
<p class="regtxt12">Usually there are what is called "company classes" that are set aside for the actual people in the dance company.  But then you can take classes from other teachers in the school that the company spawns from or go to classes in another school.  Usually a dance co. adheres to a specific technique (eg. Martha Graham, Cunningham etc.) so a dancer gets technique centric with whichever technique her co. is.  In a school, there are beginner, int and advanced but it can get pretty mixed up depending on how they structure the classes.  It is always good to go to a class above your skill level.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Would more proficient dancers assist with the newer students?</p>
<p class="regtxt12">Yes. To a point.  However, there can be alot of attitude and a beginner student in a higher level class, they have to be very secure with themselves and be prepared to have the class "kick their butt". Sometimes you can hardly keep up with  all with the steps, it will move so fast.  There isn't much coddling.  Every one is fearful of looking bad and impressing the teacher.  sigh</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Who would become an instructor?</p>
<p class="regtxt12">Company members.  Keep in mind: Some of my worst teachers were the best dancers and some of my best teachers ever were NOT the stars of the show.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">What are common terms for a dancer that is in a lead role and one that is in the chorus?</p>
<p class="regtxt12">Let's see, if you don't have the lead role you are in the "corps".  You may call someone who dances with the group a "company dancer" and then the lead person would be called "principle dancer" If I think of more I will send it to you.  I think this is pretty standard ballet terms.  Lead role would be used too.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Kali - First Dance Class</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire took me to her dance class to introduce me to her instructor. On her recommendation I had on a more modest leotard and tights. The leotard was alright, but I didn't like the way the tights clung to and pulled against my movements. I kept pulling at them under my cargo pants, trying to get them to stop grabbing in sensitive spots.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The dance classes were held in the rooms over Freda's gym. I had never been in a real gym after I escaped from high school. This one looked like a cliche, straight out of the movies. It smelled of sweat, old socks, and slight mildew. Industrial lights spilled bright pools over equipment and shadows crouched in the corners. Sweating bodies moved through workout routines that were obviously well-practiced and automatic. Claire lead me past all this to a narrow stairway and up past fading ballet posters.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Upstairs was another large room, obviously a dance studio with mirrors and barres on the walls. She guided me around the edge, avoiding the few students already warming up, and into a small office. A Short, thin woman sat behind the desk, studying notes and diagrams. She looked up as our shadows fell across her work. "Claire, what can I do for you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jessi, I brought my friend Kali today. She would like to join one of your classes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jessi looked up and then stared at me for a few moments, "Do I know you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think so," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali dances at the Cathouse most nights and she's the stage dancer for Love's Bitch," Claire added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's where I've seen you. You're the one that stands out of the crowd. Where and what have you studied?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Studied? Um, electrical engineering..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, what styles of dance and who were your teachers?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"None and none, I'm afraid. The beginners class would probably be best for me. I don't know anything about dance, other than a few moves my body just knows how to do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want to get out of classes?" Jessi said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know how to do these moves to music, but I don't know what they're called and some of them don't feel quite right. I guess what I'd like to know is what the elements are, how to do them better, and how to know which ones to put together to make my performances better and more evocative."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here's what I would suggest then. I'd like you in all the classes. The beginner and intermediate will teach you proper body form and posture and the names of all the positions for legs and arms, basic steps and improve your technique and the advanced class will be focused on choreography, expression, and developing your style. Since this is your first exposure to dance classes there are a few things you should know. First, everyone watches everyone else but no one cares about you. If I see you exhibiting bad form, I'll correct you. In the absence of comment, understand that you are doing your movements correctly.. Bad form is the greatest contributor to dance injuries. The other thing is, some people take themselves much to seriously in these classes and they tend to target the better dancers when their egos are bruised. You need to be able to take the blunt and harsh in critiques," Jessi explained. "Now, I will give you an example of a typical review from an instructor or casting director, "Your moves are at a professional level, however, your form is sloppy and imprecise. Come back when you can demonstrate proper form."</p>
