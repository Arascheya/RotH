<p class="regtxt5">Through a gentle, loving sexual act, you can wipe away sexual trauma and unwanted memories.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prerequisites: Tantric Wisdom; Knowledge: behavioral sciences 4 ranks</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Benefits: By engaging in a consensual sexual act with a sentient creature, you can wipe away the ill effects, both physical and psychological of an unwanted sexual encounter. As the encounter comes to a climax, the lingering psychological after effects of sexual trauma vanish, restoring your lover to full emotional health, and removing any lingering status effects from the trauma. If your lover is suffering from any sexually transmitted disease (s) or unwanted pregnancy, both vanish.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Demonic pregnancies must succeed at a DC 28 FORT save (using the mother’s CON modifier and base FORT save) or be abruptly terminated. No lingering biological or forensic effects of the disease or pregnancy can be found. If your lover is suffering from a sexually transmitted disease, you are vulnerable to it normally during the act, but are no longer at risk once the sexual ritual is complete.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Your lover is once again considered a virgin for the purposes of certain spells and feats (such as Gift of Innocence). The hymen regenerates in females affected by this feat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If your lover possesses any feats or class abilities directly related to sexual knowledge or sexuality, they lose access to those abilities for a number of days equal to your WIS modifier.</p>
