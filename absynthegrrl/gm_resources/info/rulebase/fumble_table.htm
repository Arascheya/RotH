<p class="regtxt5">These rolls are made when the attacking player rolls a double one on the dice, and all results are final and irrevocable.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This chart will put realism into the game like nothing you have ever seen, unless you have ever been to a society tourney and seen the novices clobbering everyone but those
they're supposed to hit.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">One suggestion, though, as "GOD," you can adjudicate according to level of character by giving the players with characters over say eighth level a lower percent of damage
taken/given, and melee time lost.  That however, is up to the individual "GOD."</p>
