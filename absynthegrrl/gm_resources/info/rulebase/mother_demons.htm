<p class="pagecaption">Mother to Demons (General SU)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Your womb is a gate to a dark and hellish dimension of monsters and foul things, and your vaginal lips are a torrii gate that opens between worlds. You can give birth to powerful, deadly creatures that defend their mother with the dark devotion of a monstrous son.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prerequisites: Racial Exotica, Vaginal Prison</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Benefit: You can give birth to a variety of creatures, an entire ecosystem of monstrous beasts and animalistic demon-kin who emerge naked and feral from your vulva. Many of your creations lack the divine spark that would allow them to remain in existence for long, dying within minutes or hours, but a few of your most beloved ‘children’ are imbued with a portion of your soul. These favored children can survive indefinitely, and can learn, grow, and gain XP and character levels.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The children of your womb are fully described in chapter eight of the D20 Modern Core Rulebook. Your children have average statistics and abilities for a member of their species. Sentient ‘children’ have an unshakable loyalty to you as their primary allegiance, but as sentient creatures may change their opinion towards you over time. When first created, even your sentient children will gladly obey even suicidal and atrocious commands.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Most of your children only remain in existence a short time, determined by their relative power level, before dying and rapidly decaying to dust and dried blood. You may spend action points and/or XP to bind your children permanently to the world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You may birth different combinations of monsters each day, from hordes upon hordes of pitiful creatures to single hulking guardians. The monsters you birth are organized into rough ‘birth point’ categories, based upon their power level. Each category has an associated numerical value. Each day you may birth any number or combination of creatures, provided the total birth point cost does not exceed your CON score.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Birthing your dark children is incredibly painful and difficult, just like natural childbirth. Birthing a child requires at least 1d4 minutes per size category, and after the birth, you are nauseated for 1 minute per size category. During the birth, you are effectively helpless.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is no limit to the number of demonic children you can birth or have in existence at any one time. Your demonic children may be used as familiars, though they provide no nutritional value if consumed nor leave any useful components unless they are made permanent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Special: Only females can select this feat.</p>
