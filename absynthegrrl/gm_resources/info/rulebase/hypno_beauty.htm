<p class="regtxt5">Your amazing charm and personal magnetism can entrance potential lovers and blind them to everything but your presence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prerequisite: CHA 13+, Deceptive, Perform (any) 1 rank</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Benefit: A number of times each day equal to your CHA modifier (minimum once daily), you may exploit your beauty and sensuality to fascinate creatures within 30 ft, causing them to stare blankly at you in erotic rapture. This fascination affect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your CON score (minimum one round) Targeted creatures receive a WILL Save (DC 10 + your CON modi?er) to resist the fascination effect.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roll 2d4 to see how many total levels or Hit Dice of sentient creatures (with an INT score of 5 or greater) you can affect. Creatures with fewer HD/levels are affected before more powerful and experienced creatures. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do not need to understand you or share a language to be affected. Only creatures who would conceivably be sexually attracted to your gender are affected.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If you attempt to use this feat during combat, each viable target receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw. If you choose to use this feat to affect a target not in combat at the time, that target suffers a penalty on his or her saving throw equal to ½ your ranks your highest ranked Perform skill (rounded down). The fascination effect immediately ends if you or your allies attack or harm a fascinated creature in the way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In addition, you may use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible and reasonable. While fascinated, a creature reacts as it were two steps more friendly in attitude towards you. This allows you to make a single request of the creature, provided you can communicate with it. The request must be brief, reasonable and not conflict with the target’s allegiances or self interest. Even after the fascination effect ends, the creature retains its new attitude towards you, but only with respect to that particular request. A creature who fails its saving throw does not remember the post hypnotic suggestion or that you fascinated it.</p>
