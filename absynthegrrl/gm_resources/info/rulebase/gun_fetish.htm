<p class="regtxt5">"This was no ordinary gunfight! This was about death! This was about SEX!" - Barbanne, internet fetish author</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You watch with wide eyed lust as your bullets penetrate flesh, ripping through and destroying beautiful targets. You enjoy killing with your phallic weapon as much as you do true sex, if not even more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prerequisites: Knowledge: arcane lore 4 ranks, Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Weapon Focus (any firearm)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Benefit: You may affect the victim of one of your gunshots with any sexual skill or feat you possess. You must shoot a victim who you would find sexually attractive and your successful ranged attack must inflict at least one point of damage to activate this feat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If you have a feat or class ability that requires you to have a sexual encounter with someone of a specific gender or who meets a specific category, and the gunshot victim meets the conditions, you can activate or enhance the feat. Feats such as <a href="dark_carapace.htm">Dark Lover’s Carapace</a>, which gain potency based on the number of sexual encounters you have each day grow more powerful each time you penetrate a target with your hollow-point penile substitute.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If you have a sexual effect which harms or weakens your lover/victim, the gunshot victim must save against the effect normally, in addition to the normal effects of the wound. Due to the lack of true intimacy, the DC of all saves against your sexual effects are reduced by -10.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If the effect does not normally offer a saving throw, the victim receives a WILL save against the effect (DC 10 + your CHA modifier).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You may not use this violent feat in conjunction with any sexual effect which heals or benefits the target.</p>
