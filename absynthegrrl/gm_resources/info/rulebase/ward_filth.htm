<p class="pagecaption">Wards of Filth (General SU)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everything can be turned to an advantage, even the waste expelled from your body. You have mastered a secret runic language, which resembles but is distinctly different from known rune magic traditions. These strange sigils are known only to you and are potent only when painted by your hands, using your own bodily wastes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prerequisites: Craft: visual arts 2 ranks, Knowledge: arcane lore 4 ranks</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Benefit: A number of times per day equal to one plus your CON modifier (minimum twice daily), you may use your bodily wastes to create an arcane barrier to protect yourself from harm. It requires at least 1d4 minutes to paint the warding circle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The warding circle creates an invisible mystic barrier 60 ft in diameter that protects those inside from supernatural evil. No outsider, fey or undead can enter the warded area, nor can their attacks (either physical or supernatural) penetrate the barrier. The barrier remains in existence until the painted waste dries and flakes away, which usually requires 1d3 hours. The barrier can be broken by physically destroying the binding circle or wiping away the mystically infused shit and urine that composes it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alternatively, you may expend a daily use of the wards of filth feat to duplicate the following spells; Hold Portal or Arcane Lock, which are cast as a mage of your total character level. Doing so is a full round action.</p>
