<p class="pagecaption">Travel Times</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Horse and Walking times</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Movement in this scale assumes 10 hours per game day.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Walking Movement - 20 zeems per day.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Marching Movement - 30 zeems per day.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Riding Movement - 20 zeems per day (animals are moving at a walk, possibly accompanied by wagons).</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ancients Way - horse and wagon - 30 zeems/day</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Cavalry Movement - 40 zeems per day (riding animals unhindered by wagons, going at walk-trot-walk pace).</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Boat Traffic on the river - Rules of thumb</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Assume something on the order of 3 to 8 knot river current, depending whether you're in a narrow main channel (faster) or the side shallows
(slower).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prevailing winds, based on Valley geography, would reasonably blow from the southwest. The ideal vessel to take advantage of this, based on cultural/technological context, ought to be a sort of dhow or felucca: ranging from 40-70 feet in length, narrow beam, shoal draft with adjustable leeboards, powered by sweep (i.e. wiggling a long oar or rudder from the stern like a fish's tail; in modern yachting, doing it with a sailboat is called "sculling") when there's no wind. On a broad reach point of sail (e.g. north with a southwest wind) we're looking at being able to make maybe 10 knots; working upwind (heading
south into a southwest or west-southwest wind), maybe 5 or 6 knots.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An alternative for passenger travel or extremely light cargo is an oared galley, with optional sail. Under oars alone, a wellmade passenger galley (maybe 50-60' long) could sustain a five knot speed of advance without wiping out the oarsmen. [In sprints, maybe 12 knots; FYI, there are suggestions that classical Greek triremes, with longer hulls and much more power, could actually *plane*.]</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Barges are a different thing: big flat boats with wide beam and double-ended hulls (not the squared-off things we see, which are built for engine tugs). All superstructures are very low; this is to reduce the wind as much as possible. Barges, interestingly, usually would go downriver fully laden, drifting with the current; but would mostly need to be empty (or very lightly loaded), traveling with sail set, to make it back upriver against the current. Barges tend to be mostly a one-way trip for heavy stuff.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">(a Raft is a one-way, one-trip downstream vessel, ordinarily dismantled at its destination because its timbers are usually cargo in and of themselves. Treat as a barge for speed computations, mostly.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In general, assume that the vast majority of heavy cargo goes downstream...</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">SPEED</p>

<p class="regtxt5">a dhow going upriver: assume a speed of advance between 3 and 6 knots depending on conditions and local river geography.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">dhow going downriver: staying in the main channel, moves with the current (say 5-8 knots) with a wind effect of plus 5 to minus 3 knots depending on conditions. (the "plus" is capped by hull speed though, which is probably around 11 knots - the longer the waterline at the hull, the higher the hull speed.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">unloaded barge going upriver: all in all, call it maybe 3 knots</p>

<p class="regtxt5">loaded barge (or raft) going downriver: 4 to 8 knots depending on conditions and local river geography.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">TRAVEL IN A DAY</p>

<p class="regtxt5">OK, I've been giving you everything in knots. A knot is 2000 feet/hour. Let me walk that through to Zeltrop measurements:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">20 hours in a day -> 1 knot := 40,000 feet/day. These are lineal river feet of course: the more the river or its channels wind and twist, the
less progress you make as the crow flies.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Google sez:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">1 kilometer = 3 280.8399 feet which I round off to 3280.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">40,000 feet/day divided by 3280 feet/kilometer yields a handy rule of thumb:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">1 knot means 12.2 kilometers (or rather, 12.2 zeem) per day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In other words, for every knot of estimated speed, you cover 12.2 zeem in a day. Ergo:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">dhow upriver: 36 to 73 zeem/day</p>

<p class="regtxt5">dhow downriver: 61 to 97 zeem/day in normal circumstances; unfavorable wind could knock it down to 25, favorable wind up to hull speed, which
computes to 134 zeem/day, but that's damn extraordinary.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">barge upriver: 36 zeem/day if the wind is helpful. (anchored if the wind is not).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">barge downriver: 49 to 97 zeem/day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Remember that all of these speed of advance things are ideal descriptions. NOTHING (save magic I guess) can speed you up; EVERYTHING, from snags, storm, unfavorable wind, waiting your turn at a narrow channel, grounding on sandbars, etc can slow it down or stop it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All sailing speeds are computed from an "ideal" wind: strong, steady, about 15-20 knots. Anything less reduces the speed that can be expected (it ain't like modern yachts, which have the ability to sail well in very light wind), and anything stronger eventually gets counterproductive: you need to shorten sail and batten down, and you're running at less efficiency; although dead downwind it doesn't matter so much. Even a shitty primitive rig gets you up to hull speed with a strong stern wind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Also, wind that is variable as to direction and strength is *way* less usable. Fluky wind is the curse of every sailor.</p>
