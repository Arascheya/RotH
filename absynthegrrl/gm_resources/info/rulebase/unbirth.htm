<p class="regtxt5">Those trapped within your claustrophobic womb return to childhood, with all its weakness and powerlessness, eventually dissolving into bloody nonexistence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prerequisite: Vaginal Prison</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Benefit: A victim swallowed whole by your vaginal prison begins to disintegrate and discorporate, mentally and physically as he or she dies inside you. In addition to crushing pressure and acidic damage, each round the victim is trapped within you, he or she suffers a negative level.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If you chose, you may spend an additional action point as often as once per round of captivity, to inflict even more permanent incorporation on your adversary. Your victim must make a WILL Save (DC 16 + your CON modifier). Success indicates that the victim suffers 1d2 points of permanent CON drain. Failure indicates the victim moves to the beginning of the previous age category, immediately incurring the physical changes associated with aging. A creature de-aged past the Child category dies instantly and quickly devolves from baby to fetus to zygote to a mass of bloody, stillborn tissue.</p>
