<p class="regtxt5">Every satisfied desire arouses the desire for more. By taking your lovers out of their comfort zones, by introducing them to bizarre fetish sex and forbidden acts, you achieve enlightenment, and through the body, bring your submissive lover enlightenment as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prerequisite: Tantric Wisdom</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Benefit: By spending at least an hour engaging in some unusual, taboo, fetishistic or ritually humiliating sexual act with a willing partner (or partners), you can transform sexual tension into insight. Your partner (s) need not have this feat. As the sex act ends, you may attempt a Concentration check (DC 22), in order to derive benefit from the taboo act, beyond the obvious.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If the check is successful, you receive a +2 insight bonus on FORT and REF saves, as well as Sense Motive and Knowledge: arcane lore, Spellcraft and Perform (any) checks. You receive an additional +1 bonus for every 5 points you beat the check DC by. These bonuses are in addition to the bonuses granted by the Tantric Wisdom feat. These bonuses remain in effect until you next sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By spending an action point, you can grant a similar benefit to any of your lovers. If engaging in an act with multiple partners, you grant the bonuses to all lovers involved in the act.</p>
