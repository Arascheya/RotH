<p class="pagecaption">Dark Lover’s Carapace (General SU)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Chitanous spinal plating bursts through your fragile skin, and bone spurs tear through your muscles. The transformation is agonizing, but grants you phenomenal strength and endurance. When wrapped in your demonic armor, there are few things on earth that can harm you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prerequisites: Endurance, either Improved Damage Threshold or Toughness</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Benefit: A number of times per day equal to one plus your CON modifier (minimum twice daily), you may manifest demonic armor, which bursts from your skin and covers you from head to toe in dense organic plating. This armor is amazingly tough. In it’s ‘raw’ state, the Dark Lover’s Carapace grants you a +6 natural armor bonus to Defense. While armored, your maximum DEX bonus to Defense drops to +3. You may maintain your demonic carapace for a number of minutes equal to CON score (minimum one minute) per activation. Activating or dismissing the demonic armor is a standard action, which does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Your demonic armor becomes stronger when you satisfy your lusts. For every sexual encounter (consensual or not) you have enjoyed during the last 24 hours, your demonic carapace receives Damage Resistance 1/- (maximum DR 5/-). This damage reduction stacks with DR from other sources such as Tough Hero class levels or supernatural effects.</p>
