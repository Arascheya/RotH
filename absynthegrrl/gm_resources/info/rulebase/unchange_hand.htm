<p class="pagecaption">Unchanging Hand Technique (General SU)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The alleys of Black Tokyo are crowded with demonic shape shifters and rapacious were-creatures, and you have developed a martial arts style that nullifies their demonic disguises and orphic combat talents.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prerequisites: Knowledge: arcane lore 4 ranks, Combat Martial Arts, Improved Combat Martial Arts, Iron Will</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Benefit: Your kung fu is so powerful that any time you beat an opponent’s Defense score by 5 points or more with an unarmed strike, you lock your shape shifting adversary into its current form. Any creature with the shape shifter subtype or a class ability or feat that functions based on a physical transformation may be affected by this feat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once struck, the shape shifter is locked into his current form for 2d4 rounds, and is considered shaken. If the struck  creature is currently in a form that can only be maintained for a set duration, it immediately reverts to his true form, and is considered fatigued.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You may spend an action point to activate this feat on any successful unarmed strike.</p>
