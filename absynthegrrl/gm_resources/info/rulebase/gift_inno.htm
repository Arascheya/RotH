<p class="pagecaption">Gift of Innocence (Metamagic)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Few things are more precious than a young lovers first sexual experience. You are a skilled sexual teacher, initiating your lovers into sexuality, and drawing mystical power from the unique bond you share.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prerequisite: Tantric Wisdom</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Benefit: By engaging in their first sexual experience with a willing sentient creature, you gain a special bond with that person, as well as a temporary influx of magical potency.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As long as both you and your virginal lover are on the same plane of existence, you gain a sense of the relative distance and direction between you. You gain an instinctive awareness of your lover’s general emotional state and are aware if your lover is ever badly injured (reduced to ¼ HP or less) or afflicted with a disease, poison or magical curse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If you touch your lover while casting any spell with a personal range, you may extend the spell’s effects to the other person. You receive a +2 insight bonus on Sense Motive and Treat Injury checks made against your virginal lover.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For 24 hours (or until you next sleep) after the sexual encounter, you are blessed with a gift for the magic of change, creation and love. You cast all spells from the Conjuration and Enchantment schools at +1 caster level.</p>
