<p class="regtxt5">RQ - add concept of guilds, etc. as alternative to cults for training, etc.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">cask - barrel - 31 gallons</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Dev Ideas from Sally</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A shaman type with tatoos of animals that can come off his body and be semi
corporial that he can use to either spy on things or distract things.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A network of gate like things that are activated by gems, different gems
take a person to different locations in the network.   Of course the gem is
lost when it is used in this manner.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Magical torch light that gets brighter after each test, controlable in that
one can make it dimmer deliberately.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Also instead of having the cults and guilds be the only place to get initial
training have some things available at the different shop keepers places.
Things like bargain, alchemy from the local alchemist etc.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">From Godstalk: Stray bits of "God Power" attaching itself to people and
following them, causing mischief until the True Name of the god is spoken
and a point of temp POW is sacrificed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">From Charmed: Demons or cursed items/just plain curses of the seven deadly
sins Pride, Sloth, Gluttony, Lust, Wrath/Anger, Greed, and Envy.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">One could also have things that brought out the seven deadly virtues as
well; Humility, Meekness, Charity, Chastity, Moderation, Zeal, and
Generousity.   I am not positive of the Virtues as I can not find the
Camelot song about them and I have not been able to find a good source for a
listing of them.</p>
