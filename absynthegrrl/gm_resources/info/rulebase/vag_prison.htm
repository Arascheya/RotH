<p class="pagecaption">Vaginal Prison (General SU)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Your vulva is an inescapable maw, capable of consuming your lovers whole when you finally tire of them. Trapped in a non-dimensional hell of contracting muscle and boiling liquid, your prey’s futile struggles for life only bring you orgasm after orgasm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prerequisites: Knowledge: arcane lore 8 ranks, Gifts of Ecstasy, Iron Will</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Benefit: By spending an action point, your vagina becomes a strange tessarect, a organic fold in space and time. If you have successfully pinned a foe your own size or smaller, you may elect to make a second grapple check, as though attempting to pin the opponent once again. If the check is successful, your vagina warps and stretches to impossible proportions, swallowing your prey whole.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once swallowed, the victim is shunted into a non-dimensional space within your body. While swallowed, the victim is considered grappled, but you are not. In addition, the victim suffers 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage  plus 1d8 points of additional acid damage per round. The victim cannot break free through physical effort, but may escape by casting any form of teleportation or dimensional travel magic, or by succeeding on a WILL save WILL save (DC 10 + the creature’s WIS modifier). A freed creature reappears prone and adjacent to you, in a random open square.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This enhancement remains in effect for a number of rounds equal to one plus the your CON modifier (minimum two rounds). If the victim dies while swallowed, he or she is consumed completely, along with all non magical gear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If the victim is still alive when this enhancement ends, or if the victim breaks free with a successful WILL save, you suffer 1d6 points of damage per the victim’s CHA modifier. You may attempt a DC 18 FORT save for half damage. You may choose to birth a swallowed creature at any time; any magical items swallowed can be vomited up at will also.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Special: Only females can select this feat.</p>
