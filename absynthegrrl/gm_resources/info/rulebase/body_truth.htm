<p class="regtxt5">Men and women may lie to each other, but they share an honesty beyond words during the act of love. You can taste the flavor of truth in a lover’s intimate secretions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prerequisites: Sense Motive 4 ranks</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Benefit: By bringing any sentient creature to orgasm and sampling their sexual secretions, you gain insight into your lover’s personality and motivations. You learn your lover’s primary allegiance, if the creature has an allegiance to any ethos (like law, good, evil or chaos), the creatures sexual preference, if any, and if the creature has lied to anyone within the previous 24 hours.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You receive a +4 insight bonus on all Sense Motive checks made against your lover for 24 hours after the sexual encounter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Except when dealing with the most virulent forms of disease, the amount of sexual fluid ingested is too small to transmit disease.</p>
