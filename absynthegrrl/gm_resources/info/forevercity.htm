<p class="pagecaption">Forever City</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Forever City, one of the episodes of the <a href="shadow_journeys.htm">Shadow Journey</a> games, came with a world editor. Forever City started as a single player game, then became episode 1 of the online Shadow World series. The world editor was modified to support the online model of the Shadow Journey games. It was easy to use, supported a rich and powerful editing environment and allowed Shadow Journeys to become the most modded game series of all time. Forever City takes place in a hive city, think Kowloon Walled City on steroids, and follows the path of a kid growing up in the lower sections. Jaime will want to borrow heavily from Forever City for a location in Realms of the Hut. The game was formative for her.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Basic Forever City structure</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Utilities</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Water</p>

<p class="regtxt12">most water is recycled in vast processors in the lower levels<br/>
                some "new" water is bled in to replace "lost" amounts (evaporation, etc.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Power</p>

<p class="regtxt12">combination of systems</p>

<p class="regtxt15">solar panels on top of city<br/>
                    core taps under the city<br/>
                    fusion reaction plants ringing the city<br/>
                    methane powered generators run from city waste processing plants</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Food</p>

<p class="regtxt12">industrious, often poorer, people grow food on the top of their stacks and deep within their stacks</p>

<p class="regtxt15">food has to be grown around solar collection equipment<br/>
                    fungus related products are grown in abandoned sections deeper in the city stacks<br/>
                    most is medicinals and specialty items not available from food distribution systems</p>

<p class="regtxt12">factory systems outside the city grow raw material<br/>
                most is shipped in for processing<br/>
                techs maintain the automated gear that handles the tasks<br/>
                a few remote farmers deal with animal product production</p>

<p class="regtxt15">processing is only what is necessary to send carcasses to city outlets</p>

<p class="regtxt9">central government only deals with utilities</p>

<p class="regtxt12">food, water, power</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Control and Governance</p>

<p class="regtxt9">most "control" is by Sectors</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Sectors</p>

<p class="regtxt15">controlled by person or council, depending on citizenry<br/>
                "policing" is based on control-freak level of sector governors<br/>
                many sectors are loose collectives of people, just getting by<br/>
                collect fees for maintenance of Sector holdings<br/></p>

<p class="regtxt18">poorer sectors rely on citizens to maintain their areas</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Notes:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">think Blade Runner crossed with Kowloon Free City</p>

<p class="regtxt5">started high tech and prosperous</p>

<p class="regtxt5">diminished over time to mix or mostly poor, some in the middle, and a few with wealth</p>

<p class="regtxt5">provides some type of resource to off-world empire, the Ashatari Empire</p>

<p class="regtxt9">resources auto-mined<br/>
                delivered through automated pick-ups<br/>
                end-game for Forever City segment of Shadow Journeys is to slip aboard a transport and find out where it goes<br/>
                wealthy few control this resource extraction and sale<br/>
                minimal infusion of off-world stuff from this system</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Forever City is rather dystopian, with social classes functioning in the following ways:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Middle Class to Lower Wealth Levels</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The more well-off tend to be wage slaves, thinking they are free, but having no freedom at all. Very few of them will take up the adventure that is the core of the game.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Wealthy</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The wealthy have real power, in their sections they control the wage slaves. They in turn are controlled by the 1% who have insane amounts of power and wealth</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The POOR</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The truly poor are the most free of all the citizens. They live in squallor, tucked into makeshift housing blocks that evolved from the lower class quarters of the original times. They are ignored, as long as they don't venture into the "desirable" areas of the city. They perform the "menial" tasks that keep the city functioning. Many accept the adventure that is the core of the game.</p>
