            First Register of Ships published, to inform underwriters and merchants about the condition of vessels they insured or chartered. An important feature has been the classification of the hull and equipment of vessels. Following a survey, Lloyd`s Register assigned to it a `class`, depending on how well it had been built and its current condition. If it was to remain `in class`, the ship had to have regular surveys.

            An important increase in coverage resulted from the Universal Register , published in parallel with Fielding`s Register of British and Foreign Shipping . The Universal Register attempted to list all seagoing merchant vessels in the world over 100 gross tons. However, entries were brief, especially for sailing ships. - Included for the first time were lists of former names of ships, of ships with names made up of two or more words, and of British shipbuilders with the names of all existing vessels they had built. Foreign builders were included in the list from 1887. Also included was a list of dry and floating docks, and pontoons. Signal letters of ships were also recorded, as were war vessels of all nations.<br/>
