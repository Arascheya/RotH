<p class="regtxt5">Irdisinthyish were a highly technological race, mostly engaged in multi-dimensional concepts and other matter, energy, particle related physics.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One of their experiments dealt with uploading data into the fabric of the multi-verse for storage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Interesting idea - from Requiem - data stored in the space-time matrix, too much will cause corruption and disruption at the point of over-stuffing. The Irdisi tried this and did subtle damage somewhere and now the leakage is causing temporal distortions, rifts, and anomalies as the fabric strains under the load. Using this idea will require the where, when, how, and what to do about it be thought out - need to think more about their place in the time-line and the impact of the <a href="../places/karanal/tannhauser.htm">Tannhauser Gate</a> style systems they were playing with.</p>
