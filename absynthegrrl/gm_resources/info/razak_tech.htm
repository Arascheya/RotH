<p class="regtxt5">Razak battle technology was originally designed by the <a href="drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a>. It was based on their emerging nano-technologies and included the most advanced developments to that point. The primary components of the suite are a set of <a href="../items/ring_onemind.htm">command and control rings</a> for the command staff and a self-replicating viral style nanotech enhancer package. The enhancers reduce dependence on external medical staff through improved healing, poison and disease resistance. The nanites also create a communication system between anyone "infected".</p>
