<p class="pagecaption">Volume 1 - Pre Elentaryn</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">11 Xer ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It has been decided that a diary will be kept so that future generations will understand what has gone before and what the basis is for our policies.  I, Morietal, have been selected to perform this duty.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was also decided to restart our calendar on the xer the war ended.   It has been 10 xers since the final missiles and bombs hit.  This area is large and due to the prevailing winds has been kept remarkably clear of radiation.  We are hoping that there are other areas as fortunate as we are here.  Hopefully we will be able to get in touch with other areas, if they do exist, very soon.  A couple of small private aircrafts survived and enough of a fuel supply to be able to at least check the surrounding 200 zeems or so.  Not only for radiation but also survivors and supplies of food, clothing and live stock.  We are going to be very desperate if none of the animal life survived.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have set up at the large civilian medical facilities a few zeems away from the military command post.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">14 Xer ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We are going to bring all the survivors we can find here.  It is hoped that in this way we may unify the entire planet through the need to survive and a lasting peace will have a better chance.  We have been lucky in finding of enough fuel to reconnaissance this entire side of the mountains, as well as food and parts for the planes and radiation meters.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have decided to restructure our government in the following manner.  Each of the major uncontaminated areas will have a representative on a governing council. There will also be one person to act as an independent representative of the planet as a whole, keeping the entire planet wide picture in focus. This person will be accessible to all people and will be available in case one of the regional representatives refuses to hear any particular issue.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have unearthed the medical facilities that were part of the command complex here.  Thank everything that the only missile to get through was a dud and did not explode.  As soon as we get a power source up and running we will be able to see what type of genetic damage has been done.  My worst fears are that too many of us will be sterile or only able to produce abominations.  The General was so against some of the medical research that went on by the military, not so much the goals but the ways the information was extracted.  I will see that is not done as long as I live.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I don't know what I would do without Kareena.  She is so skilled at soothing the ruffled feathers and strained nerves. A real peacemaker, not to mention our only surviving medical person.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">18 Xer ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Searching the area around the medical facility at the command head quarters has turned up a tunnel leading off roughly in this direction.  Following it to its end we have found the command computer.  It had shut itself down into a wait state to conserve its batteries.  Now we have another reason for wanting a power source, with this computer we can do our search so much faster.  Of course once we get power we still have to break into the thing. All of the security cleared computer techs were killed.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">23 Xer ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have completed the search on this side of the mountains.  The news is worse than I imagined.  On the average only 10 out of 10,000 persons survived.  I am devastated as this area should not have had that great a death toll.  From the evidence 1 out of 100 killed themselves and/or their families within 3 hours of The War starting.  We are all demoralized.  However some good news is that we have found a small group of doctors, surgeons, and Research Physicians having their vacation on an island in a remote lake in the surrounding mountains.  I do not know whom was more glad to see who.  They were running low on food and drinkable water.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">27 Xer ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The ratio of men to women is 2 to 1.  If there has to be an imbalance then it would be by far better for the survival of the race if it ran more women to men.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We are working too hard just to get enough clean food and water, without searching the whole planet for survivors and melding them in with us here.   But I feel that it is too important not to.  I have the strong feeling/knowledge that if we are unified now when all that was has been destroyed that we can weld together a lasting peace.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Last War was fought with nuclear type weapons.  So we know that the land itself will be totally destroyed in some areas, and will stay that way for many zyrodyls.  So far only 20-25 percent of the land we
have surveyed has been totally saturated.  An other 50% will be usable in 1000 zyrodyls or so.  With hard research we maybe able to come up with something to speed up the process.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">30 Xer ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It may sound petty but we decided that as long as we were making our society and when time is measured from that we would remake our calendars.  So from this xer forward there will be 85 xers to a zerad, 7 zerads to a zyrodyl.  So to xer is the 30th xer of the 1st zerad of zyrodyl 1.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">35 Xer, 1 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have found some bigger ships that are being made usable.  With the small ships for survey and the large ships to bring in survivors when we find them this should save time and fuel.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My biggest problem is how to get to the other continents.  I will just have to sleep on it, going to sleep with a problem on my mind tends to bring an answer by morning.  I have not had this happen so often before.  I wonder if it is the slight radiation that all of us have been exposed to, or something else.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">47 Xer, 1 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The survey of this continent is finished.  We will start on the islands immediately off shore and just keep spreading out until the entire planet is surveyed or we run out of fuel.  With the islands we will fly over them and if there are people then we will send a boat.  If there is safe food we will land and get
it.  As we get more organized we will move volunteers to other safe areas to start growing food.  But first we have to get seed for this to work.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">49 Xer, 1 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have established the civilian hospital and the caverns under it as the seat of the new government as so far it is the largest clear area we have found.  We are going to have the area outside the caverns made into gardens.  They will be named "The Gardens of Lazaar" after The General of the combined armies of the Allied Free Countries.  For even thought he was a military man he worked for peace and the good of the people where ever he could.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have realized that technology was not to blame for the war and have pledged to live in peace in the hopes that another one will never occur.  Our main technological goal, at the moment, is medical research. The main goal after taking care of the injured and sick is gene codes for birth defects.  It is hoped that if the gene carrying the defect could be isolated and studied it can be eliminated.  Either by some technique not now known or just by not breeding if the gene damage is of a certain type or severity.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">53 Xer, 1 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Great news!  We found a small village on one of the larger islands that is intact and has seed and fertilizer for growing crops.  They also have living healthy meat animals.  They are willing to join our cause.  This is the first whole town of people we have found.  Due to the winds and the fact that there wasn't a primary target near them, they are all healthier than we are.  They have fruit trees as well, and vegetables.  We were able to eat fresh food for the first time since war was declared.  I had forgotten how good it was.  Gardens and crops just moved up in priority.  None of us realized how hungry we were for fresh food.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are a couple small islands near our new friends that are growing wild fruit trees.  I am overrun with volunteers to go and take care of them and see about putting in a couple crops.  We are so fortunate that we are as close to the equator as we are.  The weather has not been a major problem for us, but for others cold weather may just well be.  We are going to start in surveying the hemisphere that is in winter.  None of us feel comfortable continuing in the survey pattern we had set up now that weather has been pointed out to us.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">71 Xer, 1 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have a working hydro power generator.  We now can do so much more.  Communications, medical and one of the teenagers from our island community was working on an electrical flyer.  With a little help ironing out some of the bugs, he has a viable design.  We were running out of fuel, plus none of us like the pollutants from the current engines.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For the first time I feel like we might just make it.  Our first baby was born, alive and well.  Granted she was conceived before the War but she is the first one to be born alive.  She is going to be spoiled rotten by everyone.  I hope that she does not get upset when the first baby to be conceived after the War is born.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">5 Xer, 2 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have been so busy trying to survive that we are losing track of the importance of sapient life.  So the council's first decision is to have a Winter Solstice Celebration.  We will celebrate the return of sensibility, and that we are alive.  The announcement only went out to xer but everyone is really getting into a celebrating spirit.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">30 Xer, 2 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The solstice party went off well.  The morale of the entire population has gone up.  The majority of the people are still in a kind of shock.  As long as you tell them what to do they are ok.  Luckily some of the first ones found are showing signs of coming out of it, so there is hope for the rest.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">On the planet wide search we are starting to run into weather problems in the hemisphere that is in winter.  The electric aircraft works, which really helps.  We have started building more.  So far only one man and a radiation counter sized but it leaves the other craft available for transporting stuff.  As soon as the design engineers are satisfied with the test model we will build bigger ones.  The hold up is that it is more of a light powered glider than anything.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">48 Xer, 2 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Good news Kareena~ is pregnant with our child.  She is the first woman to become so. I wish we had a way of reading genes.  I am afraid for our child, but I can but wait.  I now realize something else we have lost, we have lost all contact with the deity.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">62 Xer, 2 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I had not mentioned to anyone about the loss of contact with the deity, but  to xer in council it was brought up.  A committee has been appointed to try and find any information on the worship of the deity.  Even the people from the other continents said that the worship of the deity had lost favor and appeal generations before the war.  We have even lost its name.  This also could have contributed to the war.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">85 Xer, 2 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have not wanted to enter into this diary for the last few xers.  Kareena~ had an accident at the hospital.  A patient mad with grief and pain started to attack people.  Kareena~ was one of them.  The doctors don't know yet if she will survive the blow to the head.  She miscarried.  The only good news out of this is that when Dr. Eksivail examined the fetus it was healthy and showed no sign of deformity.  What happened to the patient that caused this the doctors will not tell me.  Maybe they are right that it is better not to know.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Some leads have been found to the problem of the missing deity, but it is not very hopeful as so many records were destroyed.  We will continue searching, but with the accident at the hospital I find myself wanting to, I think the term was, pray to something bigger than I am for help.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">1 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Last night I had a very vivid dream about where to find our deity.  It may seem crazy but I told the committee about it and they are going to go and look for the place of my dream.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">4 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The committee came back to xer and said they found a chamber just like in my dream, with everything my dream had in it.  Complete with an old holy man who had preserved the faith and artifacts in the countries held by the Dictator Jardiral.  We are hoping to find some thing that will tell us if this man and his artifacts are for real, at his insistence.  So we are going to dig up some carbon dating equipment and such.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">7 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have gotten all the people out of the harsh weather areas in the northern hemisphere.  The search goes on to the southern hemisphere before winter sets in down there.  Luckily there is not much axial tilt and we have an almost perfect circular orbit, so winters are not as severe as they could be.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The ratios are looking better, 1 male to every 3 females, it gives us a better survival chance since there are fewer survivors than were estimated.  People are forming group families instead of the monogamous relationships that were the preference before the war, I think that it is mainly to share the children, we have so few.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kareena~ came out of her coma to xer, she even recognized me and said my name.  The doctors said that this is a very good sign.  I went and talked to the old holy man afterward.  Even if he is a fake he brought comfort to me.  He also gave me a book on how to let my conscious mind hear the subconscious mind.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When I have the time I will have to look in the tunnels and caves under the caverns we are in.  But if what the old man and the book said are true then this ring is the cause of the ideas that come to me during the night.  The old man said that the reason the ideas come at night are because that is when my sub conscious mind and my conscious mind are the closest.  But that with work I could learn to be more accessible to it in a meditative state.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">9 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We are really making so much progress it is really hard to believe.  Of course we all are putting in such long hours, but that does not explain it all.  Just too many things have gone right the first time.  I think our deity is still with us.  According to the old Holy Man the deity is called Ertan (pronounced Air+tan).  The search for the carbon dating equipment has gone well and we should have some results later to xer or tomorrow.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kareena~ was released from the hospital to xer.  She must still take it very slow and build back her strength.  But Dr. Eksivail thought that she would do better out of the hospital and in an area where she feels safe and away from the reminder of the attack on her.  She will sleep a lot, I have been told, as the body repairs itself.  We tend to have forgotten that the body can fix itself most of the time if we just leave it alone long enough.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">14 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Carbon dating proves that the artifacts and the books are as old as the old man says they are.  Most of us believe him anyway.  Maybe because we want to believe.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I wish the general had lived long enough to tell me more about this ring he gave me.  It has a seven sided stone of a strange bluish purple crystal that has motes of light swirling in it.  His last words about it were that he had found it "down below".   I don't know where he could have been referring too.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">If only we could get into the information stored in the war computer, we could shorten the time of land survey.  The computer would know where our missiles were headed and what incoming ones got through.  Also I would really like to be able to convert it to something useful.  The medical people could really use the number crunching and storage capabilities of a large machine.  I will have to put the problem to the council, maybe we can allot more time to cracking into the hunk of junk.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">16 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The council has decided to assign our 3 most computer literate people full time to work on getting into either the information stored in the machine or to converting it to something we can use.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">25 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To xer, a small group of children were playing in the caverns, and found a secret door at the end of the passage way second from the left.  Being bored they decided to explore rather than get an adult, and they got lost.  We had the entire population out looking for them.  After the door was a stair down into, what is now being called, the Tunnels of Confusion.  We found all but one boy in these tunnels.  It was a miracle we found them at all.  It ended up with two people standing at every intersection down there.  We could not even follow the tracks because of how fine the dust is.  A track just does not hold in that powder.  After getting some sleep I will go back down with some balls of string.  One person tried to map the area but could not get it right.  Almost drove the fellow nuts.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">On our way back with the children we noticed that the walls of the tunnels and caverns after the secret door are smooth as glass.  The walls of the cavern we have been using are natural rough cave type walls.  These were constructed by someone with a technology that we do not possess.  I will have to tell the council my thoughts on this.  Maybe visitors from outer space is not such a far fetched idea after all.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">26 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I found the little boy just before noon to xer.  He had somehow gotten through the Tunnels of Confusion to another hidden door.  Had I not been running my hand along the walls and attaching the string every few feet I would not have found the panel that opened the door.  Apparently he had found the door open but it had closed after he had gone through and could not find or reach the panel to open the door again.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The workmanship is fantastic.  Even knowing where the door is I cannot find the cracks or the panel.  I looked around for the panel on the other side and it took awhile to find it.  I don't know whether to tell everyone about this or explore it on my own.  I have mixed feelings.  I wonder if this is the "down below" the General was talking about?  It is possible that these caverns hook up with where the computer is.  Tactically it would be a good place to locate it, under a major civilian hospital.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">27 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In council to xer we talked about the find of the hidden door and what could be beyond it. I told them of my thoughts of the construction of the caverns and of there possibly being a way through to the computer.  We are sending a team of volunteers to explore the area.  In all of recorded history none of us has ever heard of any other beings on our world.  It is felt that there probably are not any living beings down there.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I will go with them, my curiosity would not allow me not to.  Kareena~ has decided to go with me.  Dr. Eksivail thinks that it is a good idea.  He also told me that Kareena~ is in no danger from the man who attacked her as he died shortly before she regained consciousness.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">29 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We leave xer after tomorrow on our exploration.  We are planning on being gone 3 xers to a week.  We will have enough food and water for an additional 2 xers.  It is hoped that we will find a way into the area that is easier than the Tunnels of Confusion.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">36 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is more to the underground area than I thought there was.  There are natural underground caverns with large pools and lakes with streams connecting them.  On the same level as the Tunnels of Confusion, but past them, are lots of rooms that look like they were meant for living in (this has possibilities as we are running out of space).  We did not explore that area completely as we were looking for a way to get to the computer, and felt it was lower than that level.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There may be even more.  We could not check all the walls for little panels, and we found another long stairway leading down.  However I did see an indentation that my ring might fit into.  I do not know why I did not try it out when we were down there.  Except that I had the overwhelming feeling that there was something there that would not be good to share at this time.  I think I will look up our resident Holy man and talk with him some time soon.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We found a way to the computer, through another panel door.  A very surprised Doriend, the lead technician, greeted us. We also found the computer's back up power plant, the lines between them were down so that it could not be activated.  With this shorter way to the computer, Doriend is quite happy.  Now instead of 3 xers travel from the Gardens to the computer it will only take one xer.  Now we can also set up a com link so that we can communicate without all the hassles of trying to get a signal through and around so much rock.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I will mention to the Council that we could house people in the lower areas, if there are people willing to at least sleep there.  Some of our party had to return to the surface because of adverse reactions to being underground and closed in.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">42 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Things are running real smoothly.  We have gotten the orientation of newly found people down to a routine that works the best.  We are not expecting to find many more.  All that is left is the isolated hermit type or the small group on vacation.  With the hydroelectric and the nuclear generators we are broadcasting
messages over all the airwaves.  So that if anyone is still out there they will not feel like they are alone.  We will set up spots that we will check every week where people can come to if they want to join us.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What is left is the hard part of getting crops in and harvested.  Hardly any of us have ever done anything like it.  Most of us did not even have a house plant.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">65 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl AWL</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Doriend called on the com link this morning so excited that we could barely understand him.  Apparently they have gained access into the computer and are dumping all the information onto paper.  We felt that this would be the safest way, just so that a safety trap is not accidentally triggered and we loose all the information.  Also this way we can purge the entire system and start from scratch.  We may not blame technology for our plight but we sure don't trust a machine that was built and programmed to destroy.  The more I think about it the more I hate the "military" mind set, even though I was in the military.  Hopefully we will never get to the point where that type of thinking is encouraged and bred for.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The council has put all personnel not involved in necessary survival tasks on the job of wading through all the print out.  Doriend says that it will take xers just to get it all printed off.  None of us read as fast as a printer prints, I fear that this could get boring fast.  We are breaking it into sections by category and field, so that the waders are at least reading through stuff that they start to understand.  As I was in the military, as aid to General Lazaar, and read most of the military codes, I get the "Top Secret Projects" file.  This will take some time but should prove interesting.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">67 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I decoded the titles of the projects first.  There is one that sounds, very interesting, its code name is Tharth.  Which using standard decoding decodes into Zeltrona, the name of the planet on the other side of the sun from us.  I am hoping that it will have information on Zeltrona.  Zeltrona is a very strange planet, it is directly opposite from us and in our orbital path.  Zeltrop and Zeltrona are like the ends of a baton twirling around the hand/sun, hopefully never to meet.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">80 Xer, 3 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It took awhile but I finally got the Tharth file decoded.  It appears that our military started a colony on Zeltrona without the civilians’ knowledge or consent.  If my calculations are correct the colony was started about 5 zyrodyls before the Last War.  I can only hope that they are self-supporting at this time or that they die quickly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The council has decided to see if we can get a message to them and let them know what has happened here.  From the file we have the coordinates of the relay satellite.  Hopefully, in all of this information from the computer there is the frequency and codes needed to establish contact.  It was the only thing not in the file and no reference was made to how many people are over there.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">1 Xer, 4 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I find it hard to believe that four zerads have already gone by and that it has only been four zerads.  We did so much in such a little time.  We are really working together so well, all things considered I am shocked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A message was sent to the relay satellite yester xer, the earliest we can hear back is 7th of this zerad.  That is if they respond immediately without taking any time to think on an answer.  We are all uneasy, the more we find out about Project Tharth the less we like it.  It has been realized that we here on Zeltrop do not have the ability to send any spacecraft over to Zeltrona to pick up the people there.  What if there is too small a gene pool to survive but too many people for spacecrafts and fuel they have.  What will we all do?  The reading of the military information seems to be going so slow, now that we are looking for something specific.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">7 Xer, 4 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It is late and so far we have not received a reply to our message.  I figure that we probably will hear something in three to five xers.  There is a person at the radio around the clock, until we can rig up something to automatically record any incoming messages.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">10 Xer, 4 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Here is the message we received from Zeltrona/Tharth:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">To: Zeltropian Council</p>
<p class="regtxt9">From: Commander of the Tharth Project</p>
<p class="regtxt9">We received your message.  We do not have enough ships to return all personnel to Zeltrop. We do not have enough fuel here to make more than a one way trip with all our ships. It has been decided that we will all stay here until such a time as we all can return home.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">How soon can you start making fuel?  We realize that this will          not be for a few zyrodyls as you will have to rebuild most of the factories and such.  Did any of the fuel dumps and rockets survive?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">How are we going to be able to explain to them that we will never start manufacturing that fuel again?  It created too much toxic by product.  Not to mention the majority of the raw material sites are too radiation saturated to get near for at least 200 zyrodyls.  The council is trying to decide how to word our reply.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">14 Xer, 4 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The council has been meeting for extended sessions these last few xers, but no headway has been made on the message to the Tharth personnel. We will have to send something soon. I am in favor of laying it all out for them no matter the energy cost.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">16 Xer, 4 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The message we have decided on is as follows:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">To: Commander Tharth Project</p>
<p class="regtxt9">From: Zeltropian Council</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Stand by to record following message</p>
<p class="regtxt9">We regret to inform you that there are no rockets or fuel dumps left, and that the mining fields are radioactive beyond safe working levels. The total of attainable non radioactive fuel is enough to get one  ship to you, that is if we had a ship left to send.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">It appears that your stay on Zeltrona could be very long, if not permanent. We don't see how we can get space travel in any time under 20 zyrodyls in reality probably closer to 50.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">At the end of this transmission are the global stats on how things are now, and the bones of our new government. If you have any ideas on how to get a space program started, please feel free to tell us.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">We could possibly send an unmanned craft with imperishable supplies. It would not have a very good chance of getting there as we are short everything needed to build and launch a rocket.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">There is also the problem of families being separated. We have a few people who think their loved ones are on Zeltrona.  As we do not have a roster of your personnel it is impossible to know.  We are for trading lists of survivors, and then deciding what to do.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the transmission was technical data on the planetary condition and guide lines for our government.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I fear that our message could cause the Tharth Mission to explode. Hopefully they all keep their heads on straight.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">30 Xer, 4 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have not heard from Tharth at all.  I fear the worst, as they did not go through the cleansing fire that we here on Zeltrop did.  All we can do now is pray and move getting space travel to a higher priority.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have though gotten an automatic listener for the radio.  It records on a loop tape, and when it detects in coming messages it sounds an alert.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Life goes on as normally as can be expected.  I am going to take a couple weeks off and explore the tunnels.  The other night Kareena~ said that she would like to get away from everyone just the two of us.  She is still easily depressed over the loss of the baby, and the doctors say that she should wait a zerad or two longer before trying for another.  She is not the only one impatience with the wait for a child to hold.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have talked to the Holy man but he knows no more than what was in the book he lent me.  Maybe I should invite him along, I will talk it over with Kareena~.  I am torn between exploring the caverns and exploring Kareena~'s and my relationship.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">45 Xer, 4 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A message came in from Tharth.  Like I suspected, some people did not take our news very well.  But the majority were of sounder and calmer minds, the commander suggests that we consider them sending a craft to here and us sending it back.  We have fuel for one trip over, and he thinks he knows how to send us some more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We now have a list of the Tharth personnel, and it was suggested that we trade match-ups.  Trying for the largest possible gene pool for both planets.  We had been registering survivors already, so we were able to rather quickly run a cross match for relatives.  There was only one match up, a woman here has her husband and her brother living there.  They are the only survivors of their families.  Does she go there, or do they come here, or do we just leave it as is, or do we trade sister for brother.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">50 Xer, 4 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The council decided that since we have the larger gene pool, that Alanora should go to Tharth if she so desires, as well as anyone else who absolutely can not be happy here.  In our return message we are suggesting that anyone there who really wants to can come here.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Gene pool wise that is the best we can do. Supply wise if Tharth can get fuel and ships to us, we can trade help back and forth. Already our young electric genius figures he can come up with a solar powered craft that could run between the two planets. His is stopped by the energy needed to launch off of the planet's surface. If we could come up with a fuel that was not so toxic to refine and use, we could run shuttles up to the solar ship. Well as the saying goes, I'll sleep on it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It is now up to Tharth as to what we do.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">60 Xer, 4 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kareena~, the Holy man and myself are going to go and explore the tunnels beyond the area we are using.  We started using the area beyond the Tunnels of Confusion once we figured out the quick way through.  We are also using some of the rooms at the bottom of the stairs that lead down to the computer level.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is nothing pressing happening at this time.  We are planning on being gone two weeks but don't send search parties until three weeks pass.  We will leave tomorrow early.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">74 Xer, 4 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kareena~ wanted to try to map the Tunnels of Confusion to try out a mapping theory of hers.  It worked, she just recorded the intersections not the distance.  It is a viable method, she used it to map the rest of our travels.  I will just insert our trip diary here and tomorrow I will catch up with what has been going on up here on the surface.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Xer 1: After testing Kareena~'s mapping strategy we continued on down to the Computer Level.  We mapped out all the rooms in the large and small clusters at the bottom of the stairs.  Finding that the underground "pool" is really a very large underground lake.  With lighting the area could be breathtakingly beautiful.  The next trip we will bring a small boat or canoe down and explore the lake and measure it.  The water is warmer than we expected, so it is possible that there is a hot spring feeding into this water.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">We decided not to follow the tunnel around the left side of the lake but to follow the path on the right to the computer.  After the short stairs, we came upon two more groupings of rooms and another long circular stairwell down with a water fall flowing down its core.  A very impressive sight.  We retraced our steps to a small beach on the "river" from the lake to the waterfall.  We will camp here for the night and in the morning continue mapping the Computer Level.  If we have time on this trip we will go down the Waterfall Stairs.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Xer 2: We can see an island in the lake from the bridge that crosses the river leading to the waterfall.  We mapped another grouping of rooms and crossed over section of lake again.  Mapped another section of rooms and came to the passage we postponed exploring to map the route to the computer.  This will shorten the way to the computer.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....Back on the main path, as it were, we cross the lake twice more, come out on a ledge above the water with a beach across from us.  There is a waterfall near the beach which leads us to believe that we have been on that beach.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....We are keeping our hands on the wall looking for more panels or seven sided indentations.  But so far we have not found any. </p>
<p class="regtxt9">This part of the passage is long with no rooms or side passages it ends in a passage way leading to the right which has not been reported as being explored.  So we take it.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....After a frustrating xer we have mapped out a large grouping of rooms and a large natural cavern.  We are going to camp and rest for a few hours and then continue our searching.  We have come upon a passageway that just ends abruptly.  Too abruptly to be the end of the passageway.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Xer 3: After an hour or two of searching we found a seven sided indent that when my ring was placed in it a door opened to reveal more rooms.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....After a lot of confusing rooms and tunnels we came to a section of rooms that are decisively man made.  Most of the tunnels and rooms have looked almost natural, except for the smoothness of the walls.  Even that could be ignored and explained away as possibly volcanic or water action.  These rooms are not rounded but have geometric shapes.  At the core of this section is an area that looks like it might have been a medical or a resting area, with hot and warm pools and a water slide.  We are going to spend the rest of the xer here and possibly the next few xers.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Xer 4 & 5: Spent just lazing around and relaxing.  The Holy man left Kareena~ and me alone for most of the time.  He is very discreet.  We found lots of little private beaches all along this private warm waterway.  There is a rail to stop one from falling into the colder and faster moving water of the lake we skirted on our way here.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Xer 6: On our way early in the morning according to our watches.  </p>
<p class="regtxt9">....Back on to the path to the computer we noticed that after the panel door the tunnels are not smooth and they look totally natural.  It only takes a little while to map out the few tunnels on the computer side of the panel door.  We told the technician about the short way and left him a copy of the map so far and notes on what we have found.  Now for the Waterfall Stair and onto the next level.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....We can go on the left side of the water or the right. It is decided to go left.  This level also has some beaches but not as many as the Computer Level, nor are there the natural caverns either.  The left side did not lead very far, in comparison to the previous level.  The right side is also smaller than the last level.  But we did find another stairwell down.  We will camp for the night and start down in the morning.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Xer 7: More and more the place is looking like it was carved out of the rock.  What might have been natural caverns appears to have been left behind.  I wonder who built this complex and why.  The rooms now show signs that they might have had doors.  Up to this point the rooms just had open doorways except for the panel and ring doors.  This level is bigger than the last but not as big as the Computer Level.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....After going right we have come to an island with another water play area.  This one is not as big as the other but you can dive in here.  So far we have seen no animals, insects or plants.  I hope it continues this way.  We will camp here for the rest period and continue on tomorrow.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Xer 8: We finished mapping all we could find and then set out down a long semi-straight tunnel, that only had one side passage that ended in a cluster of square rooms.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....I wish a compass worked down here, for I think that we have come back to the area we were in yester xer.  We found another island.  To get a real accurate picture or map we will have to bring a boat and map the waterways.  We finished mapping all the areas we can get to.  But we found no more stairs down.  Both the Holy man and I feel that there has to be more down here.  Also there is the fact that from the water play area we could see a room that opened onto the lake but we have not found a room that we can see the water play area from. So tomorrow we will go back to the water play area and swim across to the room.  We have also not found  where the water is going to, there is a strong current to the water near some of the beaches.  However I was right in that the area where the second island was is back over on the water play area side of the lake.  We found this out by starting to note down all the visible features one can see from the beaches, bridges, and ledges.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Xer 9: Back at the water play area we are prepared to enter the water and swim to the room we can just see.  I swam out to check on the currents and temperature.  I will swim across with a rope and then the others will follow.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....Crossing was not the problem I thought it would be. After going through a couple dozen rooms we found a beach that overlooks a whirlpool.  We assume that this is where the water leaves this level.  A little while later we found the down stairwell.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....This level is the first level without the thick dust for the floor.  That dust is strange in that we do not sink into it nor any of our belongings, but it is so fine it will not hold a track for more than a few seconds.  The first almost two dozen rooms were the biggest rooms we have seen so far, besides the natural caverns.  Then there was a group of rooms like we have become accustom to, after that we move into square rooms and corridors that are straight with right angle corners.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....There are lots of rooms that are open to the water and we can see lots of other rooms across from us.  What these rooms were used for I can not fathom.  Their lay out just does not make sense.  Since coming into the square section we have been using standard mapping techniques.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Xer 10: We should start thinking of turning around and heading back to the surface, but I feel compelled to continue on.  The Holy man also feels that there is something more here and that we should find it.  These rooms are tedious to map and find your way around in.  We have taken to marking door ways with numbers so that we do not get lost.  One more xer and then we will head back up.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....Late to xer we finished with the square rooms and entered into a large cavern it must have been 200 feet by 300 feet.  On the other side was a passage out to an even bigger cavern at least 1000 feet by 1000 feet.  We have stopped for a rest and to try and figure this out.  We have walked all the way around the outside edges of both caverns and there are no other exits.  But there has to be, I know there are two more levels below us and that the way down is in this large cavern.  The Holy man suggests that I meditate.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....After meditating I was able to walk right over to the column that has the stairs down in it.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....This level is also square rooms it could take us xers to get through all of this.  We have decided to have me in a light trance with my eyes closed and Kareena~ will ask me which way.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....We reached a long hallway that was straight and then we went back into the square rooms again.  In less time than it takes to write  about it we were at the stairs down.  We start down.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....After almost two hours of climbing down we are at the bottom of the stairs.  We will camp here tonight and continue on in the morning.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Xer 11: We can not spend much time looking around down here to xer.  We want to be back to the top of the Long Stairs tonight.  The tunnels and caverns look to be all natural down here.  But it appears that some
work has been done to them.  What ever it is that I am looking for is near.  After an hour or two of looking we will have to go whether we have found it or not, those stairs will take hours to climb back up.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....We have come to another abrupt ending passageway with an indentation, we will have a bite to eat and then open the door.  On this side of the door there looks to be bone fragments.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....There is another cavern on the other side of the door with light coming from the other end.  In the corner to the left of the door is an old skeleton whose arm was broken.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....The light is from another room but the room is covered in crystals like my ring.  The light is generated by all the moving motes of light.  Something inside each of us says that we should not touch the crystal.  We cannot walk into the crystal chamber without touching the crystal so we left it, until we can come back with clothing that will protect the crystals from our skin's touch.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....There is a table in the skeleton chamber and on it is a short travel diary written by General Lazaar.  He had accidentally gotten lost when the computer was being put in and found his way down here.  Outside
the ring door was a skeletal hand holding the ring he gave me.  He picked it up and put it on.  Opened the door and moved all the skeleton to the corner.  Finished entering in his diary and left hoping to be able to come down here again.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....I am going to have to come back when I have more time.  Back up the stairs and then we will camp for the night.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Xer 12: We are all sore and stiff this morning.  We are planning on going as far as the water play area on the next level and camp there for the night.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">....We made it with not to much trouble.  Swimming across really loosened the tight muscles.  I think we will stop at the hot springs on the Computer Level for a xer if we have the time.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Xer 13: Stiff again this morning but not as bad as yester xer.  We made  it to the hot springs and luckily no one else was here.  We will stay here tomorrow and then return to the surface the xer after.  Unless someone comes here and wants to use the place.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Xer 14: The computer tech came by early for his morning swim and told us that there were messages from Tharth to be taken care of.  So I am returning to the surface and Kareena~ and the Holy man will follow later.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">75 Xer, 4 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tharth will send a ship to us and Alanora will return on it to Tharth, along with some supplies they need. Two of their people want to come here and besides Alanora two of ours want to go there.  So they will be returning with Alanora.  After this exchange we will not be able to have any trade with Tharth except through radio waves.  For as long as the relay satellite works.  I passed out the trip diary and the Council agrees with me that this should be looked into and, until we find out more about what all this is, to keep it quiet.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">76 Xer, 4 Zerad, O Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kareena~, the Holy man, two council members, and myself will leave in two weeks to finish exploring the crystal room and that area.  We all feel that this is important.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have compiled the supplies that Tharth wants and are just waiting for the ship to arrive.  Luckily the ship that is coming is large enough to handle four people and the supplies.  A pilot is coming with the people returning here.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">81 Xer, 4 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It is funny how the values of the people and society have changed.  Privacy is the number one important thing followed by truthfulness.  The truthfulness may in part be due to how we on the Council have been treating the jobs.  We have established a written policy of telling all about a situation to who ever asks, and most of the time we tell before we are asked.  The tunnels under this complex is the first time we have not volunteered information right after finding out about something.  I think it is also due to the fact that our society before the war was based on "need to know" foundation, and we are all reacting to that.  The average citizen did not know that relations with Dictator Jardiral had fallen into such a rocky state.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have received word from Tharth that we can expect the craft to arrive in 40 Xers unless we hear otherwise from them.  So there will be enough time for us to go explore and get back.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">1 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl AWL</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have decided to move our exploration up and we are leaving tomorrow. I will be taking one of the portable battery powered computers with us so that hopefully I can keep a better record of our trip.  Also negate having to put the trip diary in this main diary by hand I can just do a machine to machine feed.  We are doing our best to keep our level of technology up.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">So far we have lost quite a lot, although computer technology has been saved.  Farming technology needed to be revamped anyway, we were ruining our soil with our old ways.  Fishing is now done by small boat again, it does not bring in as much in a xer but we do not kill fish and mammals that we do not want to.  It is hard but we are learning to live with our plant instead of enslaving our planet.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">2 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have got to come up with a better dating format, this way is clumsy.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We left on time this morning and are going directly down to the bottom, we will sight see on the way up.  We all want as much time at the bottom as possible.  We have made good time and are camping in the big cavern.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We are talking over naming or numbering the levels so that we know what level we are talking about.  So far we have the Entry Level, the Tunnels of Confusion Level, the Computer Level, the next two levels do not have any special features, then this level is the Cavern Level, then the Square Level, and the Bottom Level.  Why I am so sure that it is the bottom I can not be sure, but I am.  The other way of labeling is to number them.  With the Entry Level being one, the Tunnels of Confusion being two, down to the Bottom Level being eight.  But that does not feel right, the bottom should be seven not eight.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is a room after the Tunnels of Confusion that has a table and seven chairs formed out of the stone floor.  I get the impression that seven is a magical number or something.  We have six major clean inhabitable areas.  So our Council numbers seven, one for the people of each of the clean areas and one for the planet.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Of course the Entry Level could be called zero or just the Entry Level and start numbering from the Tunnels of Confusion.  That feels right.  So the Computer Level would be Level 2 and the Bottom would be Level 7.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">3 Xer, 5 Zyrodyl, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We all were so excited I do not think any of us slept much, but we were all up early and ready to go.  Down to Level 6.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">....We got down to the crystal room in good time.  We are all in better shape now than before the war.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The look on Councilors Edenel and Yirhota's faces was priceless.  I wonder if we, who were here before, looked that way.  While the Councilors were staring at the crystal room the rest of us looked for more hidden doors.  We found nothing.  So, we are all going to put on long robes, gloves, and hoods and enter the crystal room.  All of us have an aversion to touching the crystal with our bare hands or my ring....It is hard to say how big the room is due to the crystal growths.  Having to move so carefully makes it seem bigger than it is.  At the back of the room is a wall made of refined (the only term that comes to mind) crystal.  It is smooth and the growing crystals do not touch or adhere to it.  In the center is a seven sided indent.  I am now going to put my ring into it.  Just in case this is the death of me and the ring survives, take the ring turn the small switch inside so that it is lined up on the other dot, stare into the crystal and project yourself into the crystal.  The ring accepts you if the switch returns to its current setting.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">....A door opened.  As we walked in we saw old equipment that has been mothballed.  There are other doors in here. We are going to eat and then explore this place.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">....Some of this old equipment looks sort of like computer equipment, others we do not have the remotest idea as to what it did or does.  Best guesses so far are that this equipment was either abandoned or mothballed for later use.  What does not fit with either of these theories is that one  needs my ring to get in here.  Oh well maybe more study will give an answer.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">....We spent the rest of the xer, until we were too tired to even focus our eyes, searching for anything to give us a clue to this stuff.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">4 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl AWL</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Last night we all had dreams of this place, it maybe that we were just over tired but then it may not be.  We will do as the dreams suggest and put the equipment together and power it from the battery packs we have with us.  How it could match is well beyond me, but Counselor Yirhota says that if the people who owned this equipment were our ancestors then our technology has a good chance of matching.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">....The equipment is assembled, it is a chair with a helmet attached, inside the helmet is more refined crystal that will make skin contact at the forehead and base of the neck.  There is a cover for the hands, again with refined crystal, but not only does this touch the hand there is a place  for a seven sided ring to fit in.  Does this mean that seven sided rings were used by everyone?  We talked it over and I will be the test subject.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">....This is Kareena~.  What ever the equipment is doing it does not appear to be causing pain but it is taking a very long time, so far 3 hours have gone by.  Morietal's face is peaceful with occasional wrinkles of concentration, like he is receiving information or seeing something.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">....Four more hours went by before the machine stopped humming and the helm and hand covers sprang up by themselves.  Morietal said he was fine just tired and thirsty.  He drank and said that he had to go to sleep so that he could assemble all that he was shown and learned.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">5 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Morietal here, I slept for 16 hours straight.  Now I feel lots better.  The machine is called a Brainscan unit.  It was developed by a group of scientists that were fleeing the destruction of their world by another race of beings.  It was used to make sure that no one of their group was a member of this other race or had been brainwashed by them.  We are either direct descendants of these scientists or mixed with the indigenous life form.  The scientists hid in these caverns for generations and when they finally ventured out on to the surface of the planet, they had lost most of their technology.  The skeleton was the last of the scientists, he set this place up so that maybe some descendant would find it and re-attain that which they had lost.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We, the Council, must all decide what should be done with this.  I can make rings for those who would like to receive the same information that I have.  To receive information one must have a ring that is attuned to them. The ring I have is a special one, the only one ever made, and the old man making the learning cube did not know how it was made.  I suggest that this ring be made into the badge of office for the Planet's representative. There is a lot of information on the crystals stored in the refined cubes.  As soon as a language expert can help me we will get translations so that it can be read.  This Brainscan is a quick teacher but it can only give what was programmed into it, the old man forgot that who ever found the stuff might be speaking and reading a different language.  So most of what I got is almost useless until the language problem is broken.  Anything that was shown, as the making of rings, I understood.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As soon as I make one ring we will leave here and return to the surface.  This is too much for us to decide or handle.  This will test our commitment to "tell all" to the people.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">6 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We pushed hard to xer and made it to the hot springs on the Computer Level.  We will enjoy the water for a bit tonight and then push on early in the morning.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">7 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We arrived back at the surface mid morning.  A special council meeting was called and it lasted for hours. Funny, I expected the Council to react with fear bordering on panic, like they would have had this been found before the war, but they just took it in stride.  I wonder if we have been through so many terrifying times that we do not scare or if it is that we have faced our race's total annihilation and our stupid fears and petty ways were burned out of us.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We decided to tell the population and ask for volunteers to help explore this find.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">10 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are more volunteers than we know what to do with.  We are running the names and occupations through the computer to see who has the best chance of figuring this out without damage.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It is a test of the program.  If the program works we maybe able to us it to match people to jobs.  We are trying to cut the fine edge between what a person wants to do and what we need them doing.  We are hoping that this will help.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kareena~ told me last night that she is with child again.  It is earlier than the doctors wanted but she is healthier than she was when she first became pregnant.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">12 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Overall our health has improved since the war.  Radiation wise it appears that people died or got a small enough dose to get over it quickly or not show any signs.  With the use of the computer the medics have been able to check everyone for genetic damage.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Family structure has settled on a group family/village structure, where there are breeding individuals and non-breeding.  Every one is very protective of the children, no matter the parentage.  The children are benefiting from the larger families, more attention, and the adults have to define to each other what is allowed and what is not.  It has improved discipline of both the children and the parents.  Children are not a status symbol anymore, they are our future.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">People tend to be more and less religious now than before the war.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">More: the Holy man, I wish he had a name, is very popular and is much in demand.  Already he has some acolytes learning from him.  Ertan, is a very practical god, and that has helped us more than anything.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Less: the fanatical element is gone, people are more private about their beliefs, and not as ready to condemn someone who does not believe exactly as they do.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">20 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have decided that as long as we are careful in the mining of the ingredients for the rocket fuel and watch the refinement closely we can continue to have trade with Tharth.  I think the planet has been renamed, no one calls it Zeltrona anymore.  With refining the fuel we will be able to build the solar powered shuttle craft.  The only way to make the refining cleaner is to do it and work on it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We are working so hard to survive and to save our technology level, it would be easier to just survive.  But if we allow ourselves to do that we are possibly condemning our descendants to repeat our mistakes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Such decisions we have to make.  None of us were prepared for this, and we are admitting it to the general population.  The biggest step is making people realize that they are responsible for their actions and the actions of their minor children.  The children have learned this quicker than some of the adults.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I wonder what kind of parent I will be.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">25 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 Zyrodyl ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Back to my dating problem, I think I will drop zyrodyl out leaving it as 25 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 ALW, I have also proposed naming the zerads.  It is very low on the list of priorities.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">40 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The ship from Tharth got in yester xer, everyone is healthy but happy to be on a solid planet.  We will have the ship ready to launch in 5-10 xers.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Crystal project is making some headway.  A language expert took the one ring I made and ran the brainscan on himself.  He thinks that he will be able to crack the spoken language problem soon, then maybe we can get enough information to start printing off what is in all of the memory cubes.  A name for the Crystal has been offered up and agreed on, Thought Crystal.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the underground complex has been mapped out.  A couple of surveyors and cavers decided to work on it in their spare time.  They got so wrapped up in it that they forgot to come back up, by the time they remembered, they were so close to finishing that it only took another xer.  Now we have complete maps, in scale and everything.  Of course there may be more secret doors that we have not found yet.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">55 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The ship left on time, and with no difficulties.  Last word from them they were doing well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have a future, the first baby conceived after the war was born two xers ago.  She is healthy and normal.  This is reassuring to all the expectant mothers and fathers.  Work continues on a safe long term contraceptive.  Short term ones have been found, but they are inconvenient to use.  Work is also continuing on being able to do more than just read gene structure, we are hoping to find a way of repairing the damage done by the radiation.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">65 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It is slow going but we are gaining.  Most everyone is out of shock now.  Those that were going to die of the radiation and injuries have.  Those that were not are fully up and operational now.  Depression is giving way to the hard work of survival.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Our first crops have come in and are better than expected.  We will be short on meat until all the effects of the fallout have shown up and are dealt with.  But we should not have any starvation, it must be the first time in quite a few centuries.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">All reports from the ship are good.  Our young genius, Elenta, is working on the plans and designs for a solar shuttle.  The Tharth group thinks this is a good idea, but none of their people can understand Elenta's equations.  None of us can either, really, a couple people can at least understand the basic concepts he works on, but he is almost redefining physics.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kareena~ is doing well.  We are starting to think about population control.  Although it is too early for over population to be a real problem, we want to get a good system into effect now before it is needed.  So far we think that the planet will be able to hold 100 million without major problems.  This figure could be higher depending on how well we can reclaim the radiated areas.  So we are going to aim for a planet population of 90 million to leave ourselves with a safety margin.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">75 Xer, 5 Zerad, 1 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The request for naming the zerads has become a high enough priority to be worked on, finally.  Instead of naming them after someone or some place we took random consonants and filled in with vowels until they were pronounceable.  Then shortened if needed to a usable length.  The first zerad is called Sarahabra, the second Garateal, the third Dorienal, the fourth Tamer, the fifth Krena, the sixth Haralei, the seventh Marahasal.  Now at least I do not feel like we are as trapped by the military way of doing things.  I hated the way everything was numbered instead of named.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">85 Xer, Krena, 1 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Things continue, slow but sure is the way we are going about everything.  We are studying everything and idea before we work on it.  So much before the war was done the quick and easy way with no thought about any cost other than the monetary cost.  So far none of us are in that much of a hurry to get anything done.  I think our culture will be a slower one.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">20 Haralei, 1 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I realize that I should enter into this more often, but I get wrapped up in every xer life, and unless something comes along that is real big I feel like I am just babbling.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Crystal project is moving along slow and steady.  It is hard to figure out a language when you cannot talk to someone who speaks it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The project with the solar shuttle will take zyrodyls to get past the drawing board stage.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I think I will start entering once a zerad or when something comes up.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">20 Marahasal, 1 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The ship to Tharth got there in good shape.  Communication is slow and is only used for high priority information exchanges.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Thought Crystal project is gaining momentum.  I have made 3 more rings and they are in use.  Kareena~ insists on having one, she is wanting to know if they will effect the fetus.  We have no way of knowing without a pregnant woman putting one on.  Kareena~ says that she will not let anyone else take that risk.  But most of us feel that there is too much risk and we have so few fertile women.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">25 Marahasal, 1 AWL</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kareena~ decided that, we men, were being too cautious about the Thought Crystals, she put on a newly finished ring, without warning any of us.  It has only been a xer but she and the baby are doing well.  We can but wait and see if there will be any damage to either of them.  The baby is due in 70 to 75 xers.  Sometimes I feel like a nervous wreck just thinking about being a father.  Thank goodness family structure has changed, now Kareena~ and I are not alone in raising our child.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">1 Sarahabra, 2 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have made it a full zyrodyl.  The new zyrodyl celebration has had a real meaning to it this time.  Everyone let themselves relax and enjoy themselves.  The major stress now is the stress of survival, a healthier stress by far than the pre-war stress we were all under.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">All projects are making steady headway.  The Thought Crystals are helping us to understand the artifacts on the lowest level.  All the workers on the project are sure that they are close to cracking the language and they all are sure that there will be lots of information that we can use.  Kareena~ was working on the project until the last few xers, she is close to her time and did not want to have to climb back up to the hospital if labor came early.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The designs and model of our solar shuttle are done, so far the model does every thing we want it to.  The next step is to start gathering supplies and calculate how much fuel will be needed to get it into orbit.  Others are working on the refining of fuel and such.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The specialists say that soon we should be able to start living above ground.  That all the radiation that was sent up has come down, they want to hold off until Dorienal for safety's sake.  Most people are torn between wanting to be able to live in a house with windows to look out of and fear.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">11 Sarahabra, 2 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kareena~ had a healthy baby girl to xer, both are doing fine.  We still have not decided on a name, maybe the baby will give us a clue.  She is so small, I have not been around babies much in my life, they are so small, delicate seeming.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">So far there is no noticeable effect from the Thought Crystal ring, on either Kareena~ or the baby.  Although Kareena~ says that she felt like she knows what the baby needs by just thinking of her.  But the doctors say that is what most mothers say.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">1 Garateal, 2 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It appears that Kareena~'s bond to our child is two way.  Not only does Kareena~ know what the child needs or wants but the child knows what Kareena~ wants.  The baby's name is Rael.  I could go on for hours about her, I am in love again.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The language has been figured out and it is so easy that we have decided to use it for the planetary language.  This way there are not the hard feelings for using one peoples language and not another.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have enough fuel to start building on the solar shuttle and a small landing station.  The supplies are being gathered and pre-fitted together so that we will, hopefully, not have to waste fuel on mistakes.  It is hoped that in the future someone will be able to figure out a better fuel and/or method of refining, to reduce the toxic wastes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It has been suggested to the Council that we start thinking about exploring the moons and if the needed materials are found to build a refining station there.  The proposal was discussed and was tabled for
the time.  It was felt that we are stretched too far right now to put energy and time on a space program.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">1 Dorienal, 2 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Everyone has willingly adopted the old language.  We have sent radio messages to Tharth about the language and they are enthusiastic also.  As soon as the shuttle is completed we will send a tutorial over to them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tharth is working on a station for the shuttle at their end.  They have the advantage of more raw resources but the disadvantage of no established factories.  So the shuttle will be equipped to dock with the rocket ships directly as well as with our station.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With the break through on the language we are making significant headway in figuring out the old equipment.  The brainscan is terrific for teaching, we all realize that it could be easily abused so after we learn all that we can we will dismantle it.  The knowledge we have gotten from the old stuff has really helped in the computer fields.  We are already starting to look into redesigning the main computer.  It has been suggested that a planetary computer and network would be handy for keeping us all together, and the Council agrees totally.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">People have started moving into the safe areas.  With the added farming we will be able to survive.  We have run out of all the salvaged food.  Our food animals are due to drop their young at the end of the zerad.  There has been a 10% barren rate, and a 10% miscarriage rate so far.  They are faring better than we are in that way.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">1 Tamer, 2 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have had a 30% survival rate in the new births of the food animals.  So far the plants are doing well, there appears to be some mutation.  Some areas more than others.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rael is growing and is so active!  Thank goodness there are so many adults willing to watch her, she wears us out so quickly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Thought Crystal project has gotten to the medical information.  The doctors are going nuts, I just hope that they don't kill themselves with the long hours of study.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The shuttle is going well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Now that people have survived out in the open, more and more people are moving out of the caves and caverns onto the land.  If we make it to the next spring it is safe to say we have survived.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Council has started to set up population controls and plans. Anyone who wants more than two children will go to Tharth where they do not have the restrictions on number of children.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">1 Krena, 2 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We started launching stuff for the space station.  It should be completely assembled by the end of the zerad, and operational a few weeks after that.  Once it is running and we are sure that no malfunctions will show up, we will start building on the Solar Shuttle.  The Shuttle is to be only big enough to hold two or three rocket loads of stuff and people plus pilot.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once the Space Station is operational it will be practical to explore the moons.  We are lucky in that a space station was planned before the War, and all we had to do was modify the existing plans.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Thought Crystals are a living crystal that makes a symbiotic relationship with us.  The movement of the motes of light show whether the crystal is attuned or not.  It is also possible to read the emotional and mental state of a person attuned to a crystal by the movement of the motes.  The crystal dies when the person does.  There is mention that a dead crystal has strange properties, but that portion of the information is not readable for some reason.  It is possible to use the attuned crystals as keys for locks and such, if we still had security clearances this crystal would make the best pass ever.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once the crystal is attuned, it is painful to remove it from physical contact with the body.  The farther the crystal is removed the worse the pain. Apparently the crystal once attuned will die if it is removed from its partner, and the partner feels the crystal's pain of dying.  There does not appear to be any side effects other than the previously mentioned problem.  So far all the benefits have not been categorized.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With the medical equipment that has been built from the information with the Thought Crystal Garden, it is possible to make quicker and more accurate diagnosis, not only of mental health but physical as well.  One tends to heal faster and better if one is attuned to a crystal.  Children born to mothers attuned to crystals are healthier.  They even seem more mentally quick, but this could be that there is a stronger bond between mother and child.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">1 Haralei, 2 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Now that we are on top of everything and things are going so well, we are starting to relax and enjoy life.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Space Station is assembled and is being brought on line.  It is going real well and is on schedule.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We want to ship to Tharth some of the refined metals, and the equipment and information so they can refine their own.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Medically, we are doing better than well, the information from the Thought Crystal Gardens has been more than we could imagine.  Given the pace the medical staff is working, in a zyrodyl or two we will be able to correct most of the minor defects from the radiation and before.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Food wise we are still short, but there have been mentions in the information from the Thought Crystal Gardens of being able to grow food in a vat!  If we find out how this is done we will have to have a planet wide meeting to discuss it.  Without us preying on the herd beasts they would over populate the planet, most if not all the natural predators were extinct before the War.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">1 Marahasal, 2 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Things are going well.  The Shuttle is almost ready for its first trip to Tharth.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have gotten most of the information we can use out of the stuff at the Thought Crystal Gardens.  I cannot let the brain scan unit be disabled.  I know it is a dangerous tool, but something in me (or my ring) does not want it destroyed.  I will hide it when they are done with it and show the next First Elder where it is, after he or she has attuned the ring that is.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">1 Sarahabra, 3 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Two zyrodyls we have survived.  I never really thought we would make it this far.  I am speechless when I think of all we have done.  If it had not been for the people stranded on Tharth, I do not think we could have done it.  Somehow the thought of giving up and leaving them kept most of us going and striving harder.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Shuttle is on its way to Tharth with more supplies.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Food is still the most important thing.  Shelter is still rather crude and not all that comfortable, but as things get better we start making things more comfortable.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Privacy is a big factor, after living in the caves for almost two zyrodyls with almost 100,000 people we are all looking for a place of our own away from everyone else.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rael is growing faster than I would like her to, it seems like she was just a baby yester xer and to xer she is a little girl, tomorrow she will be a young lady, the next xer she will be an adult on her own.  Maybe it is the father in me not wanting to let go.  She will be a zyrodyl old in 2 weeks, she is running around and talking up a storm.  She loves us to read to her, she knows some of her favorite stories by heart.  Next zyrodyl she will start school.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">1 Garateal, 4 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It has been over a zyrodyl since the last time I made an entry.  Things are going on at a slow steady pace.  I have decided to give up the First Elder position and spend time with my family.  We have found a small tract of land in the mountains, we will raise some animals and some vegetables for our own use.  We have ten in our family, 8 adults and two children, with 2 children on the way.  I may later run for a small office, but Kareena~ and I agree that it is time for our family.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">I, Morietal, relinquish position of First Elder to Merrilan on the 2nd xer of Garateal, 4 ALW
