<p class="sectioncaption">I, Eltaryn, accept position of First Elder by council authority on 42nd xer of Tamer, 1600 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My approach to this journal will be to treat it as a personal diary, that way I may remember to write more frequently.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have accepted this position more from coercion than by choice.  The old first elder died after having chosen me as a candidate for the post, unfortunately he chose only me.  At the time the selection was made Doriendal and I were working on the new shuttle system.  I had tricked him to insure that I was the one to pilot the test vehicle since I knew he would have died had he done so.  During the test flight the ship crashed and I was seriously injured.  It was during my convalescence at the med center that the old first elder decided I would be his only selected candidate.  He had died before I had an opportunity to decline the post, as was my right under our constitution.  By the time I did protest, he was dead and I was the only candidate, had I declined I would have left my people without a First Elder, a situation that has not existed since the Last War.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After accepting the post, under protest, I began to have strange dreams about some impending disaster, one that seems to require that I am First Elder during it to insure the best outcome of whatever it is.  Thus I seem to be stuck with this position for a while, but, as I told the council, I don't have to be happy with this turn of events.  I have vowed to hold the council strictly within the limits of power granted them by the constitution and to insist that anything requiring my approval is completely understood and approved by me.  No rubber-stamping will occur while I am in office and if they don't like it they can fire me! Now on to happier things...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Tharthian girl, Kayara, and I are quite close now.  I originally met her briefly when the last shuttle arrived.  I met her again when Doriendal invited her to dinner after they met at the computer center.  After that dinner she spent most of her free time with us.  After the crash of the experimental shuttle I found out she spent most of her time sitting with me, waiting for me to regain consciousness.  She fills an empty place in me, one I didn't even know I had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A curious point, though, is her vagueness about certain aspects of her life on Tharth.  Many of her descriptions are very vivid and detailed, yet a few dealing with the Tharthian government and hierarchy are rather sketchy.  For some reason she is not yet willing to talk about some aspects of Tharth.  She does not seem to be exactly what she wants everyone to believe she is.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marnek, the previous First Elder, left a message for me concerning the existence of a diary of previous First Elders.  Apparently it starts with the first holder of this office.  As soon as I get a chance I will have to look through it.  He also mentioned some type of brain scanning/teaching device hidden in the lowest level of the labyrinth.  He said the only editing he did to the old diaries was to remove from them mention of the hiding of the brain device.  Apparently a First Elder was told to destroy it but hid it instead.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">45 Tamer, 1600 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have just had a chance to read the old diaries! These answer so many questions!</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">75 Tamer, 1600 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kayara and I are living with each other now.  The feeling of an empty space being filled is two way.  This has formed a very strong bond between us. We always feel better whenever the other one is nearby.  Many times we do not need to talk, just be near or touching.  Of late the bond can be felt over greater distances.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaya and I have taken to exploring the labyrinth in what little spare time we have together.  It gives us a chance to do something together and prevents interruptions, which seem to occur all too often these xers.  We have even had people intrude on us when we were out enjoying a quiet dinner.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">82 Marahasal, 1600 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaya and I have found a small grouping of caves near an underground river.  The entire area has a pleasant, warm, almost friendly feel to it.  We are seriously thinking of using this area as a retreat when we want privacy.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">13 Sarahabra, 1601 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This xer while exploring we came upon a side tunnel that smelled of animals.  Thinking it to be the lair of something potentially dangerous we began to slowly move away.  Suddenly a large cat-like creature that had bounded out of a small chamber off the side tunnel pounced us on.  Fortunately when it hit it had its claws retracted but it still knocked us down because of its size.  It was over 2 meters in length and weighed quite a bit.  After it had us down it began purring and worrying at us like we were large toys.  When we didn't struggle it finally got bored and moved off a ways.  It then stopped and waited, like it was waiting for us.  It made no move to pounce on us as we started to get up but would take a couple of steps toward us then several towards where it had come from.  Being curious we followed it through several tunnels and chambers until we came to its lair, where we were mobbed by a litter of kittens.  It also led us to a way to the outside and then back to where we had first met.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">37 Sarahabra, 1601 ALW

<p class="regtxt5">We are now using the labyrinth caves as our primary living quarters.  It is a fairly long walk to the gardens but the privacy is well worth it.  We are planning to borrow a small thermal drill and cut some quicker routes to the garden entrance, however we are worried that this would make us easier to find.  At the present time if we need quick access to somewhere we go to the tube train station at the computer and go from there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We often go play with the cats that are even friendlier now that they are used to us.  Several times one or more of the growing kittens have tried to follow us home.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">45 Sarahabra, 1601 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have strung a computer link to our cave residence from the computer area and hidden it in the walls of the tunnels.  Kaya has placed a priority program into our electronic mail boxes so if an emergency occurs we will be alerted to it at our residence.  All other messages must await our pleasure.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">50 Sarahabra, 1601 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have been finding one of the kittens at our quarters every time we have been there for the past three xers.  Watching him closely has shown he leaves when we do and returns when we do.  He always follows us when we go wandering in the tunnels and seems to know when we are headed to the surface.  He will only follow us out if we leave through the cat lair.  We have taken to calling him "Beast" because it seems appropriate somehow.  He seems quite intelligent, watching every move we make and studying anything we look at.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">25 Garateal, 1601 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="eye_first">(First Bionic Eye Reference)</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">I never would have imagined that the job of First Elder would be so time consuming.  I now begin to understand why it was so easy to fall into the trap of signing things without really reading them.  I have had very little time to help Doriendal rework the problems with the shuttle and build a second prototype.  He will have to fly this one when it is ready.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Whenever I have a little spare time I have been working on an electronic eye.  I am hoping to be able to graft it directly to the optic nerves and thereby replace my left eye.  I am very tired of the perpetual blind spot I have on that side.  Conversations with several of our leading physicians and biologists lead me to believe it will be possible.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaya finally told me why she left Tharth and why she did not want anyone to know.  She has asked that I not write down or tell anyone at this time.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">29 Tamer, 1601 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Doriendal has completed and test flown the next version of our airframe.  After finding and correcting the hydraulic seal problems that we found on the first unit it looks like this design will work very well.  The fuel efficiency was even better than we thought.  The payload can be increased another 5% beyond our original calculations and travel times will be much reduced.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">74 Krena, 1601 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The final designs have been checked and approved.  Limited production of the new shuttle craft will begin immediately.  If the system continues to work as well as the original tests then the old shuttles will be replaced with the new technology as they come in for major rebuilding.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">80 Haralei, 1604 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="eye_2">(Bionic Eye Reference)</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have produced a small imaging device that will fit into my left eye socket area. The imager works very well but I still don't have any ideas how to interface it to me.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">50 Dorienal, 1605 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I finally managed to find and look at the hidden brain device.  It is indeed the unit mentioned earlier in the diaries.  I, too, am reluctant to mention its existence at this time, maybe later...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Well, I had to try it and see how it worked.  It taught me several equations that seem to relate gravity, electricity, and magnetism together.  Using Marnek's method of saying "it came to me in a dream..." I gave these equations to several of our leading theoretical mathematicians and physicists.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="eye_3">(Bionic Eye Reference)</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">It has also given me several ideas on how to interface the imager to my nerves. I will need to have several of the medical types help me with this one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I investigated the locking system of the door I opened to get here, and found that it contains a piece of refined thought crystal that appears to "read" the patterns present in the crystal on my ring.  I guess that there must be a basic pattern that is part of this ring or else the door could not recognize and open for more than one ring wearer.  If we ever have to go to security systems of any form this would be an ideal locking/id mechanism.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Tamer, 1605 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After much experimentation I have managed to duplicate the lock from the brainscan room door.  Kaya and I will now cut the shortcut tunnels we want and place hidden doors on them using these locks to keep them closed.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">25 Tamer, 1605 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="eye_4">(Bionic Eye Reference)</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">The prototype eye interface has been bread boarded and works very well. Next will be the construction of the actual miniature unit.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">60 Krena, 1605 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="eye_5">(Bionic Eye Reference)</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">The unit has been installed and works. I am finally free of the blind spot on my left side. Now I can start flying again!</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">79 Krena, 1605 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After many nights of quiet work we have installed a tunnel and direct access stairwell to get from our labyrinth quarters to our old quarters in the castle.  The door lock systems work very well.  We have found that with the addition of a small controller computer they can be easily programmed to allow other people through them.  So far we have set them up to allow ourselves and Doriendal access.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">60 Marahasal, 1605 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The mathematicians and physicists were able to develop a unified fields theorem based on the equations I gave them.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">60 Marahasal, 1606 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="eye_6">(Bionic Eye Reference)</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Like all good projects I haven't been able to leave the eye imager alone. I have added digital signal processing to it, along with alternate spectra imaging. I have expanded the electronics packaging into part of the sinuses for additional space. So far this has caused no real problems.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">7 Dorienal, 1607 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="eye_7">(Bionic Eye Reference)</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">More eye enhancements, this time a comm link with the computer network. At last I can fly as well as Doriendal, I can get flight info from my craft fast enough that my slower reactions can keep up with his.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Sarahabra, 1610 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Delkos developed by Doriendal and myself have begun to increase trade between Tharth and Zeltrop.  They are also greatly improving resource use and development on the planetary moons.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The computer system is being expanded again.  This time to link more remote research sites.  As soon as cabling is finished it will enormously aid information storage, processing, and retrieval for these sites.  Soon we will have to find a way to expand the system's memory, with all the new users it will soon be overloaded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaya and several others are looking at significant operating system changes, hoping to do more distributed processing, using the main system for data exchanges and for massive computing power only when the smaller units are too limited.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Garateal, 1620 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mining ships and colonies have been constructed in space and on several planets’ moons thanks to the new shuttle and fuel technologies.  Work is being done on developing a full-scale exploratory craft.  Since speed is still a problem, we are working on some form of cold sleep system.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="hullmetal_1">(Hull Metal Reference)</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Several large finds of mineral deposits and advances in space based manufacturing have led to the development of a much stronger metal that we are planning to use for space ship hulls.  The actual name of it is Rivoite, after the metallurgist who created it, but everyone refers to it as Hull Metal.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="gravnull_1">(Gravity Manipulation Reference)</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">By use of the recently proposed unified fields theorems a gravity generator/controller has been developed.  It is capable of generating artificial gravity or nullifying existing gravity.  So far size limits its use to large ships.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Marahasal, 1630 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several biochemists and geneticists have succeeded in discovering the structure of thought resonant crystal!  It is a silicon-based organism whose intelligence increases based on the quantity of "cells" present.
Parts of its structure allow it to resonate with our brain impulses.  For a detailed analysis see misc. chemicals handbook.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The exploratory craft, Listrania I, has been completed.  For the time being it will be used for in-system exploration only since we still have not solved the problem of speed.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Tamer, 1640 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Listrania I continues to serve double duty as an exploratory craft and as a large cargo ship between Tharth and us.  As our physicists continue to study exploratory results they become more and more curious about our planet's relationship with Tharth.  None of their theories are yet able to account for the fact that Tharth and we are positioned in the same orbital path but directly across the sun from each other.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The increased trade and contact between the two planets has led to several joint exploratory voyages and a greater appreciation for the diversity of our two cultures.  We are basically a democracy and peaceful while they are more of a monarchy and more ready to fight. We have shared the information in the old diaries with the Tharthians.  They, too, are very happy to have information on their past.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have visited there several times and Lauryl Xarantha, their leader, has visited here. She was very happy to see Kaya again. They spent several days wandering around together. She is a bit of a bitch, but I like her all the same.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Garateal, 1650 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Biochemists working with the same processes and principles that revealed thought resonant crystal structure have succeeded in isolating the molecular structure in our brains responsible for our ability to attune thought resonant crystal.  It is a protein with several modified amino acids.  For a detailed structural diagram see the misc. chemicals handbook.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">18 Sarahabra, 1653 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Many advances in medical diagnosis have come from the further understanding of thought crystal. It is now possible in many cases to scan a patient with a thought crystal scanner and obtain basic body function information from computer analysis of the resulting data.  This has greatly reduced the need for invasive type blood and tissue sampling.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">42 Tamer, 1655 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The time finally seemed correct to mention the existence of the brain scan unit to the council.  After discussion we have agreed to make it available to researchers on a "by request" basis.  It will remain on level seven since we don't want to risk damaging it.  For the moment anyway the door will remain keyed to the First Elder ring only.  While showing the unit to the council several councilors tried their rings in the lock system.  None of their rings worked.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">5 Krena, 1657 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Using information from the brain scan library and the structural information on thought crystal several biochemists and electrical engineers have developed a way to use thought crystal for electronic memory systems.  They have several small prototypes going now, each one with far more storage capability than any other device of similar size.  We will soon fit a couple of test modules on one of the small computer systems and check them for reliability and speed.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Marahasal, 1659 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The reliability tests went exceptionally well and now most small computer memory systems have been upgraded to thought crystal cubes.  The speed and reliability of these units has also noticeably improved. From now on any memory expansions in the main computer will use these cubes instead of other devices.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These results have the design types looking more seriously at optical computing systems. They are hoping if the crystals can be properly stimulated they can produce logic component equivalents in crystal modules.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">16 Haralei, 1660 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="hd_1">(Hyper Drive Reference)</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Several theoretical physicists have postulated a hyperspace drive system.  Research facilities and resources have been allocated to this project.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The other big problem with extended space travel is the time factor involved. Many researches had been working with various methods of deep sleep or hibernation to allow for longer trips. It looks like a method has been developed that might work. The process called Thermionic Suspension and is the brainchild of Tamera Sarkarn and Jalana Kontril.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Additional information on brain functions and thought crystal properties, from the brain scan library, has allowed development of Thermionic Suspension.  The method consists of storing the person's memories in a thought resonant crystal memory cube, sedating the individual, and cooling the body.  The heart and respiratory systems are shut down, blood is replaced with a special solution which basically places the body's cells into a chemically inactive state without them acting as though they died.  Oxygenation and blood cleaning are provided by an external system.  When wake up is begun the suspension fluid is removed, a cell activator solution is pumped through in its place and then replaced with warm blood.  Once this process has been completed the heart and respiratory systems are restarted and then the body is injected with Time Derivative, the information in the memory cube is reloaded, and then Natryamine is injected to nullify the Time Derivative.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Before we apply this system to exploratory ships we will wait for preliminary reports on the hyperspace research.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">5 Sarahabra, 1670 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="hd_2">(Hyper Drive Reference)</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">The first hyperdrive unit has been constructed at one of the research stations.  Tests indicate that it can generate field distortions large enough for theoretical entry into N-dimensional hyperspace.  Small unit tests are now being planned.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Garateal, 1675 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="hd_3">(Hyper Drive Reference)</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">All small unit tests have been successful.  Several manned explorations have been sent short distances and returned safely.  Biomed reports no apparent damage to the test pilots.  The large exploratory craft, Listrania I, is being outfitted with the new drive.  Doriendal is heading up the design/modification team. I really hate this job some days. I no longer have any time to be involved in R & D projects.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">23 Marahasal, 1676 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first all optical computing system has been built. A simple operating system has been designed and installed. Testing has shown no major problems in the design. Kaya is working on a more complex operating system while the designers are expanding the system.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">36 Tamer, 1677 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first useful optical computer system has been tested. Several applications have been ported to it and run many times faster than on an electronic system of similar size. More units will be built and distributed in a beta test configuration. The design team and Kaya will start working on a multitasking operating system next.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">67 Haralei, 1678 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="hd_4">(Hyper Drive Reference)</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Listrania I has completed several short distance voyages with the new hyperdrive systems.  All voyages went very well, there were several small difficulties due to the complexity and newness of the hyperdrive system but Doriendal and his team were able to cope with them without any serious danger to the ship or crew.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A long-range mission is now being planned.  Doriendal will command the L I and the rest of his design team will hold significant crew positions.  At this time they are the most experienced with the new technology.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">77 Haralei, 1679 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Beta testing and debugging of the multitasking operating system and optical computer has been completed. New systems are now available for any group that wants one. Design of optical processor modules for the main computer system has been started.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">26 Haralei, 1680 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Listrania I has departed on an extended exploratory mission.  Estimated time of return is 5 Zyrodyls.  As a precaution the ship is equipped with both defensive and offense weaponry.  The crew consists of Tharthians and Zeltropians.  Since part of the Tharthian culture is martial training it is felt the ship should at least be able to protect itself should anything unexpected occur.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">8 Marahasal, 1685 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">No news yet on the Listrania I, she was supposed to be back several zerads ago.  We have been over all the designs again and again to see if we missed something that could have gone wrong.  No one has found any apparent design flaws.  We will wait and wonder a little while longer.  If we have no news by mid Tamer next zyrodyl we will send a small ship out along the proposed flight path and see if we can find any indication of what went wrong.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Sarahabra, 1686 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Listrania I has limped home missing half her scout ships and many of her warriors.  The crew tells of making contact with a well established colony belonging to the Alliance of Planets.  After the initial shock of contact by another group they were shown lavish hospitality and were just settling down for some ship leave when the colony was attacked by a battle squadron from the Razak Unity.  Apparently there is an on going war between these two groups.  With the help of our ship the Razaks were driven off and the colony suffered minimal damage.  The Listrania I required repairs to her hull and power systems before she was able to leave.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Listrania made contact with the Alliance home world and we have been invited to join.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We will begin construction of another exploratory craft based on design modifications of the Listrania I.  After extended periods aboard her the crew has many valid suggestions for improvements.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">58 Sarahabra, 1686 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After much debate in both the Tharthian and Zeltropian councils we have decided to join the Alliance.  I will be conveying this message in person so that we may work out suitable trade relations at the same time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It has been decided that we should construct several battle craft of our own.  The main reason being if the Razaks trace the Listrania I to us they might just attack outright.  The basic plans for the L I will be revised based on the experiences of the surviving warriors.  Weapon systems research will also begin to develop more effective systems.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">2 Garateal, 1686 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Upon emerging from hyperspace we were attacked by pirates.  We were able to subdue them and planned to take prisoners but they were able to self-destruct before we reached them.  Something about this entire encounter disturbs me but I can't pin down exactly what.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have met with the council of the Alliance and we have been accepted as members.  There are seven planets and ten colonies currently in the Alliance.  Contact and trade agreements have been reached with the Alliance.  I have also agreed to assist in the supplying of battle craft and fighters for the periodic conflicts with the Razaks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It is quite strange how similar we of Tharth and Zeltrop are to the other members of the Alliance.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">18 Sarahabra, 1692 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first battle craft, the Loraine I, has been completed.  Space frame and power plant systems checks have begun. Once the frame checks out we will install Alliance produced weapons systems. Part of the agreement between the Alliance and us is the exchange of technologies, including weapons. At this point we have little experience with starship weapons technologies.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">39 Garateal, 1692 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All tests have been successful.  The Loraine I has been delivered to the Alliance shipyards for weapons installation. Construction of another battle craft, the Tarkran, has now begun.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Dorienal, 1693 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Loraine I has passed weapons installation and testing and is assisting in patrolling Alliance space.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Trade between the rest of the Alliance and us is thriving!  Several general-purpose ships are being constructed to handle this new load.  The largest and fanciest is the Listrania III.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Information exchanged between our biologists and those of the Alliance show definite similarities.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="shields_1">(EnergyScreens Reference)</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Alliance has also provided information on energy shield units capable of producing "First" and "Second Order" screens.  First Order screens will stop heat transmission and Second Order screens will stop any or all wavelengths of visible light.  The light wavelengths to be stopped are electrically programmable by a small on-board controller.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They have also provided information on communication systems that will allow near instantaneous communication through hyperspace.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Sarahabra, 1694 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Tarkran is complete and has been placed in rotation with the Loraine I.  Work has begun on two more battle craft, the Loraine II and the Ozimandys.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">20 Garateal, 1695 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Razak Unity is suing for peace saying they are no match for the increased Alliance space force.  It has been noted that the Tharthian trained warriors are far better than the Razak crews.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is something about this turn of events that doesn't feel right but again I can't pin it down.  Something about the Razaks greatly troubles me...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Trade has increased even more with the promise of peace at last.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">45 Dorienal, 1695 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Razak peace envoy has arrived and the treaty signed.  Part of the agreement ensures visitations by people from all races as a gesture of goodwill.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first group will be made up mostly of ex-warrior personnel.  If anything goes wrong they are most likely able to take care of themselves until they can be released.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">6 Marahasal, 1698 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Relations with the Razaks are going exceptionally well.  Almost too well it seems.  Trade in knowledge and goods exceed everyone's imagination.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The only subject no one has found out anything about is what exactly the Razak "Onemind" is.  It is referred to in almost a religious sense.  Perhaps it is only a religious concept but it bodes ill.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several Razak embassies have been set up on all Alliance planets.  They have presented us with artworks and sculptures to beautify our planets and further the mingling of the arts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everyone who visits the Razak worlds speak glowingly of the peace and tranquillity of the Razak populace.  Relations within the Alliance are going very well also.  Yet even the long-term visitors know little or nothing of "Onemind".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several other Alliance worlds have begun trading sensitive technical information with the Razaks.  Tharth and us have so far avoided this practice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Research into the past of the Alliance indicates that they are remnants of an ancient galactic civilization.  This old Alliance apparently broke down from internal decay and only isolated colonies survived.  Perhaps we are descendants of that civilization.  Obscure legends say many different groups took small groupings of ships and dispersed throughout the galaxy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Analysis of the information given to several Alliance worlds in response to information given to the Razaks is sketchy at best.  We have tried to make anything useful from the data we have gotten second hand and have been unable to do so.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At first I put it down to just being second hand information with pieces held out of it, but I managed to gain access to the original information through a little computer hacking, and it was no more complete.  The information that planet sent to the Razaks though was quite thorough.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lauryl and I have strengthened our policy of no information trade and have begun trying to influence the other Alliance members to adopt similar policies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While experimenting with a process to strengthen hull metal for our starships the research group opened some type of space/time distortion.  They say they have brought into being a large bubble of some type of shimmering energy or material.  So far it has not been identifiable.  The researchers claim to have seen moving shapes within this sphere of theirs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several researchers from the hyperdrive team have gotten involved with the energy anomaly and think it may be controllable.  The principle two are Tomaril, our best hyperspace physicist, and his companion M'Lara, our best theoretical mathematician.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A first attempt was made to control the energy sphere this xer.  A volunteer was sent into it with a stripped down ship nav computer and a modified hyperdrive unit.  The poor guy was packed into a large ground vehicle with all the other stuff and lowered into the energy field.  The researchers are starting to call this thing the Well for some unclear reason, but since that is easier to say and input I too will refer to it as the Well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Apparently none of the equipment helped the volunteer get back.  He said it was totally non-functional when he "fell" out of the Well at a different place.  He says he got back by concentrating with his entire mind on home.  The research team is preparing another device.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">20 Dorienal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All Razaks have left saying disaster has befallen their home world and they must return.  It is strange that our ambassadors have said nothing of this.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The second Well control device was tested earlier this xer.  Apparently it was successful.  The volunteer reported landing in a field behind a small cluster of buildings.  When she ventured closer, the inhabitants emerged waving knives and pitchforks at her.  When she activated the return device she popped back out in the research station.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A Razak statue at a forest research site exploded, killing several people, and covered a half-zeem area in a grey gas when a worker attempted to move it.  Within 20 minutes all occupants were dead.  I sent Gareth Reital and a team of biochemists to check it out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have alerted the others of the Alliance.  They also have had no word from their people on the Razak worlds.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">31 Dorienal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Based on his preliminary findings Gareth and his team attempted to check another Razak statue for similar problems.  They were killed in an explosion and gas release when their test equipment set off some form of tamper switch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A second team had only started preliminary investigations before they got the word about Gareth's team.  They have a method for determining the presence of the gas and trap mechanisms that does not set off the traps.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">33 Dorienal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All other statues left by the Razaks have been checked and show signs of similar mechanisms.  It is not known whether they are set to activate at a set time or in response to a set trigger.  All Alliance planets are equipped with similar statues.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Biochemical analysis shows the gas to be a highly concentrated neurotoxin affecting only creatures capable of attuning thought crystal. The gas ties up the chemical receptors in nerve tissue and blocks nerve impulses. So far a way has not been found to neutralize this gas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The council has decided to carefully encase all statues in hull metal shielding and seal them up.  Calculations based on the two disasters have provided the thickness of hull metal sheeting that needs to be used.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have sent a full report of findings and actions to the other Alliance worlds.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">34 Dorienal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The placement of the hull metal shells started this morning.  Given the number of statues to contain the program should take 5 to 7 xers.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">41 Dorienal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All statues are now contained.  No one is very eager to attempt moving them in case any of the calculations are incorrect.  For the moment they will be left where they are.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">43 Dorienal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All other statues have exploded.  The hull metal shells seem to have contained the gas.  Word from the rest of the Alliance is the same.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Monitoring equipment has shown levels of the gas present in the areas around the containment shells after four hours had elapsed.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">44 Dorienal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tests by engineering personnel show the statues to contain an element that will break down hull metal.  The process cannot be halted once started.  They believe this element is too heavy to become airborne.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">45 Dorienal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The council is entertaining proposals on what to do now that we cannot contain the gas.  The two most promising are evacuation and Thermionic Suspension.  I personally favor evacuation since Thermionic Suspension could be dangerous over long periods of time.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">46 Dorienal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After much heated debate I managed to get the council to approve both plans, Suspension and Evacuation.  Construction of large sections of Suspension units will begin tomorrow and refitting of spacecraft will be done as the ships return from their current missions.  All ships capable of being recalled have been recalled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As many people as possible will be placed in Thermionic Suspension.  Construction of chambers will be supervised by Tamera Sarkarn with Jalana Kontril supervising preparation of people.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We will be evacuating to Karanal, one of the planets found by the Listrania II during one of her exploratory runs. The exploratory team reported a strange energy distortion in that area that we hope will provide a screen against Razak tracking and scanning systems.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A list of needed equipment and supplies is being prepared.  As soon as this is finished we will be issuing directives to coordinate production and stockpiling of essential materials.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Needless to say all other research and projects not directly related to this emergency have been shut down.  Since we do not know how easy it is for people or creatures to arrive through the Well we have designated that area a limited access area and sealed it off.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">56 Dorienal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The council has declared a state of emergency and decided that a single person could best coordinate the efforts. Unfortunately I have been given this thankless task.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All necessary production facilities have begun work on survival related supplies and equipment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The defense sites and systems developed during the Razak-Alliance war have been reactivated.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As Suspension units are completed non-essential people will be placed in them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Construction and refitting of ships has begun.  The Tharthians will borrow the Listrania III, which has just been completed.  Doriendal is instructing Lors, the commander of the Tharth military, on how to fly the L III.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">22 Tamer, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Current estimates give 40 Xers until the entire planet will be poisoned.  A combined team of biochemists has calculated the probable half-life of the gas to be about 700 zyrodyls.  In all events we have been aided by the slowing of the release of the gas by the containment experiment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lauryl has taken charge of the Tharth evacuation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All evacuees will rendezvous off the Alliance council world.  From this point we will proceed to various inhabitable planets, including Karanal.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">23 Tamer, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Doriendal and I have finished the designs for a smaller library computer capable of storing the information contained in the planetary system.  Three will be built, two for the evacuating ships and one for the colony on Karanal.  We designed these systems based on all thought crystal memory devices and optical computing processors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The computer systems on the Listrania III and Tarkran are being modified accordingly.

<p class="sectioncaption">24 Tamer, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first section of Suspension chambers has been completed and people are being prepared and stored.  Hopefully we will have enough time to complete all our preparations.  Current estimates give us about 35 more xers.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">31 Tamer, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Both moon bases are evacuating all non-essential personnel to the Tarkran.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Refitting of several other ships has begun.  Two freighters, a small passenger liner, and a research/medical ship are currently available here.  The Alliance is working on others.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something is missing, things seem too quiet and easy.  As a precaution both Lauryl and I have ordered our warriors to remain on full alert until the evacuation is complete.  We are both having patrols flown on a random basis as part of the alert.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everyone has been ordered to evacuate the polar research site.  Karena is resisting the order saying she needs to pack up a frozen corpse she found a couple of xers ago.  She says he strongly resembles "modern man" and is apparently clutching some sort of amulet.  This find will be crated and stored for study upon our return.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">32 Tamer, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Our alert status has been proven effective.  While I was coming back from an inspection of the work on the Tarkran a squadron of Razak fighters attacked.  We held them off but only because we were able to launch fighters quickly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Doriendal reports our long-range scanners were sabotaged, which explains why we did not detect the attackers before they were on us.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They did manage to destroy several asteroid mining stations.  Fortunately all but one of them had already been evacuated.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">33 Tamer, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Alliance ordered several battle craft to perform a diversionary strike against the Razak home world and their two nearest outposts.  Lauryl and I ordered our ships to destroy their home world if possible, if not, to cripple their fleet as much as they could.  Somehow one outpost was warned and our victory was very costly, however, the other two strikes were highly successful.  Maybe this will keep the Razaks busy while we finish our evacuations.  Reports from our crews indicate the complete destruction of the main Razak world.  One squadron attempted to take prisoners but as usual the Razaks managed to suicide before they could be captured.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">40 Tamer, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The battle craft from the Razak home world attack have arrived here for re-supply.  We have rotated our fighter crews and given them what we can.  Now they will engage in "guerrilla" fighting while we finish here.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Actual personnel evacuation has begun.  It looks like 1 million persons will be placed in Thermionic Suspension.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">41 Tamer, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two waves of fighters struck this xer.  It appears the diversions were not strong enough.  Casualties include 20 fighters and two outer alert bases.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hopefully the rest of the Alliance is faring better.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">42 Tamer, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All ships are full and we are leaving for rendezvous with the others of the Alliance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As a precaution against Razak invasion, the labyrinth has been sealed as have all the Thermionic Suspension sites (labyrinth seals have been placed behind the cat lair on level 2 so the cats will have access to outside).  The main computer system has been disconnected from all peripherals except the Suspension site control computers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hopefully the space around the council world will be empty so we may return for another load of survivors before the gas overcomes them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">People scheduled for the second load have been moved into the upper sections of the labyrinth and to the moon bases.  This should protect them if we don't get back as quickly as we hope.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">60 Tamer, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have met with the other survivors.  The situation is far worse than imagined.  There are surviving ships from only 5 planets and 3 colonies.  The total numbers of ships are 10 refitted and 12 unprepared.  Several other Alliance ships are unaccountably missing, no communications have been established and no distress calls received.  Of the surviving ships only three are battle craft, the Loraine II, the Ozimandys, and the Tarkran.  It has been decided that all ships will proceed to Karanal under the protection of the battle craft.  Given the current conditions there is no way we can go back for the second load at this time as Karanal is at least 100 xers travel from the Alliance worlds.  We have sent a message to the moon bases about our findings but have heard nothing in reply.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">61 Krena, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have encountered the strange distortion in hyperspace and have dropped to sub light drives to navigate through it. The survey team reported it was easier to make appropriate nav corrections in real space.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">65 Krena, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have arrived at Karanal and have begun off loading supplies and people.  This planet is very beautiful.  It has vast deserts outside small oases surrounded by large shielding rock walls.  Since we are in the void between the arms of the galaxy the only star visible is the one we circle and two faint bands of light from the galactic arms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A complex for research and storage of knowledge is being planned.  On scanning for a good site we came upon an oasis with a 0.5 zeem by 0.5-zeem platform three steps up from the surrounding area.  This platform is covered in light blue tile, 1 meter square, with a dark blue tile in the center with a gold arrow inlaid in it.  This is the only indication we have found that another civilization may have flourished on this planet.  We have decided to build our complex here as a memorial to that other race.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Microcircuits will replace thought resonant crystal for keys since it is not known if thought crystal will grow on this world.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">66 Krena, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During the off-loading procedures Kaya noticed some gibberish in a couple of computer files she was scanning.  Further checking showed massive damage to many data files.  At this time we have found no usable files in any of our systems.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An investigation by a team of computer and electronic engineers has shown the same problem in all computer systems, regardless of design or programming.  Much of the information lost was critical to our survival.  If we can find a way of shielding a system someone will need to return to an Alliance world and retrieve the information again.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">70 Krena, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After 4 xers of intense trial and error a shielding system has been found that works in short tests in the energy anomaly.  The ship that returns will do comprehensive checks when they reach the outer edge of the anomaly and will proceed only if the tests are satisfactory.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After much debate it has been decided two ships will make the run and they will attempt a direct path to Zeltrop from here.  The reason being all other planets had been heavily damaged by Razak attacks during evacuation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have attempted to contact the people we left behind on the moon bases but have had no luck.  The popular guess is no communication is possible through the energy anomaly.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">71 Krena, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At Zarn 16 Kayara and I departed aboard the Ozimandys to try and recover the required computer data, more supplies, survivors (if there are still any alive), and check for messages from the missing ships.  We are being accompanied by the Tarkran.</p>
