<p class="pagecaption">Kayara Diary</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">3 Marahasal, 1598 ALW to 12 Dorienal, 1599 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My sister, Lauryl, and I are twins, which in and of itself would not have been a problem, except that we were born into the royal family of Tharth and heirs to the throne. Tharth’s government is a matriarchal monarchy with heavy military overtones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My sister and I were the first born female children to our mother, the First Eldress of Tharth. Usually when twins are born one comes first and the other comes second, and in the case of the Royal family, someone keeps track of which is which. In our case we came premature and together.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mother always acted before thinking, so when she saw Aunt Kayalara about to be run over by a piece of crashing aircraft, she ran and pushed her out of the way. Well, mother did not get all the way clear and had a very crude cesarean, thus my sister and I were born simultaneously. At first the matter of succession did not come up as Mother survived her ordeal and it was questionable if we would.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We did survive and were both physically and mentally fit to rule, according to all the tests. We both passed every test they put to us with flying colors. We did not realize that there was a problem until we were around eight years old, and overheard some of mother’s advisors talking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We needed to find out the meanings of a few words and phrases that we had heard but did not understand. Being curious, bright young girls we talked it over and decided that as the library computer would log what we looked at, we would go to the old library where there were actual books (and to think that we actually thought the old place was a waste of space). Books are nice, they don’t log who reads them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After looking up the words we didn’t understand, we looked up our government’s history and who was eligible to sit on the throne and who decided. Well we found out that our situation had never happened before, and that we were both eligible. After days of discussing it we decided that we did not want anyone but us to pick who would succeed mother. We also looked up what ‘training and grooming for the throne’ meant, it sounded stuffy at best. So on our ninth birthday we announced that we wanted to decide which one of us succeeded mother ourselves.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To say we dropped a bomb shell would be an understatement. Mother wanted to know how, where, and when we had figured out we were in line for the throne. When we said we had just overheard two people talking in the garden a few months back, she wanted to know who. Judging from the look on her face heads would roll, and with mother that meant figuratively and literally, so we said we hadn’t seen them. Which was quite true except that we could identify them by their voices.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was decided that we would both begin being trained and groomed. I was right, it was stuffy at best and very boring. By the time we were sixteen, the age of maturity on Tharth, I had decided that I was not going to get stuck with sitting on the throne. Even if I had to stage a reverse political coup. I found out that near our eighteenth birthday the shuttle would be leaving for our sister planet, Zeltrop. I would catch it, and sort of exile myself to Zeltrop until my sister could cement her power.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When I told Lauryl, she was torn between the realization that it would probably be for the best and it could well be for the rest of our lives. As I told her then, "Just make sure you have a daughter quickly, that way no one will try to bring me back and put me on the throne." We decided not to tell anyone until a few days before I was due to leave.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To add confusion to problems, mother decided to retire on our birthday and she wanted me on the throne. So Lauryl and I had to break the news to her. To say mother was upset could be considered the understatement of the century. Worst of all the Planetary Council Advisors voted mother mentally unfit to rule. For years those of us in the immediate family knew it was coming, mother had been getting more and more unpredictable. Not a good thing in a ruler. The Council’s only power was to remove the First Eldress if she became unfit to rule.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I left admidst the turmoil. Lauryl and I had a wet leave taking, with luck she can visit me on Zeltrop in a few years when she makes her obligatory visit. She and I fixed my records so that my true identity would not be readily known. That way I would not run the risk of becoming a handle on her. We both are very good in computer manipulation.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">14 Dorienal, 1599 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My trip to Zeltrop was uneventful and boring, so I started writing this history/diary.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There were a couple of young men building some sort of airframe and power plant at the edge of the landing field when I arrived. From reading the news bulletins on the planetary computer net, I found out the two young men are called Eltaryn and Doriendal. They are working on building a better shuttle system.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Their system seems to call for differences in the ascent and re-entry phases of the flight profile and should result in better control and greater fuel savings. I have decided to get to know these two, maybe they can use a computer programmer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It will be hard to get into their circle of acquaintances, as the two of them are horrid workaholics. So I will look for work in a place where they will have to come sooner or later. With my training I should be able to take my pick of jobs around here.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">16 Dorienal, 1599 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Instead of testing to see what jobs you qualify for as it is on Tharth, here you test for what job will suit you. I spent most of the last two days having a battery of psychological and skill tests. At least they were accurate, I now have certificates to operate, program, and repair computers, as well as showing an aptitude for healing. I did not reveal the parapsychic skills I have. I have been offered my choice of computer jobs and I think I will work on overhauling the main planetary computer system.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Apparently this project is a constant on going project. Part is just cleaning out old data and maintenance and part is development and implementation of new hardware and software. Tharth has a few tricks that Zeltrop does not have and the reverse is also true.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">17 Dorienal, 1599 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My first day on the job and I found out that there is a new fuel source that is less toxic and more powerful. This must have been in the official packet of stuff that came to Tharth on the shuttle I left on. Due to the problems with mother, I did not get a chance to read any of it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Using this fuel, the new spaceframe is going to be even more efficient and powerful than I first thought.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zeltropians aren’t as trusting as I first thought they were. Most of the information I, as an unknown person, had access to was not accurate. I take that back, it was accurate, just not the whole story. I wonder whom the person is who wrote the code for this privacy system, they were quite good.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">24 Dorienal, 1599 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Even cleaning out old data files can be interesting. I found a personal diary from around 450 ALW. After reading it I decided that it should not be purged yet. I am not sure why, but I forwarded it to the First Elder. Now that I think about it, it is in his area of expertise, but a lower level person could have handled it. My psi is tingling like something prompted me to send it to him.

<p class="sectioncaption">35 Dorienal, 1599 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Met Doriendal today. He is the one that wrote the privacy code! So much for them needing a programmer. We talked for hours about programming, hardware, design, and everything. It is the most fun I have had since the last time my sister and I were together. He and Eltaryn are unattached at this time. Dal, as he is called by his friends, invited me to dinner with them tonight.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">36 Dorienal, 1599 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dinner was great, we talked a bit about the airframe and the fuel. Mostly we talked about ourselves and the differences between our two worlds. I think I’m in love or lust, I haven’t figured out which one yet.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">42 Dorienal, 1955 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The First Elder sent me a message thanking me for the diary, it was the diary of the First Elder at that time. He asked me to keep an eye out for more diaries and such written by previous First Elders. I think I like him, his message was very sincere.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Eltaryn, Dal, and I are together most of my free time. Most of the time it is at their work cavern a short way from the Gardens of Lazaar. They are both wrapped up in the design of the power plant for the new airframe.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Eltaryn has a nickname of Elkay. An Elkay is a brown short furred mammal native to Zeltrop, it has an exceedingly short temper. Dal uses the nickname more than the given and Eltaryn doesn’t seem to mind him doing so. But I saw where he got the nickname when someone he didn’t recognize as a close friend used it without his permission.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I like this Elkay, I think my twin would also, either she would like him or she would kill him.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">67 Dorienal, 1599 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I am enjoying myself here, although I do miss my family. I have found a place where I can practice the fighting dances, but I really need a partner to work out fully. No one here knows the Tharthian Fighting Dances, I am qualified to teach, but am uncertain if I should. I am getting a message sent to Lauryl to see what she thinks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The eatery that Dal, Elkay, and I frequent offered me a job as a regular dancer. I will think about it, as I have always danced just for my own entertainment, I am not sure if I would like to dance in front of a crowd of strangers. Dal and Elkay say that what ever I want is OK as long as I dance for them sometime.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">12 Krena, 1599 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dal and Elkay think they will be ready to test the full size model sometime next year. They are now fine tuning and checking to make sure they have not overlooked anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I seem to have hit a block with cultivating a relationship with Elkay, the work on the shuttle is taking up all of his time and thoughts. From what I have heard both he and Dal are not socializing at all, just working almost night and day on their design.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To give myself something to do I have taken up dancing at some of the local entertainment houses. It is more enjoyable than I thought. Lauryl responded to my message, saying the dance masters want to hold the fighting dances secret a while longer. Oh well, so much for that thought.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">12 Marahasal, 1599 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ever since I sent that diary to the First Elder, he has continued corresponding with me. I get the feeling that he knows who my family is. He also comes to watch me dance occasionally, when his work allows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His company is very soothing. He is a very good man, but of late he has been unwell. The doctors are worried, they cannot find out what is wrong other than old age (the joys of being a programmer with access codes).</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">80 Sarahabra, 1600 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tomorrow the experimental shuttle is to be tested. Elkay is acting funny, like he knows something and does not like what it is. Dal and Elkay randomized who would fly and who would run the ground test station. Elkay will be flying, but I get the feeling he cheated so that he would be the one.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">82 Sarahabra, 1600 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The shuttle crashed. The hydraulics failed after it left the atmosphere. Elkay is in the hospital in very serious condition. Only his family is allowed in to see him, but they are not here yet. Dal and I bullied our way with the medical team to the hospital, however we had to wait while he was in surgery. I finally got so tired of not being told anything that I leaned on the doctors and nurses until they let me in to see him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The First Elder requested that I come see him today whenever I am free. As soon as I write this to file I am off to see him.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">83 Sarahabra, 1600 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Well I know what the council stooly that was watching the tests was upset about. Elkay has been selected to be the next First Elder. The First Elder assured me that as far as he can see, Elkay will survive, but Dal wouldn’t have had he flown instead. That explains why Elkay rigged the contest for who would fly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The First Elder gave me a message for Elkay, in case he is unable to speak with him. It is to be given to him only if he decides to take the office.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The First Elder looked very old today. I hope Elkay regains consciousness soon. I fear the First Elder will not be with us for very much longer.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">3 Garateal, 1600 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The First Elder stepped down today, his health has totally failed. They don’t expect him to live to see the morning. This is the first time since the Last War that Zeltrop has been without a First Elder. The Council is very upset because Elkay has not regained consciousness and Marnek refused to name an alternate in case Elkay died.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Elkay’s family arrived on the first of Garateal. They say that Dal and I are allowed to see Elkay whenever we want or he wants us there. The doctors would like to argue, but one does not argue with Elkay’s mother and father. They work like a perfect team, almost like Lauryl and I do.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His mother gave me a scrutinizing look before making an issue with the doctors. Dal has been so upset feeling guilty about Elkay being hurt. Elkay’s mother put an end to that. She told Dal that Elkay rigged the draw and did so because Dal would have died had he flown and Elkay still would have been in the hospital. I am going to have to talk to someone about all these people knowing the future. I thought only we on Tharth had worked on developing psi.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">4 Garateal, 1600 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marnek died last night in his sleep. Elkay is still improving very slowly. How he survived is beyond me. From the looks of the crash as it happened and the remains I don’t see how he could have. One should not question the Powers I guess.</p>
