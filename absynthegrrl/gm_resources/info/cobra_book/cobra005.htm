<p class="sectioncaption">1 Sarahabra, 2402 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Given our figures of Immigrant spread we will have to begin placing sizable populations in about 5 zyrodyls if we wish to hold any area for our people.  This does not give us much time to find and fix the problems with the Revivees.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have moved a group of 75 Revivees to the cavern on level 5.  This group includes all the people we have full medical information on.  This way they are closer at hand for checks and tests.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Sarahabra, 2402 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have attempted to give our test group information on basic farming and animal husbandry using the brainscan unit.  So far they have shown no sign of this information.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">20 Sarahabra, 2402 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Our test group still shows no sign of initiative.  If the food bearing plants are ripe, they eat, if they find a dead or dying beast, they feast, but they will not attempt anything more strenuous.  Tomorrow we will try brainscanning 3 of them, looking at what is in their minds right now.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">21 Sarahabra, 2402 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The brainscans of the 3 samples show everything we saw last time plus the farming information we added on 10 Sarahabra.  There is no indication why they are not attempting to apply anything.  We would assume that this was because this group is in an easy environment except this condition is mirrored in the outside group.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have attempted to instill some sense of motivation into these 3 test subjects and will monitor how they behave tomorrow when we put them back.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">22 Sarahabra, 2402 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The 3 are showing some signs of initiative and are trying to get the others to do things.  We will continue to watch them to see how long this lasts.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">31 Sarahabra, 2402 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The three we tampered with have begun to show some initiative, at least among themselves.  One of them will always remain awake.  They share this duty among themselves but have been unable to get any of the others to participate.  They have shown a faint tendency to cultivate crops but can only get the others to follow like sheep.  We will program four more tonight as the original three are beginning to burn out.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">69 Sarahabra, 2402 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The seven programmed ones now have the others semi-organized, even though they still are very sheep-like.  So far the only observable side-effect of our tampering has been the formation of a "religion" around the worship of beings called Ancients.  Whenever they undertake any new action they pray to the Ancients for their guidance and blessing. The ones we tampered with explain their ideas as visions from the Ancients.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">15 Garateal, 2402 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The test group has not improved.  The seven still dominate the others and nothing gets done without their presence.  We will tamper with a few more this evening.  Hopefully we can find a working mix without having to tamper with all of them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The worship of the Ancients has continued to pervade all actions performed by the programmed seven.  We are reluctant to try tampering with religious beliefs at this point.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">40 Krena, 2402 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The minimum mix of tampered to non-tampered Revivees is 3 tampered to 1 not.  At these concentrations even the "nons" start to show a little self will.  Unfortunately the information we need next is what happens in the offspring.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">40 Marahasal, 2402 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Daran, a literary historian from the labyrinth survivors, has now identified most of the types of immigrants, mostly through legends and fairy tales.  There are many dwarves and elves, a few centaurs, ogres and hobbits.  We also have many "humans" but with eyes that have round pupils.   Sometime soon we must try for genetic samples and brainscans of these beings.  The results should be quite interesting.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">5 Dorienal, 2403 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We had a small group of immigrants arrive on level 7 this morning.  We were able to clear out of their path and close off our living areas.  So far they are poking around level 6.  If this is going to happen often we will need an intruder alarm and some way of tracking their movements.  Tabitha, moving very quietly and cautiously, managed to slip close enough to overhear them talking about finding a wizard, killing him and his minions, and taking his treasure.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">8 Dorienal, 2403 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This group of immigrants was a mix of 3 dwarves, 2 elves, and a "human".  We managed to surprise them with sleep gas, which fortunately worked on all of them.  Brainscans show varying levels of raw intelligence but a cultural background from a very low technology society.  Magic appears to be some type of study and concentration discipline capable of producing techno type results without technology.  It is a fascinating subject that will require more study.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Genetically there are very few differences between the elves and us.  If our results are correct they could mate with one of us (of appropriate sex) and produce viable offspring.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The "human" was the most interesting though.  The genetic differences between us and him were so small as to be almost nonexistent.  Unfortunately none of them really understand concepts about locations in a galaxy or star system.  The brainscan unit gave very little detail in its information because their culture is so different from ours.  We plan to brainscan as many immigrants as we can as they become available so we may collect more complete information on them.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">9 Dorienal, 2403 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The immigrants have been returned to the area where we found them.  We carefully tracked them until they re-entered the "gate" and disappeared.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">24 Sarahabra, 2405 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So far still no sign of the Karanal colonists.  They should have been back 4 to 5 zyrodyls ago.  Hopefully the Razaks weren't able to follow the Tarkran back and attack.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">60 Sarahabra, 2406 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still no sign of the Karanal colonists.  There have been no attempts at communication or anything else.  We hope they are still alive.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Garateal, 2409 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have exhausted all attempts to aid the Revivees.  The only technique that has had any lasting effect has been the brainscan enhancements.  With the immigrant population continuing to increase we feel we must revive the rest of the Suspended people.  As each group is revived we will subject each person to the brainscan enhancements and set them out in areas with hospitable conditions.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">24 Sarahabra, 2410 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have finally finished reviving and dispersing the last groups of Suspended people.  Now we will see how well they survive.  We have placed the Revivees on this continent as it has the lowest number of Immigrants.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">25 Sarahabra, 2415 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Studies of the children of our test group and two, easy to find, external groups show the children possess much higher levels of drive and curiosity than the parents.  This is true in all groups.  We will begin a policy of non-tampering until conditions force us to begin it again.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">42 Tamer, 2420 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Most of our time has been spent in continued monitoring of the Revivees.  Periodically 1 or 2 of us will check on the immigrants elsewhere but their numbers are fortunately not increasing as rapidly as they had been.  There is quite a village at the old city near the research station and at the other gate site on that continent, but they are the only populous gate sites.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">60 Garateal, 2430 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first group of children has grown almost to adulthood now.  They continue to show good levels of drive and motivation, we will continue to not interfere at this time.  As they have developed they have stimulated their parents slightly.  Most show good levels of caution and other survival skills.  Some have even managed to pry some basic plant and animal information from their parents.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The test group on level 5 is not significantly farther along than the others.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">45 Haralei, 2440 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Considering the problems that still face us and the low numbers of people we still have, I have asked Sharyl and Cassi to see if they can adapt the life prolongate effects of the Ankham flowers to us.  Cassi is very happy to be able to finally pursue that puzzle again. This way we can continue to research the changes to our people and attempt to prevent loss of our culture and knowledge.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">81 Dorienal, 2441 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After much experimenting we have found a serum which we hope will prolong our lives.  As yet we have no way of assessing the side-effects, other than immediate allergic reactions. Three of us died immediately from allergic reactions and two more died of complications several days later.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Krena, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still no communication from the Karanal colonists.  We were just about to try sending a message to them when Tyana intercepted a signal from a Razak monitor station to a battle headquarters reporting large amounts of activity on our world.  The returning signal indicated a survey crew was being sent to check on conditions.  It seems we will have to lie low for a while and put up what screening and camouflage we can to make it harder for them to detect our remaining technology.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">20 Krena, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just before sleeping last night I was thinking about how to hide our technology, some other way than by having to shut it down.  As I drifted towards sleep I felt drawn toward a mind place that felt as if it contained answers.  I had dimly felt this place before, usually when going to sleep with a particularly difficult problem.  In the past sleep claimed me before I could really perceive this place.  This time I was awake enough to guide my awareness toward it.  It seemed to be a long dark "hole" reaching down out of "sight" but filled with little "windows" of memories.  Those near the top were mine, I'm not sure about the ones further down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This morning I awoke with the desire to go investigate several of the brainscan library cubes.  The strange thing with this library is the more you learn the more you can find in it.  I'm sure there is a limit but we haven't found it yet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I found information that allowed us to modify the energy screen technology from the Alliance to make the screens block the entire electromagnetic spectrum instead of just the heat and light portion of the spectrum.  I also found a technique that allows tuning of the screens to pass whatever frequencies of the EMR spectrum the operator desires.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The actual generating equipment for these screens is relatively simple so we will be able to install them wherever we need/want them.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">30 Krena, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I managed to relax enough to get back to the inner "hole" just before sleep last night.  This time I could manage to look through any of my own memories I desired, from present back to the time of evacuation.  With better control, and a little less fatigue, I should be able to get even deeper into my past.  The hardest part of this is getting relaxed enough without going to sleep.  Maybe if I tried before getting so tired.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">33 Krena, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tried this morning before leaving to continue screen installations.  I was doing well until one of the cave cats jumped on me wanting to play.  When I "snapped back" to here I saw the cat sitting in the doorway just watching me.  I had the distinct impression the cat had not actually jumped on me but had just been sitting and watching.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">38 Krena, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">From now on I will refer to this mind "hole" as the Core of Being, why I don't know, it just feels right.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is the first time I have been able to get into the Core of Being for a long time.  Access has not become harder, just no time to relax and try.  I tried to move around in Doriendal's memories but found I could only easily get into those we both participated in.  I tried to access a stranger's memories but found no common reference for entry.  It seems there should be a way around this since the memories are semi-visible to me.  I will have to keep trying.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">65 Krena, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tyana has spotted a Razak ship on long range sensors.  It will arrive in three xers.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">67 Krena, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have just finished installing screen units in all active locations and cleaning up after ourselves.  Hopefully we have removed any signs of our technological activities.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At last I was awake enough to try the Core again. This time I managed to go deeper in and found I could access Doriendal's memories.  I found my way into his perceptions during part of the evacuation.  A definite danger is not being able to get back!  I almost found myself trapped in his frame of thought. The only thing that clued me to the danger was when I viewed something we had both done but something didn't feel quite right. It felt almost like something was pulling on me. I concentrated on the pull until I felt better and found myself back in my own reference frame. One must have a very clear sense of self when looking through someone else's memories.  Still the Core stretches on down though.  I wonder how far back I could go?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Coming back out I had an odd experience, it seemed as if a large cat was walking beside me.  When I opened my eyes I saw a cave cat in the doorway watching me.  He gave a twitch of his tail, almost like a salute, and pranced off down the corridor.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">68 Krena, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Razak ship has arrived but so far is only doing orbital surveys.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Haralei, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was able to access a stranger's memories but only saw still images of one or two major events.  At least these were clear.  Now I can see many more lighted "windows" stretching away into the darkness of the Core.  It seems I have taken another small step forward.  It seems once I have accessed the memories of a person I have had contact with I can then "see" memories belonging to people they know.  When this happens even more lighted "windows" appear in the Core.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">69 Haralei, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have continued to access different memories, those I have a common reference point with I can move around a little.  Those I do not have a common reference with I still see only still images of one or two significant events.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I get the feeling there are other things the Core of Being can be used for but as yet I have no idea what.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">40 Marahasal, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tyana reports that the Razaks do not plan on landing any time soon but will leave orbiting probes spaced so as to keep a tight net of surveillance.  The actual survey ship will be leaving in 2 or 3 zerads.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">43 Marahasal, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So far the Razaks still remain in orbit, their only communications being reports on planetary conditions.  They have shown little reaction to the presence of the Revivees or the immigrant life forms. We are hoping their only interest is in assessing technology and threat levels.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">44 Marahasal, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Another Razak ship has arrived to assist the current ship.  Tyana reports both will remain in orbit for several more xers before leaving.  She was unable to understand all of the information transferred but believes the second ship is looking for something specific.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">69 Marahasal, 2450 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Razaks have finally left after extremely intensive planetary scans. Tyana believes they were unable to locate whatever it was the second ship is looking for. The number and types of orbiting probes has been seriously upgraded from their original plans.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">35 Sarahabra, 2451 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have managed to move around a little in a stranger's memories.  The process consists of entering the still image and concentrating on becoming the one whose memories I want to follow.  I managed to move a little forward in my target's memories.  With more practice it feels like I will be able to eventually wander easily through any memories I can access.   When I returned and opened my eyes a large cat pounced on me from the doorway and we wrestled around for a few minutes before he left.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">60 Sarahabra, 2451 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had better success with the Core of Being last evening.  This time I was able to merge in, move easily through some of the more vivid memories, and return.  So far all my experimenting has been with people who would be dead by now.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">80 Tamer, 2451 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wish it were easier for us to get out and about.  We need to find out how the other groups are managing and if they have had any contact with Immigrant groups.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">20 Krena, 2451 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was able to tap into the memories of one of the Karanal colonists and found out they had been attacked 30 zyrodyls after arrival.  Many managed to escape but they were forced to flee away from this section of the galaxy.  After long traveling there was a disagreement over where to stop.  An inhabitable planet had been found.  The person whose memories I was tracking and several ships stayed there.  Three other ships kept going.  Conditions on landing were crude and many died of disease and exposure.  When the person I was following died he was not sure if any of the remaining survivors would remember to return after 700 zyrodyls.  This explains why no colonists have returned from Karanal.  Tonight I will try to find out what happened to the other three ships.  This news has depressed us all.  We must be successful with the Revivees to ensure our continuity.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">21 Krena, 2451 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One ship landed on the next inhabitable planet they encountered.  The gene pool was very small since the other two ships went on.  Searching farther into the memories of the people that stayed this time showed they soon forgot their past and developed a very low tech society.  Some type of mutation seems to have removed their offspring from the Core of Being as I can find no other memories dealing with that particular group.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">22 Krena, 2451 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The other two ships traveled far beyond our galaxy and arrived at another galaxy.  There was some damage to one of the ships, enough that it crashed on an already inhabited planet.  None of the survivors was certain whether the damage was from sabotage or crossing between galaxies.  The survivors of the crash and the crew of the other ship stayed and mingled with the struggling indigenous life forms.  The survivors managed a crude bit of genetic engineering to make it possible to interbreed, however the offspring had only sporadic access to the Core of Being.  The hybrid offspring seem to have flourished but forgotten most of their past.  I found several offspring who had a few memories I could locate and examine.  Something about that planet's position and conditions has stirred something in the depths of the Core of Being, I can't seem to get to it or find out what it is yet, though.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Tamer, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Another group of immigrants has appeared on level 7.  This time one of their number was a magic user, sometimes called an Arcane because of their use of "arcane" arts (I will use arcane because it takes less time to enter).  Brainscans of this individual have proven very interesting.  We are still interpreting the results but preliminary findings point toward a highly developed psychic ability.  This ability seems to allow energy to be drawn and formed by various procedures to produce various desired results.  The procedures are a form of visualizing energy patterns which when directed and finished produce the results.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Krena, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The last analysis of the arcane's brainscans have led to a partial understanding of the magic procedures.  Each "spell" or pattern producing a specific result must be learned by intense study of either magic books and writings or from an arcane that already knows the "spell".  Each spell consists of several distinct sections, the first section prepares the arcane's awareness and concentration allowing him to visualize the energies used to create the desired pattern, the second section is the "weaving" of the actual pattern using the psychic power of the arcane himself, the third section of the spell is where any additional external energy is drawn in and focused (additional personal energy may be needed in this step to control the additional energies drawn in dependent on quantity), the fourth (and final) section is the directing or targeting of the spell so that the results are where and when the arcane desires.  Apparently spells are taught as a complete pattern to the new arcane and only as his skill and capabilities grow is he able to figure out how to change the amount of external energy he draws in for spells with variable levels of effect.  Often external items, called material components, are used to help focus and aid in concentration on specific spells.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">20 Krena, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">More and more it becomes important to find out about the Immigrants.  We must get some of our people into one of their villages, ideally the one with the temple near the "gate".  Marek and Sandi (Marasandra) will scout the area tomorrow for an idea of what will be required.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">22 Krena, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marek and Sandi report the area is very rough.  Fights are common among the villagers, usually over women or money.  Most battles involve knives, swords, or similar short range weapons, although some battles are magical in nature.  They recommend that anyone attempting to stay in the area be well versed in weapon and non-weapon combat.  Based on this report I have asked Tyana and Marek to put together a hologram training tape for this type of combat, using any information they can find.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">24 Krena, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaya has volunteered to assist Marek and Tyana with the training tape.  She figures it is no longer necessary to conceal the fact she is the twin of the Tharth First Eldress and her knowledge of the Tharthian fighting dances.  She had originally been selected as the twin to assume power but she and her twin decided it would be the other way.  She fled for here before this information could be found out.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">26 Krena, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After studying the brainscans we had from the "visitors" to level 7, Tyana,  Marek, and Kaya have put together hologram training programs to teach basic unarmed and armed combat skills.  After that we will need to practice against each other to get a better feel for the techniques.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">29 Krena, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Looking at the two tapes we have decided to start with the unarmed combat first.  Marek's combat training and Kaya's fighting dance training will enable them to assist the rest of us with these techniques, we believe it will be easier to add weapons techniques to the unarmed skills.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These holo tapes are the first time any of us have seen how Tyana perceives herself, she is five foot ten inches tall with a slender supple build.  She has grey eyes and a mane of curly chestnut hair reaching her shoulders.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">69 Krena, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As an experiment I attempted to use the Core of Being to speed learning.  It has worked!  I am fairly proficient now with simple unarmed combat techniques while the others are learning much more slowly from the training tapes alone.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">71 Krena, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have finally mentioned the Core of Being to the others and had them try to simply gain access to it.  Kaya had reasonable success as did Sharyl.  None of the others had any luck.  The biggest difficulty is being able to relax enough, yet stay awake.  Cassi and Sharyl have decided to try and develop a potion for relaxing the others.  Kaya says the discipline from dance helped her, Sharyl just seems to have the knack for it.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">2 Haralei, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So far any attempts at memory access have been people of the same generation or later.  The feeling I get is that I have just touched the edge of the Core, if I were to follow it down I wonder where it would end? The brainscans of the immigrant arcane have started me wondering what other powers the Core of Being can provide.  It is said knowledge is power.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">27 Haralei, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cassi and Sharyl have finished a relaxant/enhancer that seems to help focus the mind on the Core of Being.  This has helped the others gain limited access.  Kaya and Sharyl have been practicing on their own and are now fairly proficient at accessing the upper areas.  Both are having trouble accessing the memories of strangers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The process was not without tragedy though. Two of us somehow lost themselves in the Core, several days later their bodies died. I could find no trace of them when I tried to help them back. I am at a loss to explain what happened, all I can do is urge caution in the future.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">62 Haralei, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The others are becoming fairly adept at accessing memories of known people.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Earlier I accidentally accessed some of Kaya's memories.  I was watching her practice dancing when I slipped into a sort of trance.  Next thing I knew I was seeing the time I first saw her dance, but through her eyes.  It was very special being able to feel what she felt and thought.  Next thing I knew I "awoke" to find her watching me. "I thought you called me" was all she said.  I have never felt as close to her as I do now.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">72 Haralei, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaya and I tried an experiment, the results of which have been startling.  We both accessed the Core of Being and concentrated on our first time of making love, but concentrated on the other's point of view.  Suddenly we were in some type of mental link, I could "talk" to her and she could "talk" back.  Talk is nowhere near the right word, the communication was more a sending of images and impressions than a sending of words.  We were able to see things from the other's point of view merely by thinking about it.  When we ended the experiment a residual feeling of togetherness remained.  The effect did not seem to change with distance but faded slowly with time.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">7 Marahasal, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Periodically Kaya and I have tried to establish contact.  At first we had to follow our original procedures, but lately it has gotten to where we only have to relax and think of the other one.  Each time we succeed the residual feeling is a little stronger and continues for a longer time.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">8 Marahasal, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Last night Kaya and I were in contact with each other, exploring parts of the Core when the large cat appeared again.  This time he seemed to lead us toward a specific "window" and pointed his paw like he wanted us to look at this one.  This "window" was into the memories of Lauryl, Kaya's twin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaya was easily able to gain access and through her so was I.  We followed the memories to their end.  She was in one of the two ships that journeyed beyond our galaxy.  She was in the ship that did not crash and had just sent a message warning of sabotage when the other ship ran into trouble.  She also knew of several "accidental" deaths after the crash and several attempts to prevent their return.  She managed to foil several but died not knowing if she had stopped them all.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">12 Marahasal, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Last night we tried another experiment, we began love making and attempted to contact each other at the same time.  The results were beyond all our imagining, not only could we feel our own responses but those of each other as well.  Each response was magnified by the response of the other until we could no longer tell which feelings belonged to which one of us.  Our peak left us semi-conscious and linked together as almost a single being.  As we slowly awoke we began to realize our separate identities again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The residual feeling is now almost a full contact, as it has been ever since last night.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">13 Marahasal, 2454 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The residual feeling is still as intense as yester xer and shows no apparent fading.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">12 Sarahabra, 2455 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The combat training is going very well.  Most of us are proficient in unarmed combat and at least one weapon type.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marek, Sandi, and Daran left to-xer for the temple village.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">27 Sarahabra, 2455 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaya and I are able to contact each other over long distances.  I was checking on conditions on the other side of the planet from her and contact was still easy to establish and maintain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaya has suggested we try these experiments with Sharyl.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">47 Sarahabra, 2455 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The experiments have worked extremely well with Sharyl also.  Now the three of us are able to "converse" over long distances without need for comm gear.  We still need to be careful of the other person's privacy since it is very easy to search too far down or think about too much too quickly for the other person to absorb.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The group in the Immigrant colony has found that so far all arcanes are arriving already trained.  A few have begun to accept apprentices but no actual teaching arcanes exist here yet.  Anyone seriously interested is sent back into the Well to pilgrimage for training.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">12 Krena, 2460 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The life prolongate may be working.  None of us seem to have aged as much as would be expected.  So far we can detect no obvious effects.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Haralei, 2464 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marek, Sandi, and Daran are all doing well in infiltrating the Well temple village. Sandi has done the best, managing to win her way into the high priestess personal guard squadron by using her combat training. This is definitely a tribute to the work done by Tyana, Marek, and Kaya. The fighting dance sequences from Kaya apparently were the crowning touch to her "trial by combat" tests.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marek is working as a trainer at the local mercenary guild hall and Daran has a place with a ranking sage in the main village.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Garateal, 2465 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sandi has returned from the Immigrants city and reported an attack on the temple and residents.  The attackers apparently came from the gate, which the priestesses now call "The Well".  The priesthood managed to defeat the attackers with the survivors fleeing into the Well. We still are not sure how the priesthood had opened the complex around the gate in the first place.  We think maybe they emerged from the gate and managed to figure a way around the locking systems. Sandi remembers hearing vague references to techno's, adventurers apparently somewhat proficient with some forms of technology.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This situation has pointed out a need to investigate any of our research areas that still remain.  After recovering all the information we can we will remove any sensitive or dangerous items and close down the sites.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I still feel there is more to know about these gates.  Tonight I will try to go deeper into the Core of Being.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">5 Garateal, 2465 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sandi has returned to the Immigrant city to resume her duties. She promises to return when she can with further reports.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Sarahabra, 2467 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tomaril and M'Lara have gone off with a small group to continue technical research they had started before the Evacuation.  We are to "call them if we really need them..."</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">67 Krena, 2467 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One of the technicians at Tomaril's research facility called for medical aid for Tomaril to-xer.  When an emergency crew arrived on the scene they found Tomaril seemingly dazed and rambling on about an experiment to travel through dimensions and time using a modified hyperdrive unit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When we finally pieced together everything that had happened it seemed he and M'Lara had tried some type of experiment a few xers ago that hadn't worked quite right.  M'Lara was seen to be in extreme pain after that  experiment, and then was missing entirely to-xer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tomaril was confused and vague after the experiment and distraught that M'Lara had "wondered off" this morning.  No amount of questioning revealed any additional details other than the hyperdrive unit they had been experimenting with was also missing.  Tomaril was accusing everyone of having stolen it.  Nothing short of a sedative would calm him down.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">69 Krena, 2467 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tomaril's condition has not improved.  He is now convinced M'Lara ran off with one of the Immigrants from a nearby village.  He is convinced that I have confiscated his hyperdrive unit and am conspiring behind his back to rob him of his successes.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">71 Krena, 2467 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have tried everything we can think of to convince Tomaril his imaginings are just that and to see if he knows any more about what actually happened to M'Lara.  Sharyl even used the brainscan unit on him.  No changes or aides that she implanted have taken hold.  The brainscan has not been able to access any memories that will tell us anything either.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">72 Krena, 2467 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have attempted to access Tomaril's memories using the Core of Being.  I have found out what happened during his and M'Lara's last experiment, they had removed many of the safety systems of the hyperdrive unit and programmed it to shift into dimensions specified by alterations to the entire space/time coordinate system but it seems there must have been errors in the equations defining the coordinate set.  When the unit was activated the entire lab appeared to "melt, stretch, and deform" with large black gaps and voids appearing in it.  Then there was a feeling like something slamming into his mind, then a wall of searing pain.  Suddenly it surrounded me and I began to fragment, pieces of myself melting and flaming away.  Beyond the wall I could see nothing...  I came out of it screaming, at least that is what they tell me, as I immediately collapsed into a dreamless sleep for the next five hours.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">75 Krena, 2467 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaya has attempted to locate M'Lara to see if she can figure out where she is or if she has died.  She is not dead but access to her is blocked by the same walls of pain I experienced.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">72 Marahasal,2469 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tomaril has been observed for quite some time now and except for his disorientation does not seem much the worse for wear. We have returned him to his living areas with a med-tech to keep an eye on him.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">2 Garateal, 2469 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have reached a block in the Core of Being.  I can see it stretching further down but I seem unable to progress any farther than the point of my birth.  For some reason I have remembered Sandi mentioning a ritual used by the priestesses of the Temple of the Well.  She was not certain what it was for but remembered one of the results was a deep trance-like state in which the affected person talked of many visions of themselves and their children.  I feel I must investigate this further.</p>
