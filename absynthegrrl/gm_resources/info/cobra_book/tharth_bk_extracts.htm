<p class="regtxt5">page 2010</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Our planet was being attacked by poisonous gases, we had to evacuate in fear our race would be wiped out. Both Tharth and Zeltrop were in danger. We fled, hoping to draw the enemy away and then to escape them. We were divided on the approach to our safety. Some were placed in cold sleep, to await a time after the gas broke down. We are the others, the ones sent out into the void to seek a legendary world and the defenses found there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We had found the legenedary world, still shrouded by the electro-magnetic energy cloud that had been createdin its last days. Wethought we were safe behind the barrier, and for a time we were.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">page 2020</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The enemy found a way through the barrier. At first we considered it might be luck, but then unexplained failures started occuring in other places. Investigation by trusted persons revealed a web of sabotage. We were faced with the reality of traitors in our populace, something few would have believed. No one can answer the question of why anyone would seek the destruction of their own people. It is unthinkable to those of us on the council of advisors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Our arrival was filled with disaster, the LII crashed, killing most of her passenger and crew. Elentaryn died shortly after the crash from his injuries. Kayara has taken over his duties for now.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first order of business is the construction of living areas and food production. Some of the equipment we had in the LIII will help, although we are short all the LII cargo.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">(detail return plans - tech site, ship parking, artifacts to stimulate implanted memories, etc.)
LIII parked in asteroid field,  a secure site was constructed and filled with surviving equipment and information, genetic experiments for adaptation and ‘race memory’ were started, results were completely unknown - if it worked, cool! Otherwise….</p>

<p class="regtxt5">morrocotal is not a tech so his descriptions need to be non technical in nature.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mando - 3 - 2 (1220 AD)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is unfamiliar to our minds. This is the earth’s counting system. This day is the day we landed on this planet. Our planet was being attacked by poisonous gases, we had to evacuate in fear our race would be wiped out. Both Tharth and Zeltrop were in danger so we found ourselves on this planet. We will have to stay here seven centuries, long enough for the gases to break down and neutralize. </p>
