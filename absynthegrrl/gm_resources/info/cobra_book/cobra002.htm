<p class="sectioncaption">I, Merrilan, accept position of First Elder on the 2nd xer of Garateal in the 4th zyrodyl ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I am not too sure what it is I am suppose to record here.  Morietal said that he has run out of words for this part of his job.  He seems to have covered all of the high points of the last few zyrodyls.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Between this ring and the information found at the Thought Crystal Gardens we have survived better than any of us could imagine.  Tharth is surviving as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We are reclaiming more and more land.  The wild animal populations are coming back.  There are a few mutations in every specie of plant and animal, ours included.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Dorienal, 5 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The redesigning of the computer is finished, and the work has been started.  The processor is being upgraded to handle multiple users and to make it faster.  I do not quite understand all that is being done, computer hardware was never my strong point.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Exploration of the moons is being planned.  If all goes well with that we will look into mining them.  I wish we could make more fuel but we are limited not only by the toxic waste but also the raw materials.  Unless we find raw materials on the moons or find a new type of fuel that uses different raw materials we are soon going to have no more rocket fuel.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Tamer, 6 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have had to limit the number of rocket launches to two a zyrodyl.  The planet was not detoxifying as well as it was originally thought it would.  The moons are looking promising.  As soon as the last report is in we will decide if we will build a refinery on one of them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The computer is doing well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">More new uses for the Thought Crystal are being found each zerad it seems.  It is strange, we sent some to Tharth but it will not grow there.  The First Elder's ring is the only ring that can be attuned by more than one person.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Krena, 7 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A new way of refining rocket fuel has been discovered.  It gives out less toxic wastes and a purer fuel.  This will allow us to set up a refinery on the red moon.  We can get almost all we need from the two moons, and with this new technique we will be able to ship the one ore from the planet up with no difficulty.  This new way also uses less fuel per trip.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tharth has gotten a Space Station up with our help.  Tharth is now a viable colony, if something should happen to our shuttle system they could survive.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Haralei, 8 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Population growth has been slow and steady.  It has taken a long while for the average person to get used to the new ways of doing things.  But on the whole I believe that most are happier now than before the war.  If nothing else there are no taxes and no need for a police state.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The major law is to take responsibility for ones own actions and the actions of ones under age children.  Privacy violations are the worst crimes so far, ever since that first zyrodyl people are very defensive of their privacy.  Of course we do not have that many laws, and the religion of Ertan is a very practical religion.  Most of the people follow the teachings of Ertan now.  Rabid types are non-existent, now.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Marahasal, 9 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We are starting to prepare for the 10th anniversary of our survival.  Most people have houses instead of caves now, except those who like living in caves.  The social structure has stabilized, medicine is at a never before seen high, over all we are doing well.  Social emphasis is on a good life for all instead of a good life for me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">People are tested for what will fulfill them and society.  Education stresses learning not grades.  I think this new structure is more viable than the old.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The word that best sums up our new society is moderation.  Things are not as rushed as they were before the War.  Definitely things have slowed down to a more reasonable pace from the first couple of zyrodyls after the War.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tharth is doing well, at least that is what they say.  We take their word for it as only the Shuttle pilot makes regular visits.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">6 Sarahabra, 10 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The celebration was a big success, it was two full weeks of festivals starting the last week in the old zyrodyl.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Garateal, 11 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The scientists say that our weather patterns are starting to calm down into predictable patterns.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thank goodness we were able to get a major power source so soon after the War.  We never would have made it without the military computer and its emergency power supply.  The Thought Crystal Garden and all that knowledge would have been lost forever.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For medical reasons we are now giving every newborn baby its own Thought Crystal.  It makes running tests so much quicker, surer, and painless.  Most everyone has a ring now.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We keep trying to figure out how to grow them anywhere other than the Gardens, but so far no luck.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Dorienal, 15 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We are mining the moons now.  Another solar ship was built to explore the solar system.  Life is too precious to not spend it learning.  Of course the range of the Explorer is not its energy source but its food supply.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Population growth is still on schedule, as is reclaiming the areas damaged by the War.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Our computer science is our most rapid growth field, followed by medicine.  Environmental Resources is the third most advanced, with Space Technology running a close fourth.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Tamer, 25 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I feel that the biggest threat to our planet is complacency.  We are getting a little too relaxed.  There is a strong possibility that the lack of competitiveness could do what over competitiveness failed to do...be the end of our race.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rapid advancements in our technologies has come to almost a complete stop, but the art fields are starting to take off.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Krena, 40 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was a near thing, but we are still here.  Martial arts and sports saved the xer.  The Shuttle people got this brainstorm of having sport competitions between the different regions here on Zeltrop and for our champions to meet Tharth's once every five zyrodyls.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Our first solar system meets were held last zerad, half the meets were on Tharth and half here on Zeltrop.  There was 10 events total, we won 4 of the events on Tharth and 2 of the event here.  So much for the home planet advantage.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Haralei, 55 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Looking back, maybe we were not stagnating but just slowing down.  We had made such major advances so quickly after the War, it makes normal advancing seem slow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All is going real well.  No major catastrophes or high points either, just steady smooth sailing.  I guess that we are now cementing our social structures and laws.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">I, Karenal, accept position of First Elder on the 1st xer of Marahasal, 60 zyrodyl ALW</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Sarahabra, 81 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Our useful life span has lengthened.  Before the War when the life span went up it meant that one had a longer "old age", now the middle zyrodyls are what are lengthening.  Most of the problems of old age, have been solved (senility, arthritis, etc).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The knowledge gained from the Thought Crystal Garden has really saved us a lot of grief.  The radiation did a lot of damage to our genes, at first we could only identify the damaged genes and not let that person breed if it was the type to cause problems for the offspring.  Then it was figured out how to repair some of the damage so that it would not be passed on or jeopardize the child.  The Thought Crystal made this so much easier.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Archeological research continues into life before the Last War but so far not much has been determined. The survivors of the holocaust did not bother to record anything about the conditions before the War.  The only sites that look promising are the ones that were too badly radiated to be scavenged.  There was a site called  "Continental Defense Command" but it was heavily raided for parts and equipment, all that is left is lots of ruined control equipment parts.  Whatever records were left at the site have been destroyed by exposure.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Dorienal, 426 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We are beginning a system of transit which we hope will eventually span the planet.  This system consists of magnetically propelled vehicles traveling in subsurface evacuated tunnels.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Garateal, 513 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Work on the world transit net is continuing at a rapid pace. Those sections already installed are working even better than was anticipated!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It is a pity that during the transfer ceremony the last First Elder only shows the initiate the Thought Crystal Gardens on level seven.  The tunnel system is huge!  These tunnels seem to be very old, I wonder how far they date back before the Last War.  They seem to have been melted through the rock with some sort of high temperature device.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Marahasal, 1510 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In my spare time I have taken to wandering some of the areas. The other xer I found the underground council chamber that must have been used either before the Last War, or right after.  It is located on the level just below the entry cavern.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Go through the "Paths of Confusion" by staying on the right until you pass an "s" curve and come to a place with a passage to the left, followed rapidly by a door on the left, take the passage to the left.  You then follow that passage, ignoring all side doors and branches until you come to a "T", turn right, then right, then pass one, then turn left and open the door.  This council also had seven members, similar to ours.  When I suggested meeting down there the other council members seemed disturbed, as though the place was cursed or something.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Garateal, 1521 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have found a secret hiding place near the Thought Crystal Garden, it contains a machine that can teach and read what is stored in the brain.  I have found stored in one of the cubes the diaries of the first few First Elders, I am going to put them into a Book of First Elders.  I think I will keep the brainscan unit a secret for the time being.  We could have learned so much more from this equipment and the information that is stored here, I wonder why it was hidden away and forgotten.  Maybe someone forgot to tell somebody about it.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Dorienal, 1553 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have found some information dealing with spacecraft fuel refining, I have forwarded it to the proper people.  I will just say that it came to me one night in a vivid dream.  First Elders are known to have true dreams and hunches occasionally, so questions won't be asked.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Tamer, 1563 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It would have been nice if the other First Elders had kept up with the diary writing, like our fore fathers wanted.  Oh well, maybe somewhere in the computer are their private diaries.  If someone finds them I hope they will put those diaries in with these others.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">2 Haralei, 1589 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finally someone is starting to seriously look at the information on that fuel formula.  It took these people long enough to get interested.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">15 Dorienal, 1592 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two young men have been brought to my attention, they were working on redesigning the rockets to use solar power to lift off and fly as high as that method would allow before cutting in the rocket engines.  Then one of them cracked into the computer section holding the private research notes on the new fuel.  They scrapped their project and started working on an entirely new system.  These two are just what we as a people need; drive, curiosity and imagination.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Marahasal, 1599 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The ring is showing me things I cannot quite understand.  I can recognize my successor but I do not understand what is going on around him.  Or even if it is the now or the possible future.  I am going to have to retire soon, my health is failing rapidly, I do not think that the Council will like the one who has been chosen to follow me.  He is so young and impatient with fools.  It did not take him and his friend long to start building a ship that would take advantage of the new fuel source.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">81 Sarahabra, 1600 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It has been 1600 zyrodyls since the War and we still capitalize the word.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I just found out that my candidate for First Elder just crashed his experimental space frame.  He will live, even though the Council does not believe he will, and keeps pressuring me to name another.  He is my choice, my one and only choice, I can make no other, our people will need him soon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The doctors will not let me see him as he is still out of it.  The young girl from Tharth is allowed in to see him.  Both the ring and I like her, she is strong but flowing, like a river.  I am making an appointment to see her tomorrow, as I am not going to be here when Elentaryn comes to.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I will also try to leave a message in the ring for him, but just in case it does not work that way, I am seeing her.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">I, Marnek, relinquish position of First Elder to the Council until a new First Elder can be selected on 3rd xer Garateal, 1600 ALW</p>
