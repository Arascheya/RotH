<p class="pagecaption">Kayara Notes on the recent times</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* before the time of Shandi and current events */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../npcs/sharyl.htm">Sharyl</a> and I have noticed more and more that Elentaryn is slipping into madness. He sits for longer and longer times just staring into the monitors of the Labyrinth. He has started to mumble to himself about enemies of the people and setbacks in his plans to recreate the Zeltropian paradise.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have broken the mind link we once shared with him. We had to, it was driving us mad as well. I think time is catching up to him. How long can you live and not have it wear you down?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sharyl has the School of Magic and the learning and perfecting of the Arcane Arts to keep her going. I am taking great fun in pushing events in new and strange ways. Elentaryn doesn't allow himself any releases. He sits in the Labyrynth and broods, like a giant spider at the center of a frayed and tangled web. He bemoans the fact no one comes here any more. But that's not true. The adventurer family is still here and still vibrant. The employees are here, squabbling, fighting, and carrying on as always. If he could just let himself get involved with the glorious chaos of the world around him. Instead he wants to force a return to something that never really existed in the first place.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There were crimes in his perfect world. People died in strange and wrong ways. Our own daughter led a protest against the council and him shortly before the great evacuation and still he clings to the notion that it was a golden age of perfection.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It hurts so much to have to close down the link. Yet, the madness it feeds us, would destoy all of us and I am not ready to let go yet. There is still too much to see and do.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* later */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sharyl did it. I'm not sure why I agreed, but it seemed like a great prank at the time. I am pregnant with a daughter created from Sharyl and my DNA. She grows inside me, and yet there have been visions. Oh goddess, such visions. My poor daughter, what have I done to you? Your life, I weep for your life. And yet, I cannot bring myself to end you, even to save you from it. Sharyl doesn't understand why I weep at night, yet she holds me and comforts me. And for my part, I can't bring myself to tell her what is coming. Not yet. Let her be happy for you a while longer, so I tell her it is in pain for the loss of Elentaryn.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I am staring at you now, growing inside me. Can you feel my hands holding you as I hold myself? It would be so easy to let you go, just a minor adjustment in my chemistry, yet, through all the pain, I see happiness for you. Not the way your mom and I would have wished it, yet happiness none the less.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Curse my weakness, I still can't tell him that my daughter isn't his. She grows daily and he has finally noticed, and he thinks she is his. It could have been, we have had relations. Relations, it's not even sex between us anymore. It was the dreaded mercy fuck on my part. I can only say he looked so forlorn that day as a part of him realized his dreams were falling apart around him. When we finished, the awareness passed and his delusions rose up in full glory once again. I think he must have known in some way though. He hasn't approached me again. I could ask Tyana, she monitors all the Labyrinth, but that would be the same wrong as he is doing.</p>
