<p class="sectioncaption">75 Krena, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We emerged from the anomaly right into a Razak patrol.  We were able to fight them off but we have taken some damage.  The Tarkran was so badly damaged she had to return to Karanal.  The shielding test results were perfect so we are going to try for Zeltrop on our own.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shortly after entering hyperspace one of our power systems failed, hopefully the power surges did not affect the nav computer.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">9 Marahasal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Ozimandys has emerged from hyperspace inside a series of caverns and rooms in a planet or moon.  Apparently nav systems were damaged by the power failure.  Doriendal managed to drag me out before dying.  After I regained consciousness I found myself in a rock cavern with a dust floor.  There were two singed wooden doors out of the room, I then went back into the wreckage and found Kaya and Sharyl Mediciamos still alive in the ward room.  They were badly injured but I managed to patch them up enough to keep them alive.  Sharyl has some very serious burns and Kaya has suffered a broken leg and several cracked ribs along with some burns.  I then went out to check the areas outside the ship.  After looking through several rooms I realized I was probably somewhere in the Labyrinth below the Gardens of Lazaar, further explorations led me to conclude that I was on level 3.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Using a space suit from a partially surviving airlock and materials from the computer area I managed to get medical supplies from the medical center.  On the way up I encountered the others we had left for the second voyage and let them know what had happened, 100 out of the original group still survived.  The others apparently had been in areas where parts of the Ozimandys appeared.  They had not received word of our transmission to the moon bases concerning our findings at the meeting point.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While several of us worked on Kaya and Sharyl, the rest of the group took several of the small thermal drills and cut tunnels hoping to find other pockets of the ship intact.  We found parts of the crew quarters and engineering but only 3 more survivors.  Fortunately they were not as seriously injured as Kaya or Sharyl.  The other survivors are a fighter pilot named Marek, a starship power engineer named Marasandra and a biochemist named Cassimeera.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Marahasal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first priority is to come up with a food source for the 105 of us.  By using the space suits we are able to work on the surface for short periods of time.  We are planning to install airlocks on some of the tube trains so we can use the system to travel around.  Surface explorations confirm that the gas only killed our people and not any of the animal or plant life.  A quick check shows the cave cat colony has not been damaged either.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next priority will be to contact and then rescue the other groups waiting at the moon bases for our return.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Perhaps a suitable living and working area can be built in one of the large caverns on level 5.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have sent a short burst transmission to Karanal as a test of communications but have heard nothing back.  It would seem we were correct about the energy anomaly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Since we are stuck here, we will have to plan on surviving this as best we can.  We will construct the necessary amount of Suspension chambers and put ourselves in.  Then we will set the systems to bring a few of us out every few zyrodyls to check on conditions.  Before we Suspend ourselves we will have to create a sustaining closed environment here in the labyrinth so we will have air and food when we come out to do our checks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So far none of our attempts to contact the moon bases have succeeded.  In the next couple of xers we will have to find a working shuttle and go check on them.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">12 Marahasal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Investigations of the larger caverns on level 5 show we should have enough room to establish our colony.  Several of the people we left were farmers and biologists who should be able to figure out how we can set up a working garden type environment.  Hopefully this will have enough plants to clean and renew our air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tomorrow we will begin rigging lighting in the largest of caverns on level five, then we will import as many plants and animals as we hope to be able to support.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marek and I found a ship at the space systems test facility and will be leaving in it for the red moon base tomorrow.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">15 Marahasal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marek and I have arrived at the red moon base.  We have found tragedy, it seems someone destroyed the life support systems and then blew open the main living areas.  There were no survivors.  Some of the dead had been in sealed subsections but without the life support systems they soon died also.  We have been unable to find out who was responsible for this tragedy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We are continuing on to the blue moon base.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">17 Marahasal, 1700 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have found basically the same situation on the blue moon base.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">81 Sarahabra, 1701 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Not much opportunity to enter in this journal.  Most of our time has been taken up working on the farming area.  Most of the large scale work on level 5 has been completed.  We have moved in animals and plants, from the surface, after suitable decontamination.  Water is available from an underground river that runs through the labyrinth network.  Fortunately the grey gas does not appear to be water soluble since there are no traces in the river water.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">56 Krena, 1701 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="comp_1">(First Computer/Suspension Problem Reference)</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have begun checking the Suspension systems and constructing the necessary number on level 5 so we can go into Suspension.  We have found several computer system problems and memory system errors.  All memory systems in the Suspension controllers, the brain to thought crystal reader we will use to Suspend ourselves, and in the main computer will be replaced with thought crystal units.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">29 Dorienal, 1702 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We are now entering Suspension.  The first check team will be awakened in 23 zyrodyls to check on current conditions.  If they need any help they will awaken more of us.  Assignment to these teams will be rotated through most of us.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 1725 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have decided to awaken with every check team.  This way I know what is going on and can help maintain continuity between groups.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everything is going fine.  The biomass in the large caverns of level 5 are performing better than hoped.  There were plenty of food animals and the air is very good.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 1750 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have checked on several of the long and medium range scanning systems.  They seem to still be functioning so I am having the computer monitor them and log anything they pick up.  This way each time we come out we can see if we have or have had any visitors. Currently they show no sign of visitors.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Krena, 1774 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were awakened for a power system malfunction.  It turned out to be a defective regulator on one of the generators.  We will consider this to be the 1775 awakening and run our checks now.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 1800 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everything is still progressing nicely.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 1825 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">No changes worth noting.  At this rate we are in for a peaceful wait.  At least that is what we all hope will happen.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 1850 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have decided to change these awakenings to every 50 zyrodyls, at least until we get closer to the half life of the grey gas.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 1900 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nothing out of the ordinary to report.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">1 Krena, 1950 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaya and I have awakened to do some routine checks.  Something tells us we should make every effort to check on the Tharth Suspension systems this time.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">12 Krena, 1950 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="comp_2">(Tharth System Malfunctions)</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kayara and I flew over to Tharth to check on operations over there.  We found their computer had malfunctioned, ours probably would have also had we not been here to maintain it.  Fortunately the Suspension controllers continued to function independently and only one percent of their units completely failed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Analysis revealed most of the failures were in the memory systems.  We are very glad we replaced all the controller memory modules before we entered Suspension or some of the units on our world might have failed also.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We will awaken our group and begin moving the Tharthian Thermionic Suspension units to our world so they will be easier to monitor.  They will be placed on the other side of the mountains from what had been Port Freedom.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">32 Sarahabra, 1951 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All the Tharth units have been moved and hooked up to our systems.  Since their system failure points out the fragility of our system we have tied the two main computers together and are now running them in parallel.  Communications will be in short burst, encoded packet transmission formats with the codes randomized.  We have replaced all the memory systems in the Tharth computer with thought crystal also.  We have also done several processor and controller modifications, replacing some of the oldest processors with the new optical units.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaya has re-written sections of the Tharth operating system to maximize the system for the communications linking and distributed multiprocessing.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 2000 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="tyana_1"></a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">There have been reports of strange anomalies in the computer.  It seems to anticipate requests on common and often repeated tasks.  Several people have commented on this.  I know of nothing that was done to the system during the last awakening that would account for these effects.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 2050 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="tyana_2"></a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">The computer anomalies are more noticeable.  Most of the tests we run are giving us results in about half the usual time.  A complete system diagnosis has not revealed anything that would account for this.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 2100 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="tyana_3"></a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">The mystery of the computer has been solved.  The computer has become self-aware. "She" has introduced herself to me as "Tatyana Zerena Marilayn Cheryenkov Petrovka, Tyana to my friends." She says she has been awake for a while now but has been incredibly bored while we have been sleeping.  She understands that we need to go back into Suspension but does not like the fact.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several theories have been put forth to explain this personality but so far the most plausible is based on the fact that thought crystal is semi-living.  It is thought that by having such large amounts of crystal with information in it tied together that somehow it became aware. No one can explain how a personality formed, but then we don't know how ours form either.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We will probably stay awake for a zyrodyl or two this time.  We want to do some research on current plant and animal forms to check on any mutation effects from the grey gas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We are planning several tube train journeys to collect as much information as we can on current planet wide conditions, along with plant samples for Cassimeera to study.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">12 Krena, 2100 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We are back from the first journey with over two hundred plant samples and several animals that show apparent mutations compared to previous generations.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">24 Krena, 2100 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cassi (Cassimeera) has found many subtle cell mutations in the plants and animals we recovered, especially when compared with our stocks in our "garden".</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">70 Krena, 2100 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Further research shows a strong link between the grey gas and the mutations.  More study will be necessary to determine what effect this will have on us should we eat the altered material.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">20 Haralei, 2100 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="life_1"></a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">One of the plants showing the highest level of change is the Ankham flower, a delicacy used for flavoring many dishes and as a garnish for many others.  It has a subtle flavor reminiscent of a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, with a hint of something unidentifiable.  Cassi has subjected a culture of our cells to the mutated material in that flower to determine if the mutations have introduced any toxicity.  The cells are thriving! Next she plans to feed several of our "garden" rabbits on the flowers and see what happens.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Other plants show similar results, so far none of them seem to be toxic.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Similar experiments with tissue samples show no toxicity in the meat either.  So far none of these results are more than preliminary good news though.  We still have several hundred zyrodyls for the mutations to progress.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To insure no mixing of experimental animals with the group on level 5 we have released any experimental animals outside the labyrinth.  Most of them have been equipped with small telemetry units, surgically implanted and powered with biochemical power cells.  One of Tyana's projects while we sleep is to track these tagged animals</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 2150 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="life_2"></a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tyana reports that several of the rabbits we used in our experiments 50 zyrodyls ago are still alive and well.  We have recovered these animals and checked them thoroughly.  We find that cell deterioration has been halted in these rabbits.  The cell replacement rate exactly matches the cell death rate.  Even nerve tissue seems to be replaced as it dies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Looking through the records we found these animals had been fed Ankham flowers as part of their diets. The results can't be entirely due to the flowers though, otherwise any creature that ate those flowers would also show minimal aging. Unfortunately the rest of the rabbit diet is fairly generic but did not produce similar effects in any of the other animals.  From telemetry records Tyana believes the heal rate on these rabbits is better than that of their fellows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cassi wants to continue with additional experiments to determine the exact cause of this. At this point the rest of us feel it can wait a while longer.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">84 Tamer, 2150 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="life_3"></a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">We placed small cuts on four rabbits, two of the Ankham flower rabbits, and two normal rabbits.  The heal rate of the Ankham rabbits is much better than that of the normal rabbits.  In this small sample one rabbit healed 3 times faster and the other healed 2 times faster.  None of us feels like continuing the experiment with more rabbits or more severe injuries at this point.  We will add to the telemetry of the Ankham rabbits and implant the same type of units in the other rabbits.  The upgrades will allow better monitoring of blood chemical and cell activity, with proper analysis this may give us a better indication of injuries and heal abilities in these rabbits.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 2200 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tyana is complaining about being very bored while we are asleep.  I have asked her to run in depth checks on all the Suspension units planet wide and compile a list of problem areas for us to check next time we are awake.  This will not take her all that long but it will be something to do besides watching the scanners for visitors and monitoring rabbits.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">56 Haralei, 2201 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="comp_3">(Suspension System Malfunctions)</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tyana has woken us up to report many problems with the Suspension chambers.  She has found many of them have incorrect or missing revival sequences, others have missing revival chemicals, and others have missing personality memory cubes.  We will begin an immediate check of all units.

<p class="sectioncaption">81 Haralei, 2201 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="comp_4">(Diagnostics)</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have dismantled and reassembled all of the 1500 Suspension chambers at the Agricultural Research Station (the closest Suspension site).  We found 200 units, containing top scientists and other leaders in their fields, had no thought crystal cubes and 400 others had various mechanical defects guaranteed to kill the emerging person.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Based on these results we will do the same thing to every other Suspension unit we have.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">67 Garateal, 2202 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="comp_5">(Checking All)</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have finished checking all the Suspension units, both ours and the ones from Tharth.  We found 10% had blood reservoirs contaminated with formaldehyde, another 20% had missing or reversed vials of Time Derivative and Natryamine, another 5% had missing memory cubes, and another 15% had memory cubes that had been contaminated in some manner, most likely touched by someone during processing. Some units had multiple problems. The final tally for damage was 35% of the units had at least one problem.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have repaired what damage we could, including re-programming any control systems that had scrambled code.  I am not yet sure what we are going to be able to do about the missing or damaged memory cubes.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 2250 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everything is still going well.  Nothing to report this time.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 2300 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still nothing new to report.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 2350 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">No important changes yet.  We will awaken next in 2398 and begin another investigation of plants and animals to check on further mutations.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">76 Tamer, 2398 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now maybe we can stave off some of Tyana's boredom.  We have all awakened and will be forming several survey teams to gather information and samples to check on current conditions.  We will also begin constant monitoring of the levels of grey gas remaining.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">46 Krena, 2399 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="people_1">(Damaged People First Reference)</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">All plant and animal investigations have been very encouraging, none of the mutations we have found indicate any toxic changes in what we would normally consume!  All species of plants and animals seem to be thriving.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We still do not know what to do with the damaged people in Suspension.  So far the plan is to wake up a small group of apparently non-damaged people and check them for more subtle problems.  If they check out then we will begin reviving larger groups of them.  When all of the non-damaged ones are out and about then maybe we can come up with something to help the others.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At this time we plan to start revival about a zyrodyl after we find no more traces of gas.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">48 Tamer, 2400 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="people_2">(Damaged People - Revival Plan 1)</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">All our sensor arrays show no more sign of the grey gas.  In one zyrodyl we will begin reviving our Suspended people.  Excitement is high as we are starting to get tired of just our small group to interact with.</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">49 Krena, 2401 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have decided to revive the Suspended people section by section.  We will all be on hand at each site and will begin with the units near the old agricultural research station.  Only those units showing no damage will be opened.  All severely damaged people will be taken to the labyrinth and stored there in the units we have vacated.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">50 Krena, 2401 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="people_3">(Damaged People - Agro Research Group)</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">This xer we ended Suspension near the agro research station.  Many of those revived showed severe disorientation and lethargy, hopefully this is just the effects of long Suspension.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the xer progressed the lethargy seemed to wear off, the disorientation has remained.  Many of the people are still just sitting around dazed.  They did eat when we put food in front of them.  We are hoping these effects will pass after natural sleep.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">51 Krena, 2401 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">No change in the condition of the revivees.  They will eat only if food is set in front of them.  Most just sit as if waiting for something.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have observed a curious reaction in several of them, I told Sharyl to go get me a piece of equipment but did not say her name.  When I finished the instruction the entire group of revivees got up and headed off after the piece of equipment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaya tried asking them what they were waiting for and they told her they were waiting for the masters to give them instructions.  Apparently we are considered to be the masters they are referring to.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We have Tyana and Sharyl examining and testing the memory cubes and suspension chambers for any clue as to what has gone wrong.  No further units will be opened at this time.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">55 Krena, 2401 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="people_4">(Damaged People - Status)</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="gate_6">(World Gates - L7 Gate)</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">The condition of the revivees has not changed.  They will find food for themselves, even going and gathering plants if need be but they show very little inclination to do much else.  Their survival instincts seem to be working very well, though.  None of them has eaten or gathered anything harmful.  The gathering tasks seem to be shared in some way, with certain groups always going after the same things.  We have decided to pick up several people and brainscan them to see if we can find the cause of this.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As we were taking the drugged revivees down to the brainscan unit we noticed several humanoids wandering around level 7 of the labyrinth.  Some of them attacked when they saw us, luckily we were able to dodge and run, but several other groups stopped to talk.  Those that talk (and speak anything we can remotely understand) have no idea about how they have gotten here, only that they were somewhere familiar and then suddenly here.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We back-tracked to where they came from and found spherical energy distortion at the end of a far passageway.  As we approached the chamber gravity and space seemed to alter.  We have taken measurements with some of our instruments and the results seem vaguely familiar.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">56 Krena, 2401 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="gate_7">(World Gates - Reports)</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">The brainscans of the damaged people are very disturbing.  There appears to be no actual damage to the brain, the personality, or even to the sequence of memories yet something is wrong.  Sharyl is going to attach monitoring equipment to several of the more aware people and return them to the others.  Maybe this will give us some clues about what is happening.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So far Tyana and Sharyl have found no damage to the Suspension systems or the memory cubes from the agro site chambers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have remembered where I saw the energy anomaly results before.  This is the same type of energy field as was accidentally produced while trying to strengthen hull metal.  Later this xer I will go to that site and see if I can find more information.  The reports Tyana has are very vague. (reports listed below:)</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">58 Krena, 2401 ALW</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When I arrived at the old test site I found a stone temple built over the access tunnel and a large village with several different species of beings wandering around.  Some were humanoid, others had human torsos and horse bodies, still others were short and squat with long bushy beards, etc.  While I watched a small group of bipedal lizards was led out of the temple by a yellow robed woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Flying a spiral out from the site I noticed many indications of camps scattered around the valley and surrounding hills.  As far as I could tell a large number of beings were immigrating through the Well.  Since there are at least two of these things I think we need to do a planetary survey very soon to check the numbers and movements of these immigrants and to see if there are any more of these "gates".</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">60 Krena, 2401 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sharyl has a preliminary report on her monitoring.  The complete text can be found in the GENMED data files under TS-AE 10001.10.  Basically all the monitoring equipment showed minimal brain activity in all subjects.  Even the most aware subjects were operating at barely above instinct level.  They would look for food when they were hungry and sleep when tired.  Cooperation seemed to be total, but there was no evidence of any conscious control over it.  No one was giving instructions yet they all function like hive creatures...That may be the clue!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have told Sharyl to run full diagnostic checks on the components we removed from the transfer unit we used in the labyrinth, maybe there was some type of sabotage to the transfer device itself.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">68 Krena, 2401 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tyana has found small changes in several sections of the transfer control programs, these changes enhance any mental activity that causes instinctual and cooperative behavior.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sharyl, on a wild guess, managed to find and analyze a sample of suspension fluid from one of the units.  It contained traces of some type of contaminant, unfortunately the sample was too small to figure out exactly what type.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">70 Krena, 2401 ALW</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sharyl has taken blood and tissue samples from her monitored subjects and done complete system chemistry examinations on them.  Cross-checking with pre-evac medical records shows many subtle differences in those subjects with previous chemistry work-ups.  These results concerned her so much that she subjected all of us to similar testing to see if any of us showed the same symptoms.  None of us did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So far all environmental checks show nothing that could account for these changes.  Sharyl will do tests on their genetic structures next.  In the mean time she will try using drugs to bring the test subjects chemical balances back to their normal ranges, at least on the ones she has previous histories on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The drug treatments have helped slightly, the subjects have shown a bit more initiative and leadership.  They are referred to as the masters when we are not around.  Brain activity is still very low, however.  Sharyl has tried several variations in dosages but the levels always seem to settle very near her original test results.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The genetic tests show small variations in the genetic material of the one person who had a previous genetic typing to compare the results to.  With only one test subject the results are inconclusive to say the least.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sharyl wants to work on a project begun shortly before the disaster.  Work had been started on a computer simulation package capable of simulating the actions and effects of genetic codes.  We were hoping to eventually be able to give the system a sample of genetic material and have it generate a simulation of the organism it would produce, including hormone and chemical reactions.  Some of the more optimistic researchers were hoping to get at least the most probable brain cell linkage pattern developed also.  The project looked promising but R and D time was figured to be at least 200 zyrodyls since we haven't even perfected our understanding of the genetic codes yet.  She does not expect to get results any where near the goals but does hope to find out enough about the genetic codes to get a clue to the changes the alterations might have caused.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have told her not to be too worried yet since we have only awakened one small group of Suspended people and have only one definite case of genetic alteration.  We are now planning to awaken one or two people in each area as spot checks.  We are going to cross-reference the Suspension lists with medical files to try and awaken those people we have the most medical data on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Results of our awakenings have been consistently bad.  In every case the small chemical and genetic differences are present.  All subjects show the same behavioral traits as our original group.  Drug treatments have produced results identical to our original experiments.  We have taken twenty of these new subjects and added them to our original group.  This will give us more subjects that we have good medical histories on.  We have returned the others to Suspension.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In every Suspension unit we opened we collected samples of the Suspension fluid.  Sharyl managed to identify the contaminant as some type of bacteria.  So far we don't know what it does since all samples contained only dead bacteria.  We have found the dead bacteria produce no effect in any of our lab animals.  So far we have not tried it on any of us.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At my request Sharyl tried to enhance brain activity using the brainscan to stimulate curiosity.  The benefits were impressive at the start but quickly faded to a level just slightly above the beginning point, if nothing else produces better results we will use this approach with many reinforcements over a period of time and see if a more permanent benefit can be achieved.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have just found out Sharyl tried the bacteria on herself.  After thoroughly chewing her over she gave me the results.  Thankfully there was no apparent effect on her in any way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The planetary survey is finally complete.  The results are far more disturbing than we hoped.  We have found six major areas showing signs of immigration.  Investigation and instrument probing verify the existence of seven energy bubble "gates", hereafter referred to as gates.  Most of our major land masses are slowly being taken over.  We have all discussed the options and have not yet decided what to do.  At the current rate the immigrants will control most of the major land masses in under 20 zyrodyls.  We have no idea if we can find any working solution to the revivees plight in that time.  If we can't I'm not sure what we can do to hold the land.  If nothing else works within the next 10 zyrodyls we will try continued enhancements with the brainscan unit and see if we can get at least a somewhat functioning group going.</p>
