<p class="regtxt5">This is the first instance of a <a href="../gates_inx.htm">World Gate</a> to appear on Zeltrop. It was formed through a spacial tear created during an experiment to create materials even harder than Hull Metal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During the evacuation, the facility was stripped of technical data and every bit of moveable equipment. The central chamber, gantries, and heavy equipment remained and were sealed behind the security doors. These doors require a functioning <a href="../items/ring_key.htm">ring key</a> to open.</p>
