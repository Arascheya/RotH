<p class="regtxt5">Outer Systems resource development company. This is one of the two opportunistic development companies that handle most Outer Systems resource gathering. Rival of DevelStar Resource Developers Group.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">OutSystems is one of the resource provider consortium companies. It will aquire planets, rape them of all valuable resources, planet form them using government funding and specifications, and release them as colony worlds. Officially they are not supposed to interfere with indigent populations if it turns out there are any. Unofficially, as long as no one complains, xenocide is ignored. They use a procedure known as Resource Maximization Protocol, often called Rape, Murder, Pillage by any indigents. This methodology is rapid exploitation with minimal cost per unit of resource returned.</p>
