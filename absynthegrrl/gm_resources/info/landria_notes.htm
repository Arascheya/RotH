<p class="regtxt5">Parchment found in helm that L'andria was looking for:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">No unenthralled adventurers shall pass to the 7th Gate until they walk between The One born as two.  Then shall be the beginning of the end of the reign of the Chosen of Azeloth.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">What Aria knows of the Orange Crystal that should have been in the helm:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Sounds like a gem of red draogn control, lost in the original Dark Forces uprising.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">What L'andria knows about Azeloth:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Name out of legend said to be a great priest or arcane of some demon god or goddess , who constructed various evil artifacts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Information from the Isle of Research, Arcane Guild:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">AZELOTH:   In OLD legends he was the High Priest of Etesa, the Mistress of the Many Hells, and Queen of all Evil.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">ENPHMET: A major demon cult of the Dark Forses.  His priesthood have a ritual for taking an enemy's head and then being able to use the victim's magic, POW, and INT, similar to a bound or allied spirit or a familiar. He is known as Prince of the Dead, followers will have a raggedly severed head tatoo some where on thier body.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">ISHRA: Demoness of spiders, she also guards the entrance web into the regions of hell.  It is rumored that she conducts the Dark Arcanes to their testing site somewhere in the regions of hell.  She is worshipped by many Drow. For the past 30 years (since the Hellgate Wars), her power seems to be declining.  There are fewer priests and their magic is less potent.  Her temples and artifacts are not as powerful or as well protected as before.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">DARK FORSES UPRISINGS:  The Hellgate Wars about 30 years ago.  Another worldwide uprising about 500-550 years ago.  About 2000 years ago an uprising of reptilians led by an arcane of great power destroyed the civilization of Nagrathea in the northeastern region of the Great Wastes.  This uprising was quelled by Tesh-Mar, a mage of great power and reknown.  The leader of the reptilian forses disappeared and was presumed dead.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">MARGLA:  Not much is known about her.  She or at least the Hut has been around quite awhile.  The Hut is mentioned in Tesh-Mar's writings. Margla has a caldron or beast that she rides when out of the Hut.  it is controlled wy whistling of some form. Margla is truly chaotic, some say you can treat with her others flatly denign it.</p>
