<p class="pagecaption">Kayara Hologram</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hologram from 2" Black Jade ball</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When ball is touched a hologram of a white robed, blonde haired female appears.  Saying "To whom it may concern.  I am leaving information, vital to the defeat of the Dark Times, within this device.  Please see that it is delivered to those actively opposing the Dark Times.  Watch the following images carefully for they contain crucial information."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her image is replaced with the image of 10' diameter hut on chicken legs.  Standing in front of this hut is a hideous, old woman, holding a book bound in Gold Dragon hide.  She closes the book, turns and enters the hut.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The image changes to show the hut, the woman and a figure dressed in red wearing a Red Dragon Mask.  The woman and the figure seem to be conversing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The figure dressed in red nods to the woman and gestures and 100 lizard like creatures start filing into the hut.  The woman enters the hut last, and the hut disappears.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The white robed woman reappears and says "It is of utmost importance that the book held within this hut be recovered, undamaged.  For it contains the weaknesses of the Dark Times leaders.  I wish you well on your endeavors.  May the gods watch over you and bless you."  The image fades out.</p>
