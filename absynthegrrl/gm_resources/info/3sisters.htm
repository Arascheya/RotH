<p class="pagecaption">The Three Sisters</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Three Sisters is what the <a href="../gods/younger_gods.htm">Greater Powers</a> are known as among their worshippers. There are various other cults that worship only one of them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This cult has existed in many forms throughout the history of the multi-verse. Every sentient race has a variant of this cult during their history. While it may not be prominent, it never fades completely away either. Something about the Three Sisters resonates in the depths of every being.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Three Sisters are: Sha'Nyakla (Zyrtisklya) Order, (Enlyolshe) Balance, and (Klayashne) Chaos. (Sha' - Great, Nyakla - Sister) These names are in the eldest tongue, however, even these names aren't binding since the Sisters have no names between them. Over time these names have mutated into countless variations as they have been used, forgotten, and discovered again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Three Sisters are the oldest of The Sisters, who are several near gods. <a href="../npcs/ishra.htm">Ishra</a> is an example of one of the other Sisters.</p>
