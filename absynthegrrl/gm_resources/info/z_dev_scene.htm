    pair needed to gain access to the Hand’s holdings and to seal the final hell gate

obsidian citadel ruins - destroyed by a group of adventurers, used to be over a tube train access point. One of the remaining nazgul has taken up residence there as a beach-head for dark forces re-build. Hand is still trying to close remaining gate in labyrinth so he can close his and then re-open the entire network.

sphynx transport near Kur Istan

dragon lance - use if ever set up game as a source of storm troops for Hand, mainly transported by Hut

Biomedical Disease Isolation and Research Station - party of adventurers disappears in Altarkran after mentioning this site, they came into town asking about a flat black metal structure in the jungles.
This location contains records of grey gas and experiments around trying to neutralize it. Contains iso labs; chem labs; small hospital with OR, intensive care, emergency facilities; isolation entrance; admin; morgue; incinerator; small cryo facility; and other facilities for dealing with biological emergencies. This area’s answer to CDC.

Design a poison that has no effect until a heal 6 is cast on the person

Mushrooms – brown hair moss – sneeze uncontrollably for 1D6 minutes, no other effect
                      Toad tables – harmless and tasty
                      Eurmal’s crumbs – roll 1D10
        1-2 = -1D10 hit points – must be healed by majik
        3-6 = -1D8 hit points – must be healed by majik
        7 = no effect
        8 = +1 point of power
        9 = +2 points of power
    10 = +3 points of power

Seekers for the Ancestors - group devoted to finding artifacts of the ancients and using them for their own purposes. Their adventurers are called ‘investigators’ and are equiped with various techno style weapons

Hut can bounce to: LV426, just before atmospheric processor explosion, maybe see drop ship leaving. Will see explosion then will see the hut sitting on a column of rock with the surroundings scoured away. Door will warn of extremely dangerous environment outside if they try to open it.

Appear in the docking bay of 2001 ship, or a gamma world scenario, crew lounge of old battle ship stationed near razak home world,

Hand is now trying to close last open hell gates so he can reform the entire hell gate location grouping.

Tube train speeds – from fairbanks time – continental – 1000 zeems per hour
Ocean transit tunnels – 2000 zeems per hour
Tunnel structure formed with magnetic material in bottom to form repulsion field for eggs. Cars actually provide the field generation from on-board fusion packs. There are accelleration coils placed at various points along the tunnel system, often at junction points and places where air needs to be evacuated. These pumping/accelleration stations are placed every 300 to 500 zeems.

Sphynx cult – local to altarkran – worship of sphynx statue under the sphynx in tavern. The supplicants pray for revelations of knowledge and sacrifice snakes to it. Belief has it the sphynx statue hungers for a green serpent. There is a secret compartment that opens if the green jade cobra statue from the FE MU test site is placed within the statue’s mouth. The compartment holds a sapphire pendant which will open a gate from the sphynx on the university approach to the tube train station below. It also contains four hieroglyphics translations.

Innkeeper from the sphynx in gave up on the search for the city of knowledge after four members of a five member party died in the jungles during the search. He threw the guide stone into a river and returned home.

Cantina at castle fred – someone mentions they can guide the party to level 6 but beware of raiding parties from level 7. Sphynx trail can be picked up on level 6 or they can take party to a place on level 5 containing info on the path. (nitch room 15)

Retain shade’s fortress. If the stabilizing patterns are damaged, it will begin to drift between realities.

RavenLoft and Strahd ideas:
Fyodor Borusa – was a renegade time lord, fleeing galifrey with the rod of rastinon. He crashed at an out of the way manor in russia. The crash triggered a regeneration and left him looking like the eldest son. As part of the crash his tardis was damaged, forcing him to search for replacement parts.

He has travelled far to arrive at the home of lord weathermay. He has bought an old mansion overlooking the small town and has begun ordering equipment to try and create the parts needed for the tardis.
He has gotten word of a way to form gates to other places and has re-directed his efforts in thiat direction, hoping to open a gate to a place where he can get parts.

Strahd has become aware of his plans and wants to prevent them. In this case strahd is more of the good guy – he fears the opening of a gate to ravenloft and the release of the other truly nasty beings from there. He also fears the possible impact on the holding place of etesa and maybe the carnifex wizards. His motives are somewhat selfish – he doesn’t want any other players of power in the quiet realm he managed to land in.
The first movement of the hut by the current group opened a side lobe of the gate and sucked strahd and his castle into the transilvanian mountains, near the road that fyodor followed out of russia.

Lord weathermay likes fyodor, but doesn’t trust him.
His daughter finds fyodor exotic and charming.

Need to plant someone who detects strahd in their midst and raises an alarm against the vampire. Treat this similar to old friend of the family and such – in this case the vampire is the lesser of the evils.

Fyodor has just stumbled on a tome describing a way to open a gate that requires the sacrifice of a living being. To him this doesn’t seem to be an out-of-line price. He will randomly choose a lesser villager as his victim. He does not realize the procedure he has found is the one for creating low order hell gates.

Sand kraken – migrate through deserts of the great wastes absorbing minerals and such from the sand. They exude a greyish paste from the ridge of their heads, it functions as a kind of hardener/lubricant to protect their skin from the friction of the sand as they move. If it is collected and properly processed it will leave a blackish powder that can be alloyed with iron. This will increase the strength of the iron. Increases hit points of weapon by 5 points (RQ)

Spilled liquid will call sand kraken, charged (z version) power crystals will cause them to unfold but not attack. They can then be directed by empathy to transport groups of people. Large ones can carry up to 20 human sized beings.

It is refered to as desert spice and has a pungent curry-like smell.

Processing it can also yield one drop of heavenly essence per 100 pounds of material processed. For this to be effective all material must have been harvested directly from sand kraken, not taken from residues left behind after they have moved through. 10 ounces of Mobil Dis Salt is also required. This process will yield 12 pounds of hardener, 40 pounds of general purpose fertalizer, 3 pound desert spice, and 20 pounds of carbon.

Three pounds of additive will produce enough strengthened iron for either:
2 great swords
3 bastard swords
4 short swords
6 daggers


bowl of purity – needed to destroy the hand
orbs – needed to permanently eal hell gates
vessel of orbs – needed to permanently seal hell gate
ghost ship and shade – needed to gain access to the hand’s stronghold
shade – needs to be released from demonic bondage by moon stones (this will destroy the stones), then she will be willing to assist a party, but only if they promise to help her release her sister from the ship. Once they are released they will be approx 30 years old for calculating remaining lifespan.
Ghost ship – will help a party especially if they know the method of her release from the ship. Release – must sprinkle the stabilized ghost and ship with liquid in which the hand and eye of azeloth have been disolved. This requires the bowl of purity.
Well artifacts – hand wants them because they are an alternate way into the hells, aztol wants them to control the world gates and he hopes these items will give him that
Well artifacts – the backpack controller unit used in the second gate experiment at the first appearing gate bubble. Consists of a backpack power source and control system and an arm mounted control panel.

There are excavations occuring at the snakepipe hollow hellgate site. If a party member is one of the workers they will find on orange diamond with a red flame dancing in it’s center (blaster power crystal with 2 charges)
Leader of the excavations is an Alu demon from MM2-35 with a contingent of 35 human guards, 15 broos, and 95 slaves
This group will sometimes raid surrounding areas for more abe bodies. They do not pillage, just rape and capture.
The nearest village is called Stone Quary village. It was formed by a group of people who are not afraid of the old Dark Forces site. They are quarying the stone from the old fortress and selling it to the empire.

Can be used at shardra’s – the theft of the prototype gate controller (well artifacts) has just occurred. A weakened party is fleeing through the city. The adventurers can be hired to give chase. This will place them directly in aztol’s path.

Red moon malt brew will show the true form of a possessor if it drinks it. It only requires a small amount and the effect is very brief. Possessors will not drink eye of beholder bourbon – it will kill them instantly.

The  scarab of power resides deep within the mountains beneath the monastery of infinity, near the village of pilots roost.

The centipede of purpose resides in the path of the water entrance to the hall of death, beyond the veil, but before the school of sisterhood

intercept message capsule at an inn. In it is a note from the eldest of the seven to a minion directing them to look for aliens.
Text – “There is a creature I seek. This is all that is known of it: …a creature that gestates inside a living human host, these are your words, and has concentrated acid for blood… Find a specimen and your reward will be beyond your dreams. Eldest of the seven “  stories talk of their invasion of the legendary dwarven  Fist Home. The stories tell of First Home being abandoned when it was invaded by an un-killable reptilian menace.

Minstrel of the dawn knew both twins. He loved the one who became the shade. He fled the rath of emperor sarnar at the kidnapping of his daughter. Later he heard of the emperoro’s death by his own hand and returned to look for karyn. He could not find her. Locath crumbled with the death of the emperor as struggles between various power hungry groups destroyed the city. He searched but could find out nothing about his lover. He did stumble across the moon stones, but didn’t know what they were. He was killed by brigands for them.

Could consider treasure hunt in the archipelago, place freebooters at far end of chain. Mainland port is machine ruins. Machine ruins is at the end of the lotus empire extension. (subs for lunar empire of RQ fame). It contains a small garrison of troops, 2 smallish taverns, a temple to the lotus goddess, homes of fishermen and traders. There is a large caravan that comes in once in a while to trade with the archipelago islands. One tavern has a gate to shardra’s cavern of dark delights. There are sunken ships from the ancients time in the harbor. People used to dive for treasures in them, but they were cleaned out long ago.

Can use raus stuff from shardra’s.

Someone has a dream about the crystal skull needed to access gigabolt mountain core tap, person using it is dressed in brown with a hooded black cape with purple lining

CSWE worship of Armadad Bog replaced by worship of the Demon Spawner. Sacrificial victims are raped by the high priest while under the influence of a rune priest spell. This spell determines the type of demon spawned. The growing demon consumes the host, becoming one of the following types:
1) pirana – BB38; 2) byakhee – CC37 dwg DD44; 3) sahaguin/deep one – CC43, MM84 dwg DD45;
4) great race – CC47 dwg DD45; 5) migo – CC51 dwg DD46; 6) primordial one – DD46;
7) shogoth – CC57; 8) metal fiend – BB39

place following texts on karanal in ruins of tabr – beach song (dune 26); love song (dune 321)

computer on tharth runs in parallel with system on zeltrop
For use in stories – maybe – or could transfer hut directly from margla to ghost wind crew
Hut crew – from early seattle adventures
Landria, aria, natasha, raqqua, phylth, minstrel of the dawn (GL), ivan, vladimir, doneva and cheri – sisters, leo, katriana, arcane tutor (temporary resident)

Consider part of one of cf2 levels as deck of many things. Card images are inlaid into florr of chamber, effects occur on exit from either section or area.

Castle with the lower levels under water. Embedded in the walls are spells for water breathing. If a character just walks into the water it will automatically fire and allow them to breath normally. If another water breathing type spell is cast it will cancel both spells – leaving the person unable to breath under water – there will be no outward sign other than starting to drown when trying to breath in the water.

Trap – floor is of metal gridding, there are trigger plates that appear as majikak triggers. The actual trigger is the casting of a dispel majik – this triggers the trap and electrifies the gridding. This trap is harmless unless someone messes with it.

Trap – in an area that has been salted heavily with hallucinatory terrain, plant on hallucination that mirrors what is actually there.

Trap – on a chest or object protected by a symbol, place a symbol on a material component, then place another material component and symbol over it where the symbol looks broken – make it look like the trap has been sprung.

Trap – mirror of life trapping in bottom of chest, under clothes, etc.


For use in RuneSpace type scenarios:
Bugs in System – after party has a ship – dracon pharm. Hold/operate the gas mining
Dramune run – use to get party a ship, tie in talons
Ship – use modified second mortgage scenario from traveller stuff (if still have), after ship is aquired.
Sundown on Starmist –
Starting scenario? – bus routine from traveller digest 20 – hiawatha gambit – if bus – use lifeboat?
2001/2010 – either hyperdrive malfunction or hut jump
use engineer availabe from traveller scenarios – sub in Llewelyn Tigrero as designed for hut. She is an awesome engineer, but unorthodox…

communications – using matched crystal sets – thought crystal prototype from karanal project – allows instantaneous communication between sites. Since the crystal is grown under relatively controlled conditions it is possible to create networks of sites that are linked by units with similar crystals. Secure communication is achieved by placing coded recognition systems on the crystals at each location. The unit will only accept and translate signals that have it’s target id. These units use the highest order of coding available – at this time Galactic Security Directorate (GSD) 766B

data capsule containing a list of transfers into and out of the containment zone over the last 3 years

a group of pirates has been into the possessor zone and removing eggs. This group was responsible for the destruction of ghost wind’s crew. Either they were passengers and hijacked the ship, or they force boarded her when she got too close to what they were doing…

ambassador krenski – a very polite, friendly, helpful person – later replaced by possessor.
