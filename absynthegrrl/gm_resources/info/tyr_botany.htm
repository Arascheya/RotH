<p class="regtxt5">Producers of the Tyranthilus Void Plant line of expensive ship-board plants. These plants are favored among the very rich for space yacht decorations. They can survive null-gravity situations and require only nutrient solution and water. Both are absorbed through their leaves. These plants are climbers and creepers, using their attachments to anchor themselves to various items. The come in many exotic leave and flower patterns.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They also produce a line of commercial air scrubbers based on bio-mass. These are low maintenance systems that require nutrient solution and periodic trimming. These are cost competitive with chemical/mechanical scrubber systems and have found wide market penetration.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara is friends with the owners of this company and provided shipping services for them when they were just starting out. She still provides assistance for small shipping needs, mostly in the Fringe Worlds. As a result she has gotten many of the more expensive Void Plant line for Ghost Wind at cost or as "beta test" models.</p>
