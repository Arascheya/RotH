<p class="pagecaption">Prague Cabal</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is an underground organization of several powerful vampyr. Their main objective is to maintain a balance of power in the European countries that is beneficial to their long term goals. These goals being safety, security, and the advancement of their own monetary gains. To this end they will reveal vampyr that are a danger to the <a href="hunters.htm">Hunters</a> for removal.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Cabal is not above political assassination and manipulation to maintian the desired balance. This is done through agents and proxies so they cannot be traced.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Currently the Cabal is composed of Matthias Corvinus, Vlad Dracul, Princess Libuse of Prague, Charles IV of Prague, add others as desired.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The cabal also searches for information on the <a href="../npcs/iskandera.htm">Origin</a>, the first vampyr. Many myths have grown up over the years about this being. It is no longer possible to sort any of the facts from the surrounding fictions. They believe they would know if the Origin had been destroyed. What they are actually feeling is the connection between the vampyrites and the controller.</p>
