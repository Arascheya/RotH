<p class="pagecaption">The Dark Carnival</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is an adaptation of the <a href="raven_carnival.htm">Ravenloft Carnival</a>. Some data is close - that of most of the Performers and "Skurra", however there are significant differences as well. <a href="gate_dim.htm">The Twisting</a> is a side effect of the <a href="../gates_inx.htm">World Gate</a> interlinking and exposure to the <a href="gate_dim.htm">Gate Dimension</a>. The more times the organism is exposed, the more likely there will be mutation and alteration, even with the protective fields of the gate controller <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> uses.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Carnival travels through a semi-breathable dimension as it goes from place to place. The view out of a vardo window is similar to the Babylon 5 hyperspace, only in shades of deep green. The caravan is protected by the same basic field structure as a starship, except gas permeable, to allow the air to replenish that inside the containments. The first time a Mayfly sees the Void, a sanity check is required.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The vardos are drawn by void beasts, which are similar to hell horses, but feel no fear moving through the void. They have glowing green eyes and their tails and manes are always moving as if in a strong wind, even in still air. <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> creates a Gate for the vardos to enter, and then they follow a path only she can detect to the next location where they are needed. There, she opens another Gate and the Carnival emerges into the next Realm. Between the direction sense of the void beasts and the linking beacons built into the vardos, no vardos have been lost to the void.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In extreme cases <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> can use the <a href="../gates_inx.htm">World Gates</a> in a defensive way by literally throwing a being into the Void. If she is feeling charitable, it will be a void with no air, resulting in death. If she is not feeling charitable it will be a place in the void far from any natural openings, forcing the being to wander the gate void until it can find an escape portal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Dark Carnival wanders the multi-verse through a <a href="../gates_inx.htm">World Gate</a> link. It appears where ever there is a nexus being or event. After <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> and <a href="../npcs/irena_k.htm">Irena</a> forge their alliance, the Carnival is a mechanism of the Balance Keeper.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Carnival folk call themselves the <a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">T'Sani</a>, the Wanderers. They believe they are the favored in life. They are able to go where they want, do as they will, and laugh at the constrictions the Static, the bound, the "normal" folk, live with all their lives. The greatest insult to a <a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">T'Sani</a> is to be called Static.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Silent are beings who perform all the basic tasks of the Carnival except for Speaking parts. They are the rousties, the cooks, cleaners, maintainers, and random entertainments of the Carnival. They speak only in a "battle language" of music, movement, and sign. Few of the Speaking, the actual main acts, understand the Silent Speech. <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a>, the Carnival Mistress does. The Silent have chosen to become Silent, so they may never speak of the things they have seen. When a Mayfly is accepted into the Carnival they may choose to become a Silent or a Speaker, or they will be assigned a place by <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a>. <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> will use spells to render the Silent truly Silent. The Silent wear elaborate white face makeup, the Masque, with incredible designs or figures created in it. No two Silent will ever have the exact same masque, with the occasional exception of identical twins. It is a grave insult and personal affront to see a Silent without their masque.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> creates the masque paints from a secret formula. It resonates with the psych of the wearer and forms the patterns based on what it detects. One of the ingredients for the masque paint is powdered thought resonant crystal. The masque must be scrubbed off and re-applied at the dark of the red moon, or a cycle that would correspond to it. <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> has a clock in her vardo that tracks this time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The majority of the Silent are women. The Dark Carnival is seen as a way of escape to many women in the <a href="multiverse.htm">multi-verse</a> who long for freedom and safety from oppressive relationships and societies. There are some male Silent, but they are far rarer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Speakers are the "main acts" of the Dark Carnival. They are the ones that require speech for their performances and activities. While it is considered an honor to be a Speaker, there is the great responsibility to never speak of the secrets of the Carnival or the Realms that have been seen. A Silent may petition to become a Speaker by performing a self created act thought to be of "main attraction" quality. <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> is the final arbiter of whether or not the Silent auditioning will be moved to the ranks of the Speaking. A Speaker may retire to the ranks of the Silent by applying to <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> as well. Once the transition occurs, the Speaker is rendered Silent and issued a jar of masque.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Mayflies are the new-comers to the Carnival. They are the strays and mongrels that hang onto the Carnival. Mayflies may eventually be absorbed fully into the Carnival, or they may spin off in other Realms. This is as much their decision as <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a>'s. All Mayflies must pass a screening by <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a>, otherwise they are turned away on their realm of origin before the Carnival moves on. Prospective Mayflies must also submit to the Prelaten, pledging themselves to the good of the Carnival. Failure to accept the Prelaten results in immediate expulsion from the Carnival grounds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Potential mayflies are given an amethyst <a href="../items/mayfly_pass.htm">"Mayfly Pass"</a> which will allow them to call or find the Carnival if they later decide they want to join. It is taken from them once they submit to the Prelaten.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Carnival Grounds are the area inside the outermost circle of vardos. It is considered "neutral space", outside the controls of the realm it is in. No external form of control may be exerted within the Carnival Grounds. Anything requiring action will be handled by the Carnival itself. Any Static appealing to a non-Carnival source for justice or redress will be sadly disappointed. Their only option for resolution is to appeal to the Carnival Ky'ris. Any Speaker can direct the Static to the appropriate vardo to start the process. The Ky'ris is scrupulously fair within the laws of the Carnival. This may place it at odds with local custom, however.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some of the <a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">Eritsani</a> words have gotten mixed into the patterin of the Carnival. This is from contact with <a href="../npcs/kara.htm">Kara</a>, from deep memories from <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a>, and various other sources. The most common are:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ky’ris (KYEE rees) - final justice to which there can be no appeal, also the arbiters that assess this level of justice</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Prelaten (pray lah TAYN) - safety, security, sisterhood, attachment, and protection. This does not completely translate as it signifies a tie between the speaker and the hearer that goes beyond the words the Static have for similar concepts. A <a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">T'Sani</a> that utters this will come to the aid of the other regardless of the peril, if asked. The catch is the assistance must be asked for. Without the asking there is no obligation.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Kis Prelaten - a binding oath of friendship and assistance. Usually a token is passed to verify this bond although this is not strictly necessary. See the description of Prelaten for more detail.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Inrish te nygaresh la tredaln (This is written in air). - also la tredaln (in air - shortcut form) - This is an absolute thing. Air is the most valuable commodity to the <a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">T'Sani</a>. Without air there is no life. And the Carnival has briefly touched upon places where air was difficult to obtain.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Kia shith nyet alsheth Mayanish neshith tredaln - You do not beg the void for air. - as direct and unyielding as it sounds. This is often spoken when someone wrongly seeks mercy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Kayara</a> appears in two forms when with the Dark Carnival. The first is Old <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> the seer and Mistress of the Carnival, the other is the Steel Gazelle, the dancer of incredible beauty. (this form supercedes the Rose and Familiar of the Ravenloft Carnival). Only she knows when or why she will assume the other form. The Silent and the Speakers know of the duality of their leader, however, the Mayflies do not.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Speakers</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Old <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> - Carnival Mistress and Teller of Lives</p>

<p class="regtxt12"><a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> uses her gifts sparingly now, tending to let Mistress Estreya and her daughter Isabelle take the majority of querrents. She will only See for those that are nexus beings. Her attunement to the carnival grounds is such that she will immediately know when a nexus being has entered and will direct the Barkers and the Silent to guide the being to her.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Mistress Estreya and Isabelle - Tellers of Fortune</p>

<p class="regtxt12">This is a modified rip-off of Carnivale. Mistress Estreya slips into an apparent catatonic trance when Isabelle begins a reading. Isabelle's patter includes frequent exhortations to her mother to stay focused, to beg the spirits, and other fakeries to convince the petitioner that Estreya is the Seer and she is but the mouth-piece. Her daughter Isabelle reads the card for the petitioner, using a link through her mother. It is all an act. Isabelle has the more powerful version of the Sight, her mother acts in a supporting role. Estreya could do readings on her own, but they would be less detailed than those of her daughter. In reality, Isabelle is the physically weaker of the two. She is frail and easily winded. Moving from the bed to the reading table is hard. When she ventures out of her vardo she is always seen leaning heavily on her mother. Estreya is a Silent. Her masque is the impassive face of a high priestess.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Mishana</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Arcane, need to figure out her place in the carnival. She could run one of the booths of chance or have a performance part.</p>

<p class="regtxt9"> - Ringmaster</p>

<p class="regtxt12">figure out what show(s) or events he deals with and use Carson's costume as the basis for his look - should be something edgy and intense, whatever the event(s) turn out to be - look at <a href="http://www.showhistory.com">Show History</a> for ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Barkers</p>

<p class="regtxt12">At any one time there are several of these. They circulate through the carnival, calling acts, pointing out the performances of the Silent, selling admissions, and guiding the Static through the carnival wonders.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Vendors of the Exotic</p>

<p class="regtxt12">These are the food carts, the games of chance, and the sellers of oddities that are scattered about the carnival grounds.</p>

<p class="regtxt12"><a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_bbb.htm">Blood Bath and Beyond</a> will have a representative booth. This booth will sell basic to medium levels of gear. They will direct serious inquiries to the nearest frachise, when the Carnival is on a world with one.</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt12"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Silent</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Lady of Knives - Marta Neresh</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Marta's masque is a grinning skull face. She can throw any knife and hit any target. Knives she has made will pierce most lower order protective spells and do full damage to any target, even if it is protected by battle magic. She performs knife throwing demonstrations with Ilysha the Mime.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ilysha the Mime</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Ilysha can mimic anyone with minimal study. Under her masque, Ilysha is a Face Dancer adept of the highest level. Her masque is that of a classic mime. She is the high priestess of the Face Dancers. All prospectives must come to the Carnival and journey with it for a time. Part of the acquisition of Face Dancer skills is exposure to the void for at least half a year. All training takes place while the Carnival is journeying through the void.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Karyne and Tori - The Flying Twins</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The twins are wizards of the trapeze and other high wire apparatus. Part of their act has a carnival barker ask the audience for an arcane capable of detecting majik. This arcane is then asked to certify that no majik is in use when the twins perform. The arcane is not a plant. The twins perform their feats without any majik use. They share a telepathic link, allowing each one to see and hear everything the other is experiencing. <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> uses this from time to time, having one twin remain in her vardo, attached to a seeing device, while the other one ventures out into the surrounding areas. Their masques are identical intricate design of lines and curves in strange, yet pleasing, tattoo-like patterns. If one of the twins is sent on a spying mission, she will remove her masque for the duration. <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a> has created the masque for the twins such that its removal allows them to speak again.</p>

<p class="regtxt9"><a href="../../common/npc_images/sgazelle.htm"><img src="../../common/npc_images/sgazelle_thm.jpg" border=0> Vishina</a> - <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm#vishina">Steele Gazelle</a></p>

<p class="regtxt12"><a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Kayara</a>'s dancer guise. The Gazelle dances around the encampment. Her dances tend to be erotic and seductive, but she is cold as ice if propositioned. Many a Static has had his heart broken by the Gazelle's indifference when not in the heat of the dance. Her masque is an eye of horus pattern around her right eye.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Aralya - Fire Eater</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Aralya's masque is a red rose on her left cheek. She is a performer of fire, spinning it, eating it, and playing with it like it is a sentient, living thing. She wanders the midway while dancing with her flames.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Magrathea</p>

<p class="regtxt12">A woman in ragged skirts and tattered vest who dances randomly around the carnival ground. Her purpose is to synchronize the Carnival space with the timeline of the current <a href="multiverse.htm">Realm</a>. Her masque is two red tears dripping from her left eye and two blue tears dripping from her right one. When the the Carnival space and the timeline of the current <a href="multiverse.htm">Realm</a> are in sync all of the tears will be violet.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Rousties</p>

<p class="regtxt12"><a href="../../docs/docs_index.htm#alex">Alexandra</a></p>

<p class="regtxt15"><a href="../../docs/docs_index.htm#alex">Alex</a> is the master rigger, making sure all the critical rigging for performers and Carnival equipment is perfect and safe. She directs the other riggers and trains mayflies in the art. Her masque is an intricate semi-celtic knotwork pattern rendered in the shifting greens of the void.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">A catch all for the Silent that are not actively performing. They act as security once the carnival is set up. Their masques vary greatly, depending on their persona.</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt12"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Vardos</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Yara</a></p>

<p class="regtxt9">Yara's vardo is extremely ornate, worked in mystic symbols, strange beings, and colorful backgrounds gathered from countless worlds.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Contains a simple bed, small stove, ornate chest, locked with a 7 gem and dragon ball lock, and the Seeing Device. The Seeing Device is a thought crystal detector and display capable of detecting images and displaying them. Yara uses this with the help of the twins when she needs detailed information on a particular area. She will ask Karyne or Tori to remove their masque and venture into the target zone. The other twin will then wear the Seeing Device receptors and the two of them will watch and listen to the surroundings the remote twin is in. The device consists of two ornate crown-like headsets, one for the receiving twin and one for Yara. These items pick up the thoughts of the receiver and send them to the watcher. The receiver headset is set with rubies. The watcher headset is set with amethysts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Estreya and Isabelle</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ilysha</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Karyne and Tori</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Barkers</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Vendors</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rousties</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Equipment, props, supplies</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">"Winter" Quarters</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The carnival will occasionally take a break from traveling. When it does, it rests in a large clearing in the section of the <a href="../places/planescape/plains.htm">Plains of Concordant Discord</a> that is where the Hut <a href="../../hut_online/navsys.htm">Home 0</a> is located. If the Hut is in residence, one or more of the crew may visit.</p>

<p class="pagecaption">Dark Carnival in Legends and Myths</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">As a Traveling Entertainment</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At a basic level the carnival is seen as something different and dangerous. It is composed of the undesirables, the outcasts, and the freaks. This applies whether the view is of the carnival as legend or the carnival as just an traveling entertainment. Most Static view the carnival with suspicion and dread, even as many will attend it for the novelty of the experience.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Beware letting your children, lovers, or servants near the carnival. They might chose to run away with it and never be seen again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sure, there are fortune tellers with the carnival. Cheap parlour tricks to seduce the unwary. Who can't fabricate lies from a pack of pictures?</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">As a Legendary Event</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are many carnivals, but only one Dark Carnival. It roams the planar regions beyond the material, seeking souls to consume.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Dark Carnival is used to scare children and adults into compliance, "Beware lest the Dark Carnival steal you away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Dark Carnival travels between worlds. It can take you places beyond imagining, if you can convince the carnival master to let you go with them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Queen of the T'Sani travels with the Dark Carnival. She is the highest arbiter of T'Sani law. Appeal to her at your peril.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The T'Sani have a way of summoning the Dark Carnival. Few choose to do so as the price is high.</p>
