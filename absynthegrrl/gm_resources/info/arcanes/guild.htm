<p class="pagecaption">Guild of Arcanes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The applicant must have a POW + INT totaling greater than 32.  Then the applicant must roll a D100 with the result being less than the higher of his POW or INT multiplied by two.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Beings who are initiate level or higher in any cult will not be accepted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The applicant is accepted to an apprenticeship.  During this period the apprentice is taught majik theory and other majikal knowledge.  Cantrips are also used as teaching aids.  Each cantrip is an example of skills required to become an arcane thus all cantrips are taught to each apprentice.  The concept of reversing spells is also taught with practice being done with several of the cantrips.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Besides learning cantrips, the apprentice is taught to recognize the aura of magic.  This skill called Sense Magic will enable the arcane to read the aura of a magical item.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For each INT point of the apprentice 4 cantrips can be held in mind. For an apprentice to pass to first order he must know 6 cantrips at 90% proficiency, 3 cantrips at 75% proficiency, and 3 cantrips at 50% proficiency.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Upon completion of apprenticing the member will receive one use of the Find Familiar spell at 75% proficiency, and will be taught Read Magic at 1d6 plus Knowledge Bonus, Magical Lore (trainable only) at 1d4 plus Knowledge Bonus, Sense Magic at 1d6 Plus Perception Bonus, and two First Order spells at (1D6 + Majik Attack Bonus)%.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To acquire another spell of any Order all other spells of that Order must be at 50% proficiency or greater.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To acquire spells of the next higher Order the requirements shown in the chart at the end of this section must be met.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To progress past Third Order spells the member must journey to an Arcane test site and pass the test.  This test is simulated by three rolls of a D100.  The first roll must be less then STR * 3, the second roll must be less than CON * 3, and the third roll must be less than INT * 3.  If the test is successful then the person may learn Fourth through Sixth Order spells.  The member also gains the ability to have his INT * 2 spell points active in mind at any one time (spell points are the same as the Order of the spell  i.e. a Second Order spell counts as 2 spell points).  All spells of the first through third order become passive.  Successful completion also causes the Arcane to no longer be able to wear metal armor and use their Arcane spells, also all Battle Majik spells are lost.  If the test is failed the Arcane is limited to First through Third Order spells and will have absolutely no desire to ever take the test again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To progress past Sixth Order spells the member must again journey to an Arcane test site and pass the test.  This test is simulated by three rolls of a D100.  The first roll must be less than STR * 2, the second roll must be less than CON * 2, and the third roll must be less than INT * 2.  If the test is successful then the person may learn Seventh through Ninth Order spells.  The member also gains the ability to have his INT * 3 spell points active in mind at any one time.  All Active Spells first through sixth order become passive.  If the test is failed the Arcane is limited to First through Sixth Order spells and will have absolutely no desire to ever take the test again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To progress past Ninth Order spells the member must journey to an Arcane test site and pass the test.  This test is simulated by three rolls of a D100.  The first roll must be less than STR, the second roll must be less than CON, and the third roll must be less than INT.  If the test is successful then the person may learn Tenth Order and up spells.  The member also gains the ability to have his INT * 4 spell points active in mind at any one time (spell points are the same as the Order of the spell  i.e. a Second Order spell counts as 2 spell points).  All Active Spells of first through ninth order become passive.  If the test is failed the Arcane is limited to First through Ninth Order spells and will have absolutely no desire to ever take the test again.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Notes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Arcanes can have spells cast for them for 10% of public rates.  They can also have majik item identifies performed for 10% of the public cost.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spells may be kept "on hold" at the cost of one power point per melee round for as long as his concentration is only on that spell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spells may be learned from spell books.  Only spells of an Order equal to or less than the Arcane's current Order may be learned this way.  The procedure requires 3 weeks of continuous study for each Order of spell and then a roll of D100 <= INT * 3.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Normal spell learning at Arcane Guild Houses is 2 weeks per Order of spell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Casting times of spells depend on level. Spells of order equal to the arcane's current order require one melee round to cast. Spells lower than the arcane's current level require less time based on current level. Example: a third order arcane can cast third order spells in one melee round, second order spells take two thirds of a melee round, and first order spells take one third melee round. At fourth order it would take the arcane one melee round for a fourth order spell, 3/4 melee round for third order, 1/2 melee round for second order, and 1/4 melee round for first order.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When an arcane is first learning a spell gestures and vocalization are required to assist in the proper casting of the spell, these requirements decrease as follows:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An arcane must be at least 6th Order, have a permanent domicile, and have permission of the Guild Master of the area where his domicile is, before he may accept apprentices.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">MAJIKAL THEORY:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">New data:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Majik comes in several stengths. First there are spells that are scripted. This is items such as scrolls and wands. They contain frameworks that provide energy, majik intent, and control to produce a specific effect, with a specific stength. Nothing the user can do will alter these parameters.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Priest/god majik is similar to scripted majik, except the energy is provided by the godling the priest worships. The spell can only be as powerful as the energy cap in the spell or the energy limit of the godling, whichever is weaker.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Next is personal majik. In this case the arcane uses his will and personal energy to power a spell. The spell is a set of memorized patterns that channel and focus the energy to create the desired result. The power is provided from the arcane and can be varied up to the extent of the level of personal energy. The arcane can only draw as much energy as he has. In extreme cases he can draw himself to exhaustion or until he passes out, but cannot serious hurt himself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The most powerful form of majik is amplified majik. In this case the arcane draws energy from around herself, using her will to modulate it into the disred result. Careful control must be maintained otherwise the arcane can draw too much energy and burn out her own nerves, creating neural burn, which usually results in death. There are utility spells that can be used to enhance the arcane;s power handling abilities. These come in many forms, from items and artifacts that must be worn, to spells that create specialized pathways in the flesh of the arcane.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Previous data:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Majik is the weaving of energies into different patterns to achieve desired results. Each spell or pattern producing a specific result must be learned by intense study of either majik books and writings or from an arcane that already knows the spell. Each spell consists of several distinct sections, the first section prepares the arcane's awareness and concentration allowing him to visualize the energies used to create the desired pattern, the second section is the "weaving" of the actual pattern using the psychic power of the arcane himself, the third section of the spell is where any additional external energy is drawn in and focused (additional personal energy may be needed in this step to control the additional energies drawn in dependent on quantity), the fourth (and final) section is the directing or targeting of the spell so that the results are where and when the arcane desires.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spells are taught as a complete pattern to the new arcane and only as his skill and capabilities grow is he able to figure out how to change the amount of external energy he draws in for spells with variable levels of effect. Often external items, material components, are used to help focus and aid in concentration on specific spells.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Identify majik allows an arcane to try and follow the patterns of majik existing on the desired item or area and the chance to try and recognize the patters involved.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At 12th Order the arcane has access to an "anti-dispell" spell. This spell basically inserts an encrypted section of pattern into the overall pattern of an enchantment placed on an item or area. This encrypted section is indecipherable to anyone other than the casting arcane. It prevents anyone but the original caster from unweaving the enchantment pattern. It can also be used to mask some of the enchantment's effects.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Extensive research of items and spells produced by a single arcane may (2%) give enough information to bypass the encryption code of that particular arcane. This requires a minimum of 5 items, 10 spells, or a mix of the two, with spells counting 2 for each item not used, and 4 + 1d4 zyrodyls continuous research.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Major artifacts will have a set method of destruction which is independent of any encryption codes present in their construction.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">FAMILIARS:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Upon acceptance into the Guild of Arcanes the new member receives one use of the Find Familiar spell.  The type of familiar summoned is as shown in ADD Players Handbook pg. 66.</p>


<p class="regtxt5">Benefits:  The familiar adds CON points to the Arcane with every two CON points the familiar has adding one point to the Arcane.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For 1 - 3 Order Arcanes the familiar functions as a Bound Spirit for both POW and INT considerations.  It also allows the Arcane to see and hear with the Familiar's senses while the familiar is within a five kilometer range of the Arcane.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For 4 - 6 Order Arcanes, the familiar functions as a Bound Spirit but with no limit on vision or hearing senses.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For Arcanes 7th Order and higher, the familiar functions as a Rune status character's Allied Spirit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Drawbacks: If the familiar is killed the Arcane looses 6 permanent POW points and the number of CON points added by the familiar multiplied by 1.5.  The CON points are regained at the rate of 1 point per month.
<p class="regtxt5">To gain another familiar the Arcane must purchase another use of the Find Familiar spell.</p>
