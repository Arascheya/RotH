<p class="regtxt5">WINE TO POISON: Duration: 5 melee, Range: Touch, Area of Effect: One Container of Wine.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The arcane must touch the wine itself, the wine is then a poison of a potency equal to the arcane's power at the time of casting.  After 5 melee the wine is just wine, and an arcane of 7th Order or greater is needed to detect that the wine was magically tampered with.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">WIND: Duration: 1 melee round, Range: Special, Area of Effect: Special.</p>

If the being is overcome it is knocked off its feet, if it is not overcome then it is just staggering.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The steady breeze causes small flames to dance about, it fans flames and fires of larger size making them hotter, it will hold back moving clouds of vapor for the duration of the wind, and it will move stagnant air and poisonous gasses in the direction it is blowing.</p>
