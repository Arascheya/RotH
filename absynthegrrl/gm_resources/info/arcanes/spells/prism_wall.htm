<p class="pagecaption">Prismatic Walls - from Arduin Grimoire 1</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Within the realms of the various "dungeon worlds" there rages a controversy over just what a prismatic wall is, and how it may be used.  Therefore in order to shed some
more light on the matter, I herewith describe how they are thought of and used within the
borders of Arduin.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A prism is most often used to separate the colors of light, not to combine them
(giving one plain white light).  Because of this we see prismatic walls as separate colors,
each with a different property and magical effect, thus giving rise to many different types
of prismatic walls all differentiated by color!  Here is a list of the known types of
prismatic walls and their properties:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*Special note:  Prismatic walls, when looked upon, have all of the capability to hurt, etc. as outlined in other available gaining, systems.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">**Indicates that the only way to nullify that particular form of wall is to have a "dispell magic" of equal or greater level than the level of the mage putting the wall up!</p>
<p class="regtxt5">***This means that the entity trying to penetrate this wall psychically must himself save versus psychic attack or suffer "mindwipe."  And, dear readers, mindwipe is exactly
what it says I  The luckless person has his entire memory, ego, sum of himself, sucked from him and utterly and permanently destroyed I  He (or she or even it) become complete and total non-thinking beings.  They can never again be anything but a mindless robot responding to other people's commands (and even that capability takes 1-6 months  per each command "learned" (and never more than 10 command-limited responses be learned)).</p>
<p class="regtxt5">****This means that all dragon attacks, whether physical, "breath" or even magical will fail.  The only magical attack that the dragon could make effectively would be the afore mentioned "trigger" spell.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">One further note;  Anyone seeing a prismatic wall with "true sight" has a 5% chance per level less than 20th of going permanently insane, and even if he does not, he will be
"psychically stunned" for 2-20 months and will stand around staring, incapable of voluntary
speech, movement or even coherent thought.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Special Note on Life Level (undead drains, etc.):  Experience earned levels that are magically or otherwise blasted away may not be regained in any way except by:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">a) wishes;</p>
<p class="regtxt9">b) earning more experience.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Life levels lost to blood drains (or lost by unintelligent creatures from any cause) may be regained by absolute rest at the rate of one level per month.  If that rest is broken for any reason, the healing process stops and may never be restarted for those particular lost levels.</p>
