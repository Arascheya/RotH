<p class="pagecaption">Scatter Items</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Basic Scatter: Order: 10th; Casting Time: See GM.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This spell takes a collection of items and scatters them throughout the multi-verse. This is usually done to prevent any further use of the items in question. No provision is included for keeping track of where the items went.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Enhanced Scatter: Order: 16th</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This adds a mechanism for using Basic Scatter to hide the items rather than just scattering them. In this instance the items to be scattered and a gem worth at least 100 Stars must be present at the casting of the spell. The items are scattered to the multi-verse and their locations are stored in the gem. The gem contains a low level geas that will draw the user to the location of each scattered item in a sequence the original caster devised. This geas is triggered the instant the gem is touched by bare flesh. The geas can be set hard or soft. A hrad geas will force the user to abandon all other interests until the geas is complete. A soft geas will allow the target full control over their actions, but with a nagging desire to follow the geas in question.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Careful examination with various majik detection and analysis spells can extract all the locations from the gem and provide them in a distributable format.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Encoded Scatter: Order: 25th</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This spell will take an item, break it into component pieces, and scatter these to the multi-verse. It will encode the locations into the Locator Gem and encrypt the data so only the geased holder of the gem can track the items. The gem must have been at least 1000 Stars in value before the casting of this spell. The activation of the geas can be set to trigger on a specific set of circumstances. When this is used, the Locator Gem will not radiate majik of any form before activate. The geas can be set hard or soft. A hrad geas will force the user to abandon all other interests until the geas is complete. A soft geas will allow the target full control over their actions, but with a nagging desire to follow the geas in question.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The area of dispersal can also be specified in this version of the spell. It can be as tight as confined to a single world in real-space, or to a particular plane, or to the multi-verse at large. The caster must carefully visualize and define the target zone when casting the spell to effect this result.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is no method to extract the locations from the encoding in the Locator Gem. Unweaving and decoding the basic spells on the gem will render it useless, but not reveal any of the location data.</p>
