Picking up the ball will also dispel the magic.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The ball can roll up hill on a shallow grade (30 degrees or less) but will be stopped by stair steps, thorns, mud etc.  It will back track to find a way around steep places but it is not smart enough to keep from falling into rivers, rat holes etc.  The ball will unwind at the same rate as a man walks.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The original clue gets a POW vs POW if the spell misses the string will incorrectly translate the clue.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The duration of the spell depends on the intelligence of the being as well as the actions of the caster.  The spell is broken if the caster attacks the being, there is also the possibility of the spell being broken if a member of the caster's party attacks the being.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">FLARE: Duration: Special, Range: 100m</p>

<p class="regtxt9">With this spell, the arcane causes an intensely bright, yellow/white spark to zip from the tip of his middle finger.  This spark moves at 100m per second to a distance of 100m and bursts into a brilliant, but utterly harmless, 2m ball of light.  This light casts the equivalent of half day light in a 60m radius about the ball of light.  This light will slowly drift downward at the rate of 1m per second.  If it hits any solid object it will go out.  During the initial firing only it can and does ricochet off any solid object.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">FLOAT: Duration: 10 minutes per Order, Range: 20m per Order, Area of Effect: One Object up to 100lbs per Order, Spell Type: Active.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This spell produces a large bubble of air, that will take the shape the caster wants, under the target item.  Allowing the target item to float on or near the surface of any liquid.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Sunken items can be raised as long as the arcane knows where they are and they are with in the limits of this spell.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This spell will remove any an all particulate matter from the air (smoke, dust, fog, etc.).  This spell creates a mild draft as it works.  In addition to cleaning the air it lightly scents the area.  It is available in evergreen, lemon, herbal, fresh sea air, and spice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">FRIENDS: Duration: 2 minutes, Range: 80m, Area of Effect: Self</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Adds half again to Charisma for the duration of the spell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">HAWK VISION: Duration: 4 hours, Range: Touch, Area of Effect: One set of eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This spell gives the target vision similar to a 10x power telescope.  This vision can be switched on and off by the user for the duration of the spell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">HASTE: Duration: 10 melee, Range: 80m, Area of Effect: One Being.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This spell will double the movement class of the recipient.  This spell effects movement only.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">HEALING: Duration: Permanent, Range: Touch, Area of Effect: One Being, Spell Type: Active.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">With this spell the arcane can either heal a specific wound or over all body damage.  If the arcane touches a wound when casting this spell then it is the wound touched that is healed, or the arcane can touch a none hurt area and have the healing flow evenly through out the injured person's body.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The amount healed is 1d4+ 1 point per level of arcane, with the arcane being able to adjust the amount of healing done once he is past 4th level.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This spell heals one point of damage per strike rank and the arcane must be concentrating on the healing through out the spell casting and healing otherwise the spell is broken.  If the spell is broken the healing stops at that point and the arcane looses all the POW required to cast the spell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">IDENTIFY: Duration: Instant, Range: Touch, Area of Effect: One item.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The caster matched his power against the power of the item, if he is successful he will know one ability of the item.  The cost of this spell is one power point per ability of item.  Each ability requires a separate power vs. power.  For example the flaming sword that does 3 to 18 points of damage would cost 1 point of power to find out it flames, 1 more point of power would tell the caster that the minimum is 3 points of damage, the next point would tell the caster 4, then another would tell him 5, up until he reached 18 twice in a row.  Thus to fully identify this sword would cost the caster 19 points of power provided he made all of the power vs. power rolls.  Once a power vs. power roll is missed the caster must improve his spell use percentage for this spell, at which point he starts all over again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">LIGHT: Duration: 1 hour or until dispelled, Range: 80m, Area of Effect: Special.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MENDING: Duration: Permanent, Range: Touch, Area of Effect: One item.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">With this spell the caster can repair broken non-magical items.  Each casting of this spell repairs 20 points of damage.  This spell does not create matter so all the pieces have to be there and they have to be fitted together correctly.  Note: magical items maybe repaired but then their magical properties are forever lost.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MESSAGE: Duration: 1 melee round per every two Orders, Range: Sight.</p>
