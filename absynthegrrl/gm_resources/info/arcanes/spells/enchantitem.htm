<p class="pagecaption">Enchant Item</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Order: 4th; Casting Time: See GM.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This spell creates the framework pattern that is combined with another spell to bind it into an item.  Preliminary defining patterns must be placed on all parts of the item to be enchanted (all pieces of the set of armor, both boots, etc.) during its construction phase (as near as possible to the beginning of construction as possible, usually after the components have been gathered but before item assembly).  Once construction is complete, the rest of the Enchant Item Spell pattern is woven together with the other spell and is placed on the item.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This produces an item with a magic spell in it that requires external Power to activate the spell.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When used with Mend, magical items can be repaired.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Order: 7th</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To get this spell the arcane needs the 4th Order Enchant Item at 75% or better.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Functions similar to the 4th Order variety but allows multiple spells to be woven into the enchantment pattern.  Also allows the arcane to tie a Spirit Binding spell into the framework of spells.  Thus allowing a spirit to be bound into an item so that the attuned owner can select where the item's spells are powered from.  The owner may use the bound spirit in the normal fashion as well. When summoning spirits for this purpose the desire is to get intelligent ones that can communicate with the owner of the item.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Charge Spell is also usable at this level.  With the Charge Spell the arcane can store a set number of "charges" of the designated spell in an item.  These items may be recharged if they are recharged before running out of the initial charges.  The Power stored by the Charge Spell comes from the arcane or a power device attuned to him.  Several Days may be taken to build up higher number of charges.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Order: 10th</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To get this spell the arcane needs the 7th Order Enchant Item at 75% or better.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Allows the arcane to bind a spirit to an item and designate what spells the spirit will automatically power.  This is where the X number of uses per day items come from.  In this case the bound spirit is not available to the item's owner for use.  This requires Spirit Binding and a Permanency Spells to link the spirit power to the appropriate spell.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Order: 13th</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To get this spell the arcane needs the 10th Order Enchant Item at 75% or better.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Allows the arcane to create an item with effect(s) that are always active.  Requires the sacrifice of permanent POW points and the use of the Permanency Spell.  Power cost is one Permanent POW point per spell point.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The spell Spirit Power allows the arcane to sacrifice permanent power from his bound spirits, instead of himself.  The existence of this spell is only hinted at 13th Order and is available at 15th Order.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Order: 16th</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To get this spell the arcane needs the 13th Order Enchant Item at 75% or better.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This spell allows encryption to be added to the created item. An encrypted item cannot be destroyed with dispel magic or other standard enchantment destroying techniques. To destroy or nullify an encrypted item the dispeller must study as many items created by the item’s creator as possible. The dispeller must gain enough of an understanding of the creator to be able to decrypt the creator’s pattern before any other dispelling can occur.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dispelling is dangerous because there is a great deal of energy bound up in the encryption spell structure. If the decryption is not complete this energy is released through the dispeller as they attempt to take apart the rest of the spells.</p>
