<p class="pagecaption">Powers and Alliances - Valen</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Military - old guard - removed by Valen’s block whenever they are found. They believe in the old principles of the Alliance government structure. They consistently opposed Valen and her remodeling of the government. A few have attempted to maintain low profiles and mitigate the changes from within.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Military - new guard - support Valen, mostly, until she begins her programs of social engineering which are designed to remove conflict based resolution of differences. She intends to reduce military presence and power in all areas except proven hot spots, and to attempt negotiated treaties even there.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Secret Service - old mechanism of Alliance to protect political figures. They also provided some local security enforcement</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Security Police - new group, formed from part of secret service - tasked to protect Valen in all situations. They were also chartered to provide her with information about what other segments of her government were doing. Their leader found he could manipulate Valen by feeding her doctored information. She figured out what he was doing and has created alternative info paths to compare with info from SecPol. She has not yet seen a clear cut case of cooked info, thus she has not moved to revamp or eliminate the current SecPol power block.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="talons.htm">Talons</a> - smuggling group - working to become the most powerful of them. Each of the seven talons has their own agenda, but there is a unifying theme of us/them at work, plus a unified set of basic operating principles. Talon 1 ( the one with Elentaryn’s father) is allied with Valen and is one of her alternate information pathways. He feeds her info so she will continue to ignore certain events and she reciprocates to have access to a group she can use for extra legal activities if she has need. They have provided courier and spy services on several occasions. Atrayas was part of the intelligence service when Valen was. They became good friends during several missions. The talons function like many extended families - there are squabbles within, but an external attack instantly provokes a unified front and response.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Intelligence Services - provide intelligence about worlds within the Alliance, now Imperium, and provide information and covert activities on worlds outside at this point. Valen and several others began their actual political machinations while within this group. Others that formed part of her original group of supporters include Atrayas, Torzelth, and 10 others, including Torzelth’s companion.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Regional Governors - all have their own programs and agendas. These are the most damaging to Valen’s overall plans. Many of them implement programs on their worlds that she never hears about that would be in direct violation of her master plans. Many employ their own security and intelligence groups and attempt to infiltrate each other and Valen’s groups. They thrive under the reduced system of checks and balances that exist under Valen’s regime. She has not yet been able to find a good center ground between overbearing bureaucracies of blatant despotism, depending on the levels of checks attempted on each grouping of civil servants. They are one of the biggest reasons for her reliance on the talons and others like them for independent information flow.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her Assistant - linked with Razaks for assistance and ships. Need to figure out why.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Razaks - desire freedom to once more expand throughout the galaxy and cleanse it. They are weak right now, mostly in lack of ships, weaponry, and raw materials. They are also low in numbers from being confined to a single world. They will need to spread, reproduce and acquire more resources before they can begin a new cleansing campaign.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Various non-Talon smugglers and pirate groups - most function as small independent groups with goals no more severe than accumulating wealth from raiding. Most are only a threat within their small area of operation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Various human and non-human races and colonies - each will have a set of needs/wants that won’t always work nicely with their neighbors.</p>
