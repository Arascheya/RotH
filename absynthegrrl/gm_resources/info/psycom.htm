<p class="pagecaption">PsyCom</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Developers of military technology, implants, and enhancements for use by nation-state and corporate armed forces. Rumors periodically link PsyCom to strange virii in net-space and in localized outbreaks in real-space. To date none of these have been proven.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Internally PsyCom employees are using equipment that is rarely released to the public.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">PsyCom disappears at the time of the last great diaspora, as do many other Mega Corps., victims of the rapid flight from the homeworld.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">PsyCom is revived in the time of <a href="../npcs/valen.htm">Valen</a> as <a href="psytech.htm">PsyberTech Systems</a>. Someone comes across an obscure reference to the name and cyber implants when they are setting up a company to begin that type of research. See <a href="psytech.htm">PsyberTech Systems</a> as well for info about <a href="../npcs/valen.htm">Valen</a>'s time. It is the company that Sarah Draybin's parents work for and the one that gives <a href="../npcs/valen.htm">Valen</a> her implants.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">PsyCom is destroyed during the Cyber Wars. Valen's adoptive parents are killed along with everyone else at the facility. Once in a while rumors surface of a secret data backup location elsewhere. So far none of the rumors has pointed to anything real though. Valen keeps hoping, although the hope fades a little more each year.</p>
