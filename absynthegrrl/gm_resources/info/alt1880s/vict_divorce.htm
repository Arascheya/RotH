<p class="regtxt5">The Divorce Bill</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Before 1857, you could only get a divorce if you applied to Parliament for a private Act. It was a process far beyond the means of most ordinary people, and only four women had ever achieved a divorce in this way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The situation was ironically (and famously) summed up by Mr Justice Maule on 1 April 1845. Detailing the tedious and expensive process for obtaining a divorce, he concluded to a man accused of bigamy: '...altogether you would have had to spend about a thousand or twelve hundred pounds. You will probably tell me that you've never had a thousand farthings of your own in the world. But Prisoner, that makes no difference. This is not a country in which there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">From 1850 onwards there had been efforts to get a Bill put through Parliament to set up a divorce court. <a href="reformers.htm">Caroline Norton</a>, herself the victim of an abusive marriage, was an active campaigner for the Act.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857 allowed secular divorce for the first time in England and also achieved some significant victories for women. Under the Act</p>

<p class="regtxt5">a court could order a husband to pay maintenance to a divorced or estranged wife</p>

<p class="regtxt5">a divorced wife could inherit or bequeath property in her own right</p>

<p class="regtxt5">a divorced wife could protect her earnings from a husband who had deserted her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was one respect, though, in which the new Act was weighted in favour of men. A husband only had to prove that his wife had committed adultery but a woman had to prove adultery plus either incest, bigamy, cruelty or desertion.</p>
