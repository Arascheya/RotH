<p class="regtxt5">This cross world, cross-dimensional trading group is the most reliable source for goods from other places. They are based in the City of Doors and are broken into two groups. The first is the public face of the organization. Thsese people are friendly, personable shop keepers, eager to befriend serious customers. The second is the dimension walkers. These are the altered, changed beings who walk the Gate Dimension between places, moving the goods between them. They are kept from the public eye to prevent negative reaction, and because they are changed and damaged enough to be dngerous.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Free Trade is partnered with <a href="umbreylla.htm">Um Brey Lla Alchemy</a> for the distributoin of high end foodstuufs, beverages, and other exotic biological based items.</p>
