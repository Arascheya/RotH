<p class="regtxt5">Hyperdrive units operate by generating a 3 fold field structure. The first field stabilizes and protects the ship from the enormous stresses experienced in entry and return from hyperspace. It is often refered to as the Capsule Field. The second field, the Translation Field, is the field actually responsible for the entry to and exit from hyperspace. It creates a dimensional construct around the Capsule Field that is incompatible with real space. Real space acts on this field to force it into it’s correct dimension set in an abrupt almost quantum tunneling. The final field, the Director Field, is a modulation field that is summed and differenced with the Translation Field and causes hyperspace to push on the capsule bubble in uneven ways, thus squirting it through hyperspace until the Translation Field is altered to force re-entry into real space. Entry into various dimensional sets is possible. Given the danger levels of some of these sets there are built in constraints that prevent the translation field from being altered. Damage to the constraint units is considered one of the most severe malfunctions a hyperdrive unit can sustain, basically at the same danger level as antimatter containment failure.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Magical gating works under the same principles with the magic user providing the patterns for the three required fields and drawing the energies from the universe around them. Translation is the most dangerous time since any loss of concentration can interfere with proper translation and protection field maintenance. Since there is no built in constraint device, there is a very high risk of translation into a lethal dimension set.</p>
