<p class="regtxt5">This could be morphed into an actual page - for now it is a listing of data that will be shown on the Realms of the Hut game web pages.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Realms of the Hut takes place across a multiverse of worlds. On every world there are nexus events occurring between the polarities of all races. These polarities include Law, Order, Chaos, Anarchy, Good, Evil, Light, and Dark. Each player will choose their own ethos and beliefs and these will evolve over time as they explore more of the Realms around them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While the choice of Polarity can seem obvious at the first, it is important to remember the multiverse suffers as much under too much Law as too much Anarchy, too much Good as too much Evil. Because of this, there is a last group, working from the shadows, to prevent the multiverse from tearing itself apart. These are the Keepers of the Balance. The exact ways in which Keepers are recruited is not known, only that some are called and few accept.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Within the Realms of the Hut your character's actions will change the face of destiny across the multiverse. There will be epic battles between the various Polarities as each group strives for supremacy. Sometimes the fate of the many depends on the actions of the few. You have the chance to be one of the few and carve your fame across the ages.</p>
