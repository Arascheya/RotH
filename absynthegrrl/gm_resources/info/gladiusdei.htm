<p class="pagecaption">Gladius Dei</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gladius Dei are the enforcement arm of The Church. They answer directly to the reigning pope. Throughout history they have been inquisitors, special forces, and the hit squad for the papacy. Officially, they were disbanded in the late 1940's, by papal decree. Unofficially, they are as strong as ever.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The current leader of the Gladius has made it his personal crusade to find and destroy the <a href="gate_mons.htm">Monitors</a>, considering them to be servants of Satan and minions of the underworld. The Gladius also target any Awakened when they find out about them. Considering these people to be irredeemably contaminated and deserving only of death.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gladius Dei has their headquarters in the Citadel of the Holy Sword, connected to the  City of Light, located in the city of Emra, Tialia. The leader is under demonic influence from a group of beings seeking the release of the Destructor.</p>
