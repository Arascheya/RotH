<p class="regtxt5">Gladius Dei are the enforcement arm of The Cothloc Church. They answer directly to the reigning hierophant. Throughout history they have been inquisitors, special forces, and the hit squad for the hierophancy. Officially, they were disbanded in the late 1940's, by hierophant decree. Unofficially, they are as strong as ever.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The current leader of the Gladius has made it his personal crusade to find and destroy the <a href="gate_mons.htm">Monitors</a>, considering them to be servants of Satan and minions of the underworld. Gladius also seeks the forbidden tome, Gates of the Web Queen, and the path to power they think it represents. They also seek Gate control items so they can spread through the void, onto other realms, and establish power bases there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gladius Dei has their headquarters in the Citadel of the Holy Sword, connected to the Cothloc City of Light, located in the city of Emra, Tialia Rome, Italy). The leader is either under demonic influenceor a demonic himself. This being is amember of the Cult of the Destructor, seeking to free the same and bring on the end of the multi-verse.</p>
