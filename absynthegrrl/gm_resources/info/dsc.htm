<p class="pagecaption">DSC Starship - Drunken Sailer Constructors</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The name started as a joke because early DSC ships were somewhat less than perfect in terms of dimensions and squareness. All these imperfections were cosmetic. A DSC ship could withstand an amasing amount of punishment before failing, making them a favortite among the <a href="../places/karanal/fringesys.htm">Fringe Systems</a> and Independent Frieghter crowds. Also, because of the imperfections, they were willing to sell at lower margins than many of the <a href="../places/karanal/coresys.htm">Core Systems</a> manufacturers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">DSC and <a href="yes.htm">YES</a> are the linked extensions of <a href="ciwl_etc.htm">ITC</a> from the <a href="losthome.htm">old home world</a>.</p>
