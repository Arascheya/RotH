<p class="regtxt5">Realms of the Hut is under development by CyCore games. See <a href="http://rothonline.wikidot.com/">Design Specs</a> for more information on the game itself. (<a href="roth_wikidump.htm">raw dump</a> of data for local work)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Game design to ship will take four years. Rani Corp provides funding and contracts with CyCore to develop. There is much conflict about business models, ratings, and content between CyCore and Rani Corp. CyCore is worried about their reputation when they ship a game that will support fully adult content and situtations.</p>

                CyCore Games, creator of 'Conflict for Mars' and the Shadow Journeys series, announces development of a new massively multiplayer online role playing game for personal computers and gaming stations. Taking place in the multi-verse that includes our world, 'The Realms of the Hut' places the players in the conflicts between the powers and forces conspiring to dominate the known worlds.<br/>

                In The Realms of the Hut, anything could be true. Portals between worlds can be found anywhere, enemies and allies may be as near as next door, in the depths of the Abyss, or in the groves of the Elysian Fields, and monsters really do lurk under the bed.<br/>

                Journey alone or join forces with your friends and seek out the truths behind the myths, battle the forces seeking power, and create your own legends. The fate of the multi-verse is in your hands.<br/>

                For more information see <a href="roth_web.htm">roth.cycore.com</a>.<br/>
                Note: all items below are available through the Pre-Launch client only. Regular email updates will be covered elsewhere.

                Image in browser of a heart shaped sapphire stone, a rock shadowing it, and a sun in the background.<br/>
                Dragging the sapphire into the sun results in a deep gong sound being played and a pop-up asking permission to download the Realms of the Hut pre-game client. The client is described as a portal to exclusive interactive pre-launch games giving access to Realms of the Hut places, artwork, character special enhancements, and other items to increase interest. Accepting the client installs a pre-game client that is used for all future pre-launch activities.<br/>
                Once the client is installed, an image is displayed showing an eight sided room with a boarded over door in every other wall. The other four walls were floor to ceiling shelves of books. In the center was a small table with an oil lamp burning. Its glow was the only light in the room. There was a small grey cloth bound book on the table, next to the lamp, and an age darkened, soot streaked bronze bell hanging from the ceiling. A wooden mallet was hanging next to it. It is possible to use the mouse to explore the room. All the books on the shelf are pale and ghost-like. None can be interacted with.<br/>
                Nothing happens if the hammer is dragged to strike the bell.<br/>
                The book can be opened to the first page and will display the following text:<br/>
                The Realms of the Hut takes place across a multiverse of worlds. On every world there are nexus events occurring between the polarities of all races. These polarities include Law, Order, Chaos, Anarchy, Good, Evil, Light, and Dark. Each player will choose their own ethos and beliefs and these will evolve over time as they explore more of the Realms around them.<br/>

                While the choice of Polarity can seem obvious at the first, it is important to remember the multiverse suffers as much under too much Law as too much Anarchy, too much Good as too much Evil. Because of this, there is a last group, working from the shadows, to prevent the multiverse from tearing itself apart. These are the Keepers of the Balance. The exact ways in which Keepers are recruited is not known, only that some are called and few accept.<br/>

                Within the Realms of the Hut your character's actions will change the face of destiny across the multiverse. There will be epic battles between the various Polarities as each group strives for supremacy. Sometimes the fate of the many depends on the actions of the few. You have the chance to be one of the few and carve your fame across the ages.<br/>

                The bell makes a deep, clear, bell tone and a white flash seems to drift through the room. In it's wake, a small scrap of parchment drifts down to the table. A quill pen and inkwell fade into view near it. Examining the parchment shows a line of text "A rose red city half as old as time" and a blank line with the pen hovering over it.

                Notes of Irena Katarya<br/>
                Statics<br/>
                A woman once asked me, "Don't you want to settle down, raise a family, become a part of a community?"<br/>
                All I could think was, "Only in my worst nightmares. To be ground bound, stuck on some gods forsaken rock, would be a hell from which I would run screaming. I embraced the Hut of All Worlds, the Hut of Margla Fleshfeaster. I reveled in the knowledge that I could go anywhere and any when, and never have I regretted the price of admission."

The sandbox aspect allows players to challenge current power groups and supplant them through combat, tactics, or subterfuge. All power blocks are held by characters controlled by CyCore or Rani Corp personel at the launch of the game. After that, all positions are fair game except for the Three Sisters.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sandbox also allows for things such as plays who just want to set up in a city and provide shops, services, or other items for other players. Figure out methods for these players to advance, should they desire to.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Missions</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Missions are "canned" items available to players at various points in the world. They are a way to learn more about the world, see new places, and acquire items. Missions are intended to enhance and supplement the sandbox apects of the environment. Missions are available from found items, places, NPCs, or CyCore run Player Characters.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">New players will encounter missions immediately after Character Creation. The first mission will be to fix their Hut. A few additional missions could be included for tutorial aspects before the new players are exposed to the sandbox.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Misc Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Return Home - either first time in Hut or first time can return to Place of Origin</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This is fairly simple to imagine. What if your old home, whether that room you were in was a house or an apartment complex, became more than a backdrop for the game's opening?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I can imagine some possibilities for this. The first would turn your apartment into a quest location, where another person or group of people have become the owners of the place, and you're called to recruit them into your cabal because your place apparently likes making anima-infused people. What if your apartment was haunted? What if, like in Cabin in the Woods, you went back to get a memento, and the memento you choose in the game made you face a terrible horror based on that memento?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">It's a fun idea, and one that tries to add layers to the backstory of your character.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Notes:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">ARG starts before the Gates are discovered. At the start time it is assumed recruits will be immediately pulled from their realms of origin and placed elsewhere. Once Rani Corp knows of the Gates, the ARG will be modified so it starts in the current realm. Shift in paradigm will occur before the first link out of the library chamber is set. Need to determine where the link leads.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Need to create "design bible" prototype containing as much data about the game world as possible, inclucding weapons, clothes, areas, interactions, and other aspects of the game. This is what Nyissa, Jaime, and Irena focus on as the game is built.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Engine Needs</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Avatar Support</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Multiple character races, NPC races, easy clothing and appearance changing for on-going customization</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Support pregnancy, weight gain or loss, and aging?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">UI</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Support undocking of elements for multiple monitor cases</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Support API for cutom interface devices, gloves, eye projectors, etc.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Map system, including map pins and a system for adding notes, support posting of notes and locations to social media and allowing friends to see current location on web maps, etc.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Movement System</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Support horses, wagons, vehicles?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Support ships, piracy? How to deal with movement over ocean - like WoW, other?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Try for seamless zone transitions?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Combat</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Melee, ranged - single target, area of effect, magical - single target, area of effect</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Define supprted weapons types</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Economy</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Define economy methodology - cash, trade, barter, all or some of these?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Balance any cassh economies in terms of cash in and cash out to prevent easy money but also prevent casual players from ending up "locked out" of access to optional, social, or vanity items</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Crafting</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Support resource gathering and assembly into useful items</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Support NPC and PC shops - provide apprenticeship, purchase system for PCs to aquire shop space and methods on running it</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Social</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Need easy UI for Emotes, simple access to test chat, voice chat support, social media support</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Voice Chat Support</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Use third party API as basis. Verify voice changing headsets don't cause trouble.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">At least one company provides a headset that allows the user to program in a voice shift for playing alternate gender characters. Advanced mode allows for serious tweaking of timber, pitch, accent, etc.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Other</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Support for user created content - in the form of Hut customization, clothing design, creation, sale, user defined Realms - all will require RotH team vetting before being placed on official servers.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Local server test harness for development of customized items. Support login from other players by invitation. Must not compromise security by allowing players to cheat the game.</p>
