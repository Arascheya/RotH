<p class="regtxt5">Stations come in three basic designs - spun (Spun), artificial gravity (AG), and Ground Based(GB). All older stations are spun. Newer stations are designed based on artificial gravity unless there is a need to keep power costs minimized. Artificial gravity is significantly more expensive than spun gravity. AG stations have the advantage of being able to selectively turn down/off the gravity for cargo handling, construction, etc.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Spun stations often utilize <a href="dock_sys.htm">Type 2</a> docking bays primarily. Some external docking can be accommodated along the spin axis of the station. Angular velocity from station spin and alterations in driven station mass make Type 1 docking difficult to implement. Thus it tends to be restricted to emergency situations only. Very often the docking areas are small so anything larger than an SLF class ship must park nearby and use station or ship shuttles to move personnel and cargo.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">AG stations tend to favor <a href="dock_sys.htm">Type 1</a> docking. Less internal space is required. Without the angular velocity worries ships can be clustered off easily expanded access galleries. Station security is simplified by being able to screen anyone coming out of a particular gallery.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ground Based stations - tend to be more spread out than orbiting stations. Cargo ships are more likely to be seperated from passenger liners and the whole passenger, security set-up. Ship traffic is limited to shuttles, SLF freighters , smaller private ships, and grav-repulsion corgo lifters.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">All types of stations have varying levels of hassle depending on local government regs. There is also more hassle at the borders between the Core Systems and the Fringe Worlds.</p>
