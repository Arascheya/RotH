<p class="pagecaption">Starship Companies - Notes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The small carriers and independents are fading away with more and more traffic being taken over by the corporates. They swallow up the younger spacers and displace the older ones. Many of the family companies are bought out at good prices, until you figure at least half the family will never work again in space - then the intangible price becomes quite high. The corporates can afford the high cost of automated equipment and multiple safety redundancies. They have forced through regulations requiring much of this equipment for access to the Core Systems and this has forced the remaining independents more into the Fringe Systems, where the regs tend to be more lax. The high tech stuff is often only supported on the more affluent worlds, which works against a universal adoption of the regs. This loop hole is what keeps the independents viable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The independents end up with the less lucrative runs. As a result, most of them are one or two runs away from bankruptcy. Many cannot afford catastrophic repairs and go under if something major happens to their ship.</p>
