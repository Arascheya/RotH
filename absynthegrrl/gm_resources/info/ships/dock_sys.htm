<p class="sectioncaption">Type 1:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ships are tethered to the station using several docking clamps to form a stabile connection between the ship and Station. A crew access tube and maybe a passenger access tube is/are deployed for personnel movements and small cargo handling, baggage and such. Station utilities are connected for power, water, air, and communications. Large cargo is moved through vacuum using service vehicles and automatic systems.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Type 2:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ships are actually brought into an enclosed docking area that is pressurized. Cargo and personnel move through pressurized areas for all activities. This is an expensive option, since it requires high maintenance station facilities. It is used primarily on Spun stations and for cargo that cannot be exposed to high vacuum conditions.</p>
