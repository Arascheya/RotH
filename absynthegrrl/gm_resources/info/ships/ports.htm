<p class="regtxt5">Space stations are like cities - a cross section of many different levels of socio-economic class. Large trade areas are usually located near the docking facilities to provide convenience to arriving passengers. The more expensive and nicer areas are near the docks reserved be the corporate carriers. The facilities near the public access docks are more run down and cater to a much less well to do crowd. There is a constant mix of different appearances, attitudes and social levels wandering about any section of a station at any given time. Constant activity is the norm on larger facilities that run 3 full shifts all the time. Smaller stations will have fewer shifts and more limitations on available goods and services.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shopping and social areas near docking areas and other common points of the station. Always ebbing and flowing with the changing of various shifts going on duty and coming off. Also with the arrival and departure of ships, especially in the more travelled areas. Some stations have very few scheduled ship runs - these show the most intensive buildup of activity just before and during the ship’s time at station.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Large stations show a wide mix of various races. Smaller stations tend to be less mixed, more often reflecting the dominant race mix of the nearest planet.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">These facilities should be as colorful and exotic as possible, especially the big ones. These are the places where many different races and cultures mix the most - kind of like airports and train stations in current time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are areas in every station where everyone eventually passes by - kind of the promenade concept of DS9 or the Zocalo of B5. Try to achieve the tensions and interplays DS9 missed and B5 achieved.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is a stratification in terms of class of facilities depending on where they are. Near the corporate docking facilities the surroundings are very nice, plush and of high class. Near the general docking facilities things are rougher, catering to the average small company and independent spacer who still desires social contact but doesn’t have a lot to spend on fancy things.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Cargo handling and passenger facilities are grouped fairly close together - mostly because stations are cramped for space.</p>
