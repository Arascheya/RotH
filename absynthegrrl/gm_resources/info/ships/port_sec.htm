<p class="regtxt5">Ships are responsible for their own security checks. Station security is more worried about dangers to the station. Customs requirements vary, but usually require a check of anything moving from one ship to another. Customs handles this by insisting on a customs inspection of all ships at time of arrival. Checks can be refused, but then cargo bays are sealed with transponders that will alert customs if there is any tampering. These seals must be removed before departure or cost of replacement is added to docking fees. These devices are rigged with complex self destruct systems to prevent reverse engineering.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Arriving personnel are automatically scanned for weapons at the station end of the access tubes. Each station has its own list of prohibited weapons. This information is transmitted as part of the arrival briefing data transmitted to inbound ships. Most Core Systems require ident checks on arrival. This is handled at the station end of the access tubes. Fringe Worlds are often more lax, only checking ident cards for station services or for access to certain areas. Identity checking policies are at the discretion of the station commander. Stations closer to the Core Systems are more likely to have higher ident requirements. The notable exception is when a ship originates from Centralys, then it is assumed stringent checks were performed there. Ships originating from Centralys are given only cursory checks.</p>
