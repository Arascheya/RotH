<p class="pagecaption">Artificial Gravity</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Artificial gravity was a spin-off of hyperdrive technology. It requires large amounts of power and requires a rather large equipment package. At this point the smallest grav-null package is a platform 10 square meters by 1 meter thick. It requires a level one <a href="frpower.htm">fusion package</a> to power it. The fusion package is in a 3 meter by 3 meter blister located somewhere on the platform.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Grav-null has greatly improved the ease of surface to space transportation. Now the reaction control systems only need to overcome object inertia. The power consumption is now split between a fusion reaction system and the standard propulsion system.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Grav-null rapidly mutated into grav-repulsion. Repulsion technology requires hideous amounts of energy and is not as safe as null technology. The field intensities required to provide the repulsion are very hard to shield from and are extremely hazardous to biological organisms. Therefore it is used mostly for freight. Special cargo ships have been designed around this technology and are just now coming into prevalence. They are still far more expensive than null technology shuttles, so only the richest planets and corporations are using them. It has the promise of revolutionizing surface to space transportation if the safety issues can be resolved.</p>
