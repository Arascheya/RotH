<p class="regtxt5">PERSONAL SURVIVAL KITS</p>

<p class="regtxt5">1. Many methods of carrying personal survival kits may be employed. These methods will of course be based on your requirements, individual needs and space in the aircraft. Carrying personal survival kits may pose minor problems, such as filling your flight clothing pockets prior to each flight. These problems should not, however, overshadow the advantages of having such items should the actual need arise.</p>


<p class="regtxt9">a. Items may be scattered throughout your flight clothing. This method is effective in that bulk and weight are not a problem. Also the loss of one item doesn't necessarily mean the loss of the entire kit.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">b. Individual kits may be packed using small plastic containers, soap dishes, or tobacco tins. Each kit could include like items such as a medical kit, fishing kit, or one kit could be packed to include general survival items.</p>
