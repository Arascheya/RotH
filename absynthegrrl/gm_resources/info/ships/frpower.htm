<p class="pagecaption">Fusion Reaction Power Packages</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Fusion reaction systems (FRS) were an off-shoot from the original hyperdrive systems. Tremendous amounts of power are required for entry into and return from hyperspace. Fusion systems were the first systems capable of providing that level of power.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A fusion reaction system consists of several components. There is the main cell, a fuel system, and a power conditioning unit. The main cell contains the reaction vessel and containment system, the power transducer, and a spent fuel containment unit. Containment is a triple redundant system with emergency cut-off. Cut-off stops all fuel flow and skews the compression fields enough that reaction core coherence fails, resulting in fragmenting of the reaction mass. This effectively stops the reaction. Waste heat is then dumped as rapidly as possible to prevent re-ignition.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The fuel system is a hydrogen gas container and regulator. The external power conditioner converts the output energy into the correct types for the application. In its simplest form it is a connection block for attaching external equipment.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Spent fuel periodically needs venting. This needs to be done at a facility set up to handle radio-active waste. Often these are special stations located away from major population planets. Waste fuel is usually gathered and fired into a nearby star for disposal.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Fusion reaction systems come in various sizes. The smallest sizes, Level 1 and Level 2, require external power for start-up. Most fusion systems are started and left operational until they require major servicing. In the "idle" mode they require minimal fuel flow.</p>
