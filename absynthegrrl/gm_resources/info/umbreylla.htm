<p class="pagecaption">Um Brey Lla Alchemy</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This City of Doors alchemist promises unguents, potions, and regeneratives to the well to do. They provide various life extension, health and damage reducers, and various other patent potions of varying degrees of efficacy. Their symbol is a red and yellowed umbrella top.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A lower grade Umbrella Corp chemist stumbled through a Door into Centrys and set up shop. The goods were poor and useless until a wandering alchemist joined her. Um Brey Lla is now run by the sixth generation descendants of those two. It has grown into a thriving business.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They have diversified, teaming up with the <a href="freetrade.htm">Free Trade Alliance</a> to move various goods. They now handle exotic foods, beverages, and other exotic biological based items as well as their core alchemical business. It is believed by the paranoid that they have returned to some of their core concepts of engineering life products using alchemical and technological means.</p>
