<p class="pagecaption">Cyber Wars</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Cyber Wars were fought mostly in 3078. The roots of the final conflict were sown during the years leading up to 3078. The final trigger event came in the failure of the <a href="jaranthus.htm">Jaranthus Experiments</a>. Religious fanatics and others who had argued that it was wrong for flesh to merge with machine used the failure as a springboard to launch their agenda into the mainstream. In 3078 it exploded into wide-spread violence.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The crowning achievement of the Wars was the complete destruction of the <a href="psytech.htm">PsyberTech Systems</a> facilities on Infoterra 8. By the end of the conflict there were no survivors on that world and it was rendered inhospitable for re-colonization. With the destruction of <a href="psytech.htm">PsyberTech Systems</a> the evolving implant technology was ended. Bio engineering groups rose to fill the void and medical technology veered away from mechanical solutions into genetic modifications and biochemical solutions.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">More peaceful factions of the anti-cyberware groups forced through laws making any man-machine direct interface illegal.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Given the erratic results <a href="psytech.htm">PsyberTech Systems</a> had been having trying to re-create the tech from the <a href="losthome.htm">lost homeworld</a> it might not have been the worst event for it to end.</p>
