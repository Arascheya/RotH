<p class="pagecaption">The Difference between Paganism, Wicca & Witchcraft</p>

<p class="regtxt5">(I have made a few edits to this post to clarify a few things and address some of the feedback received).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There seems to be much confusion in our society about the difference between pagans, witches and wiccans, so I am going to try to explain it in simple terms, both to clarify it for those new to their path, and for Christians and other non pagans in the hope that this will help people to understand us better.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a common misconception that all Pagans are witches, and/or that all Pagans are Wiccans. This is not true. Not all Pagans are witches, and not all Pagans are Wiccans. Not all witches are pagans either, but all wiccans are pagans, as wicca falls under the paganism umbrella.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Let’s start with Pagans.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Paganism is an umbrella term used to encompass many different religions (in fact, most non Christian based religions fall under the paganism umbrella).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Pagans are usually followers of religions that have been influenced by ancient Earth-based religions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Notice that it is religions with an “s”, not “religion”. This is because there are many, many, MANY different religions that fit the term ‘pagan’.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It means that you can be, for example, a Pagan Wiccan, A Pagan Witch, A Pagan Druid, a Pagan Shaman, or a mixture of all those things and more!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some people only consider the Earth-based religions of Europe to be Pagan; some include the religions of Africa and still others include the religions of the Far East, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, as well as that of Native Americans, Aborigines and other indigenous tribes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A person who considers themselves a Pagan, is usually polytheistic. (Though not always). Polytheistic means one believes in more than one deity, whether that is a god or a goddess, both or many gods & goddesses. A pantheon is a group of gods corresponding to a particular country. There is a Roman pantheon, Greek pantheon, Norse pantheon, Celtic pantheon, Native American pantheons etc. These are just a few examples. There are many more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now let's move on to Wicca.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Wicca is a type of Paganism based on the worship of Nature as deity, and the duality of deity, and it gathers its practices from Pre-Christian beliefs and practices.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Wicca as we know it today, is generally believed to have been created in the 1950s by Gerald Gardner, so it's a relatively new religion. (Although Gardner claimed to have been inititated into it by Dorothy Clutterbuck.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a debate as to whether this was actually true, and as I was not actually there at the time, I cannot really say for certain whether or not this was true. What I do believe however, is that Gardner based much of it on ancient practices and beliefs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Normally Wiccans tend to follow the Wiccan Rede, which is a set of guidelines based on the rules of Harm None, and the Law of Three (meaning everything you do comes back to you three times, it's basically a different version of karma). (Not all wiccans do follow these, mind you. Some still call themselves Wiccan and don’t follow these guidelines).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Wiccans generally believe in either both a god and goddess (duality), or just a God, or just the Goddess, or they may worship many different gods and/or pantheons.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something a lot of people misunderstand about Wicca is the use of magick. Magick is not a necessity for practicing Wicca. Instead it is a useful and awesome tool that you can decide to use or not. Some Wiccans may practice magick and some may just ignore that bit and stick to honouring the passing of seasons, cycles of the moon and sun, and Gods.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are several different types of Wicca. Here are a few to explore further on your own:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Gardnerian Tradition<br/>
Dianic Tradition<br/>
Caledonii Tradition<br/>
Celtic Wicca<br/>
British Tradition<br/>
Alexandria Tradition</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And of course there are Solitary Wiccans who practice by themselves, and Eclectic Wiccans that have no set Tradition and borrow from whatever they feel right.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So what about Witchcraft?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Witches are people that use magic to manipulate the energy of the world to achieve their goals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Witchcraft is not necessarily a religion so much as the use and knowledge of magick, and the world around you. You can be any religion you’d like (or none at all) and still be a Witch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">(Note: There are some who call themselves Christian witches, and of course Vodoo is a mixture of Catholicism and witchcraft. Some of these witches may believe in the devil and/or work with or against demonic entities, however that is a whole other kettle of fish, that you can research yourself if you're interested.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some witches belong to covens, but many are solitary witches, who practice witchcraft on their own.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some witches choose to follow the wiccan rede even though they are not technically wiccan, because they believe in the law of harming none, but many witches do not follow the wiccan rede at all, and some witches, such as grey witches, have no problem casting a curse or binding spell if they feel it necessary to protect themselves or their family.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are many kinds of witches, such as wild witches, hedge witches, kitchen witches, green witches, grey witches, eclectic witches and more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So let's review</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are some similarities in Paganism, Wicca and Witchcraft. For example, the symbol of neo- Paganism, Wicca & Witchcraft is the pentacle. The pentacle is a symbol for the five elements: fire, water, earth, air and spirit. (Many pagan religions do not use the pentacle as a symbol, and some have their own symbols that are not shared by Wicca or witchcraft).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Pagans, Wiccans and Witches generally do not believe in Satan, Lucifer, or the devil as he is often called in Christian religions. They believe that he is simply a Christian entity. It is generally believed that the Christian church created their devil based on the Horned Gods worshipped by pagans, to turn pagans away from their horned gods, but my point here is that most pagans, wiccans and witches don't believe in the Christian version of the devil. (Of course, Christian witches do, but that is a whole other story. You can do your own research if that interests you.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Paganism actually came years before Christianity. Wicca did not. Wicca is a relatively new religion. Witchcraft has been around for thousands of years. Witches were the healers, midwifes and oracles of their village.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The term "Pagan" actually means "country dweller".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In Wicca, some believe in just a God, some believe in just a Goddess, and some believe in both. There are even some who believe in a number of gods and/or goddesses.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In witchcraft, witches may believe in a god, a goddess, both, many gods, or none at all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Paganism and witchcraft do not have a founder. Wicca as we know it today does. The founder of Wicca is Gerald Gardner.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are many Sabbats and Esbats that are celebrated in modern paganism, Wicca and witchcraft.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some people believe that these holidays are only celebrated in Wicca but this is inaccurate. These holidays, Sabbats, and Esbats are also recognized by some pagan religions and are usually celebrated by most modern pagans, wiccans and witches. (Though not by all pagan religions - eg. Hindus, Buddhists, and many other pagan religions do not necessarily celebrate the Sabbats & Esbats. But many do, for example some followers of neo-paganism.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In Paganism, you do not have to practice witchcraft or magick.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In Wicca, witchcraft is usually, though not always, practiced.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In Witchcraft, magick is practiced, but you can be any religion or none at all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are both male and female pagans, wiccans and witches. Male witches are called witches, NOT wizards, sorcerers or warlocks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You do not have to be scared of witches, wiccans or pagans. We do not worship the devil, sacrifice babies, drink blood, or hold demonic rituals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We are not perfect, we are just human, like you. We have jobs, we love our families, we care for our friends. We are your neighbours, doctors, waitresses, nurses, and more. We are all around you, but most of the time you will never know we are witches or pagans. Of course, there may be some witches who do bad things. There is good and bad in every group of people, including Christians. But most of us are just like you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is so much more I could go into, but I think I have covered the most important points. If you would like to know more about paganism, Wicca or witchcraft, I encourage you to do a Google search and read as many definitions as you can, in order to get a really good understanding.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So there you go. I hope that this information helps to clarify things for you, and maybe breaks down some misconceptions about us.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Of course, not everybody will agree with these definitions, and that's fine. The best thing about these paths is that there is no real right or wrong way to practice them. And there are always going to be exceptions to every rule, so to speak. But this post is intended to be a very basic overview and perhaps first stepping stone in your understanding.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I always encourage people to do their own research, read as many books, websites and resources as you can, and follow what feels like truth in your own heart. Don't ever just take it for granted that what any writer says is gospel, or the only truth. (Including what I have written. smile emoticon )</p>
