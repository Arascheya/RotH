<p class="sectioncaption">General Story Ideas</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Egypt - or alt. Egypt</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Story told to someone about a person they knew who was transported to ancient egypt thru a gate at one of the older temples. He is mistaken for the god ra and help almost captive by the priests, all in the desire to properly revere him. From dropped comments he figures out the gate is operational on the solstices and equinoxes. After a bit of time he slips out and observes the state of the common people and decides to try and do something about it. He uses a few things from the 20th century to perform ‘miracles’ for the common people to get them behind him and rouse them against the priesthood. They throw them down and establish a different order before he steps back through the door two years after he first left. If actually use this need to look for a time of great change in egyptian history and fit this into it.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Gold of lightning tears the sky</p>

<p class="regtxt9">it falls upon the earth and enters.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Lightning flash and clap of thunder - </p>
<p class="regtxt9">Desire leaps from eye to eye,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Roars in the heart like thunder</p>
<p class="regtxt9">And hears in another heart its echo.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Desire strikes, sets thought afire.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">This love is lightning flash and thunder clap;</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Aisha! You are the echo in the valley.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Aisha! You are the benign rain.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">You alone can appease me,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">If Allah will permit.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt9">When God shared beauty out, there were ten received a portion.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Soap, henna, and silk made three.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">With the plough, flocks, and swarms of bees, they made six.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">The sun when he rises on the mountains was the seventh.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">The crescent moon, when she is slender as the christian’s dagger,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Horses, and books, brought the count to ten.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">What remained was all carried off by Muhammed, the Apostle.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt9">Beauty - God divided it. Three carried it off.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">One portion, the sun when he rises on the mountains;</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Another, the moon when she rises on the mountains;</p>
<p class="regtxt9">The third portion - who carried it off?</p>
<p class="regtxt9">But little Ruqiya, the queen of maidens.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">He who has beauty, knowledge, and a fine horse</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Can think he’s reached heaven without passing through the tomb.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt9">When the guardian of the flock dies, who weeps?</p>
<p class="regtxt9">None but the little kid he helped a hundred times.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Will ride on the waves again if it be set upright.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Everything in the world has a doctor to set it to rights -</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Only for Love and for Death there is no remedy.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Berber songs</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Until the day when the crow turns white -</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Until we hear men saying, "The salt marsh lies fallow</p>
<p class="regtxt9">And they are gathering honey from the oleander" -</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Until the day the acacia grows  without thorns,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">And the serpent is without venom -</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Until the canon balls or the powder that flames</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Have lost their power to harm - </p>
<p class="regtxt9">Until that day, my love, I shall not leave you.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt9">See our virgins pour out water...</p>
<p class="regtxt9">virgin water calls forth virgin water, for the recovery of our spring.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">what would the social structure evolve as?</p>
