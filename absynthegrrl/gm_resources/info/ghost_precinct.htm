<p class="pagecaption">Section 13 (Ghost Precinct)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Ghost Precinct operates out of 1 Police Plaza and is tasked with investigating anything Veil related. The precinct doesn't officially exist, and the police commisioner and all other officials will deny it if asked. Unofficially, the precinct is called in as soon as a Veil Event is identified. All police carry an identification amulet, that will alert them to Veil Events. Basic police academy training covers this phase of Veil Events. Officers transferring or recruited into the Ghost Precinct receive Veil related training at that time. Secrecy is maintained, however, given the extent of Veil activity in Yew Nork, leaks are inevitable. The Ghost Precinct and police communications officers rely on willing disbelief and skepticism to help down-play any leaked data. So far, this has worked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If this group is referred to at all, they are called Section 13, an administrative division, handling affairs around particularly brutal murders. The visible offices actually do what the charter implies. Offices in the back handle the Ghost Precint business.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Staff:<br/>
Lance Dominic - Captain of precint<br/>
Senior Detective Nikki Bishop - in charge of the investigation arm<br/>
Phil Asserra - pathologist<br/>
Nadjah Polina - forensic tech<br/>
Rick Mathers - lead tracker
