<p class="regtxt5">No one knows much about these beings and whether or not they actually existed. If they did, they are credited with creating several of the proto-races, the older ones, such as the <a href="drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a> and the <a href="irdisi.htm">Irdisinthyish</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All major religions deny the existence of any type of living beings as "creators". Any supposed evidence is destroyed and the finders killed. <a href="../npcs/v_cantrazel.htm">Valerie Cantrazel</a>, in the time of <a href="../npcs/valen.htm">Valen</a>, found conclusive evidence of a Creation Team bio-mechanical ship in the ice of <a href="../places/karanal/icicle.htm">Icicle</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Legends from various places claim one of the ships still drifts in the far reaches of the void. None of the legends indicate if it is a derelict, under command, or has been appropriated by other groups.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* for dev think of a cross between Moya and Spelljammer */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* determine what Valerie found in the depths of Icicle and how the proof was conclusive */</p>
