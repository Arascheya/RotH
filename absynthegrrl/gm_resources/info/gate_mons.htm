<p class="pagecaption">Monitors - The Heirarchy of the Damned</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Monitors watch over the <a href="gateinfo.htm">Gates</a> on various worlds. They are under the guidance of the Asylum Security Team. Each Realm will have an Awakened,usually from the Asylyum, presiding over a team of local beings. These groups seal and maintain the World and Hell Gates of the Realm. Their primary purpose is to reduce incursions by dangerous Awakened into Realms that have no way to cope with things outside their Realm. On Awakened Realms, they provide Gate maintenance and repair functions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the Realm of the Evacuees, they are called The Heirarchy of the Damned by their opponents. These opponents, the <a href="gladiusdei.htm">Gladius Dei</a>, are religious fanatics that have no understanding of Gates and Realms. They see anything originating from outside their Realm as evil and deserving of extermination.</p>
