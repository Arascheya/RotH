<p class="pagecaption">Steak and Kidney Pie</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1 lb. beef round steak<br/>
1 beef kidney<br/>
1/4 c. flour<br/>
1 tsp. salt<br/>
1/8 tsp. pepper<br/>
3 tbsp. lard or drippings<br/>
1 med. sized onion, chopped<br/>
1/4 c. chopped pimento<br/>
2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce<br/>
1/4 tsp. thyme<br/>
1/2 c. water<br/>
1 cup Skull and Bones Imperial Stout<br/>
Pastry for 1 crust pie</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Directions:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Cut round steak in 3/4 to 1 inch cubes. Remove tubes and fat from kidney and cut in 3/4 to 1 inch cubes. Combine flour, salt and pepper. Dredge steak and kidney cubes in seasoned flour (reserving any extra flour) and brown in lard or drippings. Remove meat from frying pan. Add onion to drippings and cook over low heat until transparent. Pour off drippings, add pimento, Worcestershire sauce, thyme and water to onion in frying pan and bring to boil. Stir in browned meat cubes, stout, and any remaining seasoned flour.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Invert 9 inch pie plate over pastry rolled to about 1/8 inch thickness. Cut a circle about an inch from rim of plate for top crust. Cut a design in crust to allow steam to escape.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Cut a second circle about 3/4 to 1 inch from edge of top crust to provide pastry to circle edge of pie plate. Moisten edge of plate and top with outer circle of pastry, adjusting to fit. Turn meat mixture into pie plate and cover with top crust. Seal top pastry to edge and flute. Bake in preheated 325 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours. Makes 6 servings.</p>
