<p class="pagecaption">BIGOS - The Polish Palate - try yourself</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Bigos is one of the most representative dishes of Polish cuisine. It is made of sweet cabbage and sauerkraut (after a controlled fermentation process), several kinds of smoked and raw meats, and specially selected ingredients-dried plums, wild mushrooms, juniper berries, peppercorns, onion and sour apples. This concoction is then seasoned with honey and red wine. Fast food fans beware-bigos needs no fewer than three days to reach full flavor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ingredients: 1 kg sweet (white) cabbage, 1 kg sauerkraut, 800 ml water, 500 g roast pork, 500 g roast beef, 600 g sausage (variety), 400 g boiled ham, 2 tablespoon lard, 10 dried boletus mushroom, 10 stoned prunes, 10 crushed juniper berries, 10 peppercorns, 1 bay leaf, 2 onions, 2 cooking apples, 150 ml dry red wine, 1 teaspoon honey, salt, pepper.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> 1. Drain the excess juices from the sauerkraut and chop it finally. Chop the cabbage, pour boiling water over it and drain. Rinse the mushrooms; cover with a little warm water and leave to soak for 15 minutes. Cook the mushrooms in their soaking liquid for 30 minutes, drain and cut into strips. Keep the mushroom stock.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> 2. Peel the apples and cut into cubes. Peel and wash the onions then lightly fry them in 1 tablespoon of lard.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> 3. Put the cabbage and sauerkraut into a large saucepan. Add onions, mushrooms stock, apples, prunes, juniper berries, bay leaf and pepper. Add 800 ml of boiling water, cover and cook over a low heat for 1 and 1 hour. Cut the meats into cubes. Slice the sausage and fry it lightly in lard. Add all to the pan. Pour the wine in, and honey and cook for a further 40 minutes. Stir frequently taking care not to burn it (roast duck or venison and roasting gravies can be added to bigos).</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> Serve hot with wholemeal bread (bigos can be reheated for several days. Its flavour improves as it matures tastes best on the third day).</p>
