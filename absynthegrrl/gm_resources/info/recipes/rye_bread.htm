<p class="pagecaption">Rye Flour Bread</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">2 cups milk<br/>
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast<br/>
2 tablespoons molasses<br/>
1 egg<br/>
7 1/2 cups rye flour, divided<br/>
1 tablespoon salt<br/>
2 tablespoons caraway seed</p>
<p class="regtxt9"></p>
<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Directions:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">1. Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Let cool until lukewarm.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">2. In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in the lukewarm milk. Let sit until creamy, about 10 minutes.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">3. Pour the yeast mixture into a large mixing bowl. Mix in the molasses, egg, 4 cups of the rye flour, salt, and caraway seeds. Cover with a damp towel, and let rise for 45 minutes.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">4. Stir in the remaining rye flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the mixture forms a soft dough; stir well after each addition. (You may not need to add all of the rye flour.)Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large mixing bowl, place the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth, and put in a warm place to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">5. Deflate the dough, and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces, and form into loaves. Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">6. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for about 30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Notes:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Vashi finds this recipe inferior to her mother's. Her mom would only use yak butter, smoked black tea, a bit of salt, and a tiny pinch of cardamom. She would double the amount of tea leaves shown in the Meriksas "gourmet" recipe.</p>
