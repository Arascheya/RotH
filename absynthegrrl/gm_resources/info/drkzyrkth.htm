<p class="pagecaption">Drkzyrkth</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Drkzyrkth were a race of experimenters and inventors. In the far past of the galaxy they were the contract developers for many other races. They would sell any technology to anyone for the right price. One of their experiments resulted in the <a href="../gods/razaks.htm">Razak Unity</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once the Drkzyrkth realized how out of control the <a href="../gods/razaks.htm">Razak Unity</a> had become they set about engineering a force of counter-weapons. First were war machines on a grand scale, able to withstand coordinated attacks and retaliate with enough firepower to stop squadrons. Then they moved on to more mobile warrior bionoids. These were a combination of high tech alloys, weapons, and processors, enhanced with biological brains and nervous systems for intuitive data processing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A seperate line of nanotech research was also begin to provide infiltration and data gathering capabilities. This was a variant of a data gathering probe nanite that was already under development. This nanite escaped from the research facility and ripped through the <a href="../places/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth world</a>. In the end, it left no survivors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The warrior bionoids were in advanced testing stages at the time of the death of the world. Scattered pockets of these can be found on long dead worlds. One cache was discovered in a crashed transport ship in the early days of expansion from the lost homeworld, Karanal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Use Vorlon font for their runes, use english syntax and words. Will need to place a rosetta stone somewhere if the players are to figure this one out.</p>
