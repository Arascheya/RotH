<p class="pagecaption">Grainne Ni Mhaille Holdings</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Grainne Ni Mhaille Holdingsis named after a long lost relative of Thomas O'Malley. This company owns four sections of land in downtown Cagocha. Tom has trusted managers handling property management for the holdings. He is quite rich from the value of the assetts plus the income they generate. Irena has no idea until she signs the paperwork for transfer and is briefed by the managers and legal team. See GEarth locations for where the properties are.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Waverly's Pub and O'Malley's Pub are also owned by this company.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena becomes sole owner through a transfer from Tom. Tom sipulates he be allowed to retain half the income for the rest of his life and be allowed to remain in his current home. Irena easily agrees. The transfer is overseen by Rani Corp legal team to reduce tax load and legal hassles.</p>
