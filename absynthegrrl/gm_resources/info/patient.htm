<p class="pagecaption">Patient Revolt</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This was a wide-spread backlash against the medical, drug, and insurance systems of the last century. Patients demanded massive changes in medical oversight and procedures to remove the drug companies and insurance groups from the medical decision process. In theory it was a great idea. In practice the spate of lawsuits and conflicting legislations by various nation-states crashed the world medical system. In the after-math Mega-Corp hospitals and drug compnies rose to fill the void. Medical care became even more expensive and selective.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Governments tried to step in at last with unified national health care systems but their programs were too little too late. In the current environment the Mega-Corps contract for health care for their personnel. Everyone else is left to fend for themselves. Black market doctors, clinics, and other facilities provide care that ranges from adequate to completely incompetent.</p>
