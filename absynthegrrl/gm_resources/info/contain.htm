<p class="pagecaption">Razak Containment</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Razak Containment is actually known only to the highest levels of the military and Valen. She wasn’t really supposed to know - if the military could have kept it from her they would have. In the alliance days it was a well kept secret and buried in budget requests in ways that wouldn’t draw suspicion.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Anyone assigned to the containment was effectively removed from any other possibilities - the idea was to send single people there and then any promotions or transfers would be within the containment command units. There were several reports of dissatisfied recruits attempting to return and being killed. The official reports listed all deaths as accidents in the line of duty and the families were compensated accordingly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen’s assistant stumbled across mentions of the Razak zone when he was looking for something else.</p>
