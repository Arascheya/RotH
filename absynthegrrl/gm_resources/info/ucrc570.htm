<p class="regtxt5">RC 570 is a nano-tech data acquisition system being developed by Ronin DigiTronics. It is their hope that these nanobots can be implanted in biologicals and provide remote data gathering through them. So far it has been tested in lab animals under carefully designed conditions. It has performed well. Data is gathered by the nanobots clustered in various sections of the brain and then scanned out. The resulting data is interpreted by an AI system into probabilities of data. The next tests will be to see what results are achievable in human hosts.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Phase two is human trials. This requires additional programming for the AI and implanting several test subjects. These subjects will be scanned when entering or leaving the arcology. When possible external recording of data will occur simultaneously to allow better correlation of the data. Target probabilities are in the 85 to 95 percentile. Based on animal tests the researchers believe this can be achieved.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Phase three will include updated nanobots with the ability to administer various neurochemicals to reinforce desired behaviors in the targets. Ideally this could be used for industrial espionage and better control of corporate personnel.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Yasmine's mother is in charge of the project. She has a few misgivings about phase three, however not enough to want to end or modify the goals.</p>
