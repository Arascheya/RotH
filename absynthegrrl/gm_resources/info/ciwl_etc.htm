<p class="pagecaption">Internation Transportation Consortium</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Main Facilities <a href="../../../non_pub/a-victorianlondon/map1895/l/f19.htm">location</a> in G-20 on 1895 map.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During a visit to the United States in 1870 and inspired by the achievements of the Pullman brothers, <a href="../npcs/nagelmackers.htm">Georges Nagelmackers</a> decides to create a luxury train system to rival the states version . He lacks sufficient funding to accomplish his goals and turns to his friends the Wellinghams. <a href="../npcs/lordwillem.htm">Willem Wellingham</a> convinces his father to fund this. The create International Transportation Consortium and launch their luxury service under its umbrella. Need a different catchy name than "Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits" (CIWL), which is in use in the real world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By 1884 CIWL becomes "Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits et des Grands Express Européens" and business is thriving. <a href="../npcs/lordwillem.htm">Lord Willem</a>'s agressive modernizations of the rail systems have made ITC and the CIWL sub-company the envy of the world. The CIWL reputation for service and quality continues to climb.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Using information from the <a href="../npcs/engineer_g.htm">chief engineer - game</a>(<a href="../npcs/engineer_v.htm">chief engineer - Valen</a>) and Nikola Tesla, poached from America in 1886, <a href="../npcs/lordwillem.htm">Lord Willem</a> believes he can produce electrical generators capable of running the electric helper engines necessary to take the trains through the tubes of London. <a href="hyperdyne.htm">Hyperdyne Energy</a> is spun up as an ITC subsidiary to handle the development of electrical systems and power generation. They start out at Battersea, building a prototype core tap power plant there. As <a href="hyperdyne.htm">Hyperdyne Energy</a> grew and ITC needed to test tunnel technology, a proto-arcology was built on the Isle of Wight in 1890 and the main Hyperdyne development center was moved there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The stellar reputation of CIWL is rewarded in 1886 when they are awarded the organization of official journeys of the French Republic and most European Royal Courts. The Compagnie is renowned over the world by its golden logotype, the two lions holding the intertwined " WL ".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Through continued shrewd business acumen <a href="../npcs/lordwillem.htm">Lord Willem</a> consolidates his british holdings and buys out Georges Nagelmackers in 1892. He now has complete control over the majority of Euopean rail transportation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As a business diversification strategy <a href="../npcs/lordwillem.htm">Lord Willem</a> forms International Computing Machines in 1893 and Computational Solutions International in 1894. Both companies are wholy owned subsidiaries of ITC and are both formed to take advantage of the rapid growth of Difference Engine computing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Another current project - circa 1895 - is the channel tunnel. This builds on technologies developed for the tunnel to the Isle of Wight and the Core Tap power systems.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">ITC and <a href="hyperdyne.htm">Hyperdyne Energy</a> grow, they set a new direction for energy and transport. This alters the course of the world and, along with Willem's pleas to other industrialists, shifts the balance of power, reducing the effect of nation-states, setting the stage for the <a href="mega_ascend.htm">Mega-Corp Ascendency</a>, and preventing the two devastating world wars.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../npcs/lucywellingham.htm">Lucy Wellingham</a> and <a href="../npcs/minamurray.htm">Wilhelmina Murray</a> propose using binary arithmetic to make engine design and construction simpler. This would also allow more versatile programming approaches given the simplicity of binary operations. This could easily be used to link to elctrical equipment having On states and Off states, increasing the ease of adapting to industrial control.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* modern Europe has a rail consortium - Willem should weld together a European rail and corporate consortium in the 1890s, will reduce possibility of war */</p>
