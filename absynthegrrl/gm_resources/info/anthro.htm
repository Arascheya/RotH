<p class="pagecaption">Cultural Anthropology Concepts to Apply</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Low vs High Context culture</p>
<p class="regtxt9">In low context culture many personal beliefs and ideals are not shared by everyone in the cultural group. The United States is a good example of this. Backgrounds are varied, religious beliefs are varied, news resources, education, nd other basic data groups are different in various locations leaving the culture loosely coupled on many concepts.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">In a high context culture the information the average person swims in is very much the same throughout the cultural group. Japan is an example of this. News, education, and other social data is the same from area to area producing a much higher concentration of shared cultural context.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Context sharing levels directly effect communication in terms of shared basis of ideas. In a high context culture a lot more can go unsaid because the base knowledge level between members is much higher.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Founding Principles</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Shared religious heritage - whether or not it still strongly adhered to. Religion tends to infiltrate to the very depths of a culture. Even if the culture no longer strictly adheres to the religion(s) it started with the influence of that thought remains a cultural force long after. It colors the thought processes and constructs as well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Other cultural items would be things like valuing harmony over truth. The driving ethos of a culture.</p>
