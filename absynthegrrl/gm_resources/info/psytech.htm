<p class="regtxt5">PsyberTech developed custom implantable cyberware for military applications. They were the leaders in stealth components and infantry augmentation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Cyberware was just begining to become a viable body modification when Valen was in college. Several spectacular failures of military cyberware research had the general populace concerned that this was not the best way to go for military or civilian enhancements.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">PsyTech was destroyed in the <a href="cyberwars.htm">Cyber Wars</a>. The facilities were destroyed and most of the personnel were killed. It was rumored that an off-site backup facility held copies of the research data and findings but it was never found.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The medical and cyberware research teams were headed by Samantha and Artemus Draybin.</p>
