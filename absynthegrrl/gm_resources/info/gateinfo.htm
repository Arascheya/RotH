<p class="sectioncaption">Tesch Mar Thesis Brief</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Gates</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gates can form on any world. They come into being where the boundary between "Real Space" (an Ancient term for the Prime Material Plane) and the "Gate Dimension" are thin. Through my researches I intend to determine the usual number and placement strategy of these gates.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Further I hope to prove these gates are actually linked to local magical nodes (called Earth Nodes in some papers) in some way. I plan to prove these gate nodes are actually super nodes in the earth node network. As such mathematical analysis indicates there should be seven super nodes for each local network in the Prime Material Plan. (mathematical modeling based on the Tesch Mar Hypothesis of Unified Universal Magic)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gates may be used to travel between places anywhere within the multi-verse. All that is required is the appropriate magic spells.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Kaltereth</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">A Corollary to Tesch Mar’s Thesis on Gates</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Many years later Kaltereth devised a more complete theory using ideas proposed in (need another majik tome name). Kaltereth proposed that the nodes weren't connected in a random manner as Tesch Mar’s papers indicate, but rather were arranged in tree structures. Each tree would have a base node that tied to other base nodes in a ring/star type of topography. Her conclusions up to the point of her disappearance stated there were seven base or super nodes from which the tree structures originate. She postulated even more intense effects on magic at these super nodes. She based these conclusions on careful measurements of magic travel times compared with actual map distances for several nodes she found. She found travel times tended to imply the path between nodes was not always the straightest of lines. Up until her disappearance she was trying to devise a way to identify and travel to one of these super nodes. She also believed these nodes were in actuality the fabled World Gates, mentioned in non-human legends as their points of origin in this world.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Actual Design</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On worlds where the boundaries between "Real Space" and the "Gate Dimension" are thin any sort of intense energy burst can bring a gate into being. These gates form because of a tear in the boundary between dimensions. Harmonics from these pulses can open gates into many different dimension sets. This is one way Hell Gates can come into being at the same time. World Gates can be created with carefully contained magic or technology and thus not cause harmonic gates to form.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a more sinister way to create hell gates. This requires the willing sacrifice of a powerful Arcane. Six other sacrifices are also required. First a gate framework is created. Next a special crystal is placed in the horns of the <a href="..\items\souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a> and it is used in the preparation rituals. During these rituals the other six are sacrificed one at a time and their energies forced into the crystal through the use of the Soul Eater. Once these sacrifices have been made the crystal is removed from the blade and attuned by the target Arcane. The crystal is then implanted in the forehead of the Arcane sacrifice and he is bound to it through a ritualistic death. The six original sacrifices contribute Power, Con, and Intelligence to the resulting creature. During the rituals the essences of the sacrifices cook down into the crystal and bones of the Arcane. These bones are then placed into a gate framework and another series of rituals are performed  to create the Hell Gate. A final set of rituals bind the gate, creature, and gate framework into one. The spirit of the creature becomes the gate controller. Another part of it splits off and becomes a wraith-like being that guards the gate and controller.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bones of the Arcane are placed into the gate framework with the skull placed behind the key stone. The other bones are used to frame the opening.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hand has found additional magics that allow him to create binding and controlling spells when the gate is being created. This places the guardian under his control and allows him to use it as one of his minions. If the physical form of this creature is killed it will reform at its gate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To seal a Hell Gate requires a power vs power against the guardian/controller and several spells to create the actual seal itself. These include spells to place the guardian into a form of stasis so it cannot awaken and cast spells to remove the seal. A mythryl spike is also required. This is hollowed out and the void filled with anti-magic serum and driven into the skull behind the key stone of the gate. This also helps to keep the guardian from performing any magic to break the seal. A sealed Hell Gate cannot be re-opened somewhere else. It must first be closed and then re-opened with another series of sacrifices and rituals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Closing a Hell Gate is even more difficult. This requires the <a href="../monsters/gatekeeper.htm">Gate Keeper</a> spirit to be dispelled and then all the magics bound into the gate and framework to be unwoven. There are spells available from several groups that allow the sharing/combining of power to allow enough for a chance at the power vs power required to seal or close a gate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is another way to close a Hell Gate. This requires the use of Soul Eater. The Gate must first be prepared as if for Sealing. Once the mythryl spike has been driven home the Gate frame must be carefully taken down. Care must be taken to insure the spike remains in contact with the skull in the key stone at all times. After the skeleton is exposed then Soul Eater must be touched to the binding crystal and a Ritual of Release incanted. Soul Eater will then suck the soul from the binding crystal and consume it in the normal way. If this is done with a new binding crystal in place the Gate Keeper's attributes are available to power the greater Dark Spells.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Properties</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Travel through any form of the gating system will leave distortions in the organism. This is detectable after the fact. The residuals won't give much in terms of origin or destination, but will reveal gate travelers.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">World Gates open directly into the Gate Dimension, seen as a vast fog of shifting green and black foggy shadows. Travel requires either guides, luck, magic items, or someone sensitive to the dimension to travel easily to the desired destination. Hell Gates open into worm-like tunnels through the Gate Dimension. These are commonly known as the Demon Web, a series of "tunnels" that link various Hell Gates. The Demon Web does not require a guide, just a map of connections and junctions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gate Dimension creatures can pass through the "boundaries" of the Demon Web tunnels and move from one mode of transit to the other. Non-Gate Dimension creatures need to go around the Demon Web Tunnels when they encounter them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Demon Web access points have a seven sided figure at each junction point. Activating a particular point of the figure opens that particular Hell Gate on the target Realm. World Gates have exit points clustered near each other in the Gate Dimension, but not in quite as clear a formation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">World Gates and Hyperdrives create the equivalent of vapor trails across the ethereal - these are echoes of the transdimensional aspects of these travel mechanisms. A talented seeker can catch traces of these trails and track them to origins and destinations. The echoes fade quickly, so tracking must be done within hours of the original travel.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The danger with hell gates is if all of them are closed they can be relocated and reopened using additional opening rituals.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">need to tie the hell gates to the demon web concept - a variant of the world gate concept - all Hell Gates go to the demonic section of the outer planes</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Gates - Misc. Notes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* work out better details of how techno gates/dimensions and majikal plains and such tie together */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">ethereal to astral - passing through a gap doesn't always punt one out of current space - it will spit one out into a random place in the astral plain if certain majiks are in effect at the time of transition</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* develop this concept further */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* consider changing the names of the gate systems to Void Gates and Web Gates to more closely represent where each connects to. Also, Web Gates don't just go to hell dimensions and Void Gates don't just go to non-hell locations. */</p>
