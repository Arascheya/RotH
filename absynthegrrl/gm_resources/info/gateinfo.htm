<p class="sectioncaption">Tesch Mar Thesis Brief</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Gates</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gates can form on any world. They come into being where the boundary between "Real Space" (an Ancient term for the Prime Material Plane) and the "Gate Dimension" are thin. Through my researches I intend to determine the usual number and placement strategy of these gates.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Further I hope to prove these gates are actually linked to local magical nodes (called Earth Nodes in some papers) in some way. I plan to prove these gate nodes are actually super nodes in the earth node network. As such mathematical analysis indicates there should be seven super nodes for each local network in the Prime Material Plane. (mathematical modeling based on the Tesch Mar Hypothesis of Unified Universal Magic)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gates may be used to travel between places anywhere within the multi-verse. All that is required is the appropriate magic spells.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Kaltereth</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">A Corollary to Tesch Mar’s Thesis on Gates</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Many years later Kaltereth devised a more complete theory using ideas proposed in (need another majik tome name). Kaltereth proposed that the nodes weren't connected in a random manner as Tesch Mar’s papers indicate, but rather were arranged in tree structures. Each tree would have a base node that tied to other base nodes in a ring/star type of topography. Her conclusions up to the point of her disappearance stated there were seven base or super nodes from which the tree structures originate. She postulated even more intense effects on magic at these super nodes. She based these conclusions on careful measurements of magic travel times compared with actual map distances for several nodes she found. She found travel times implied the path between nodes was not always the straightest of lines. Up until her disappearance she was trying to devise a way to identify and travel to one of these super nodes. She also believed these nodes were in actuality the fabled World Gates, mentioned in non-human legends as their points of origin in this world.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Actual Design</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On worlds where the boundaries between "Real Space" and the "Gate Dimension" are thin any sort of intense energy burst can bring a gate into being. These gates form because of a tear in the boundary between dimensions. There are always seven gates formed when a tear occurs. They form at locations where magical energies easily concentrate. Energy lines radiate out from these primary sources and can be tapped for various uses.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tears can be created deliberately by use of magic or technology, by accident when high power magic or tech malfunctions, or by random multi-versal events.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tears can happen into any realm, including ones that contain highly dangerous things. <a href="../npcs/ishra.htm">Ishra</a> maintains a group of Seal Teams that are sent to secure or close gates into dangerous realms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">CLosing gates is a difficult task, requiring actions in the Gate Dimension and in the realm. Steps must be coordinated and performed in a specific order. Any group can close a gate if they have the right tools and information. The <a href="seal_teams.htm">Seal Teams</a> are the best equiped to handle this task.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Gate Travel</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Travel through the Gate Dimension is possible in several different ways.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gate control devices allow point ot point travel. They are encoded at the time of creation to link two locations. They will only allow travel between the two points. They can be single use, multiple use, or permanent, depending on how they are created. They can be used between two points in the same realm or between realms. They use Virtual Private Tunneling (VPT) connections for the duration of the travel. VPT increases safety and introduces a time distortion that makes the tunneling almost instantaneous. Travelers are in a form of stasis that prevents them from detecting the bits of time actually taken. The stasis also provides a protective bubble around the travelers to prevent injury during travel. There are a few very sensitive people who can detect the entry and exit interfaces passed durring travel.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hyperdrives, a technological approach to the Gate System, also use VPT for travel. The time distortion effect makes the travel much faster, however some time still passes. Travelers are aware of this time of transit. Hyperdrive travel is not as fast as Gate COntroller travel. Travelers are not placed in protective fields, so technological or magic protections are necessary.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hut Interface is a special version of gate control methodology. The VPT connection formed between the Hut and the realmit is attached to, remains in place until it is shut down. Travel between the Hut and the realm is instantaneous. Extremely sensitive people can detect the transitions between Hut, Gate Dimension, and Realm.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Gate Leak</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Energy always leaks into a realm that has gates in it, regardless of sealed state. The only way to end Gate Leakage is to close the gate system to that realm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It is possible to slip into a world using gate leak. This allows things to slip in even if a gate is being monitotred. Beings ca ride the leak to a point away from the actual gate and appear there. This requires either a very small entity or a lot of additional power behind the travel spell or item used.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ggate leak can be used to form a specialized portal instance which will help bring beings in through gates that have been sealed. Hell Gates are a specific example of Gate Leakage being used to power specialized portals on worlds with sealed gates.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Adding more instances of the specialized portals increases the concentration of leakage and means easier access for beings slipping in this way. Up to seven special portals can be created this way, one for each main gate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Strange Attractors can detect things coming in through gate leak. The more powerful the Strange, the better their detection ability.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Local Portals</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Local portals can be attached to the master gates through magic or technology, allowing controlled access to other realms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One sinister way to create attached portals requires the willing sacrifice of a powerful Arcane. Six other sacrifices are also required. First a portal framework is created. Next a special crystal is placed in the horns of the <a href="..\items\souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a> and it is used in the preparation rituals. During these rituals the other six are sacrificed one at a time and their energies forced into the crystal through the use of the Soul Eater. Once these sacrifices have been made the crystal is removed from the blade and attuned by the target Arcane. The crystal is then implanted in the forehead of the Arcane sacrifice and he is bound to it through a ritualistic death. The six original sacrifices contribute Power, Con, and Intelligence to the resulting creature. During the rituals the essences of the sacrifices cook down into the crystal and bones of the Arcane. These bones are then placed into a portal framework and another series of rituals are performed to create the Hell Gate. A final set of rituals bind the portal, creature, and gate framework into one. The spirit of the creature becomes the portal controller. Another part of it splits off and becomes a wraith-like being that guards the portal and controller.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bones of the Arcane are placed into the portal framework with the skull placed behind the key stone. The other bones are used to frame the opening.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hand has found additional magics that allow him to create binding and controlling spells when the portal is being created. This places the guardian under his control and allows him to use it as one of his minions. If the physical form of this creature is killed it will reform at its gate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To seal a Hell Gate requires a power vs power against the guardian/controller and several spells to create the actual seal itself. These include spells to place the guardian into a form of stasis so it cannot awaken and cast spells to remove the seal. A mythryl spike is also required. This is hollowed out and the void filled with anti-magic serum and driven into the skull behind the key stone of the gate. This also helps to keep the guardian from performing any magic to break the seal. A sealed Hell Gate cannot be re-opened somewhere else. It must first be closed and then re-opened with another series of sacrifices and rituals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Closing a Hell Gate is even more difficult. This requires the <a href="../monsters/gatekeeper.htm">Gate Keeper</a> spirit to be dispelled and then all the magics bound into the gate and framework to be unwoven. There are spells available from several groups that allow the sharing/combining of power to allow enough for a chance at the power vs power required to seal or close a gate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is another way to close a Hell Gate. This requires the use of Soul Eater. The Gate must first be prepared as if for Sealing. Once the mythryl spike has been driven home the Gate frame must be carefully taken down. Care must be taken to insure the spike remains in contact with the skull in the key stone at all times. After the skeleton is exposed then Soul Eater must be touched to the binding crystal and a Ritual of Release incanted. Soul Eater will then suck the soul from the binding crystal and consume it in the normal way. If this is done with a new binding crystal in place the Gate Keeper's attributes are available to power the greater Dark Spells.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Properties</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Travel through any form of the gating system will leave distortions in the organism. This is detectable after the fact. The residuals won't give much in terms of origin or destination, but will reveal gate travelers.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">World Gates open directly into the Gate Dimension, seen as a vast fog of shifting green and black foggy shadows. Travel requires either guides, luck, magic items, or someone sensitive to the dimension to travel easily to the desired destination. Portals are linked to a specific target location when they are created. Portals are the prefered method of travel, since destinations are predictable. Hell Gates, being protals, are linked to a specific target location, set at the time of creation.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Older information</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These were early thoughts on the way things worked</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Demon Web access points have a seven sided figure at each junction point. Activating a particular point of the figure opens that particular Hell Gate on the target Realm. World Gates have exit points clustered near each other in the Gate Dimension, but not in quite as clear a formation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">World Gates and Hyperdrives create the equivalent of vapor trails across the ethereal - these are echoes of the transdimensional aspects of these travel mechanisms. A talented seeker can catch traces of these trails and track them to origins and destinations. The echoes fade quickly, so tracking must be done within hours of the original travel.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The danger with hell gates is if all of them are closed they can be relocated and reopened using additional opening rituals.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">need to tie the hell gates to the demon web concept - a variant of the world gate concept - all Hell Gates go to the demonic section of the outer planes</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Gates - Misc. Notes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* work out better details of how techno gates/dimensions and majikal plains and such tie together */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">ethereal to astral - passing through a gap doesn't always punt one out of current space - it will spit one out into a random place in the astral plain if certain majiks are in effect at the time of transition</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* develop this concept further */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* consider changing the names of the gate systems to Void Gates and Web Gates to more closely represent where each connects to. Also, Web Gates don't just go to hell dimensions and Void Gates don't just go to non-hell locations. */</p>
