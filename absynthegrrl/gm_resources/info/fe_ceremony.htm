I swear to protect the planet of Zeltrop and to continue healing the damage from the Last War.

<p class="regtxt5">I, Eltaryn, take this office and it’s responsibilities until I retire and turn them over to another or until I die.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Second Part</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The old First Elder or the Acting First Elder takes the candidate down to the Thought Crystal Gardens where he tells the person, "This ring is key to all knowledge and power of our world.  It will open all doors and areas to you."  At this time ring is placed on finger and person goes through attunement procedures.  After the new First Elder is attuned the old First Elder has him go to the center of the room and bend down, pressing ring into indentation in floor.  The floor opens into a room containing inscriptions on the walls telling of past history.  Also contains brainscan unit and computer terminal.</p>
