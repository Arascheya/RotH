<p class="regtxt5">And it shall come to pass that when the world is once again in dire peril from the manifestations of the evil presence, Ertan shall bring forth priestesses, blessed by Him, to lead the faithful.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">These priestesses shall have the mark of Ertan upon them. They shall lead the faithful to the lost artifacts of power and purity.  The priestesses shall then take the holy artifacts of Ertan and purify the faithful for the coming battle for the evil presence shall not be defeated without these blessed relics.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ertan shall cause the lost artifacts to be available to this world once again and he shall reveal their places of repose unto the faithful. The Vessel and the Bowl shall be found together but the Orbs have been scattered by the winds of fate and the twists of time.  Many and varied are the places of the Orbs and the Quest of Orbs shall be a long and torturous test of the worthiness of the faithful. Yet completed must it be for the evil presence to once more be defeated and contained. Beware for the evil worshippers seek their own lost artifacts and wary must be the faithful lest they be seduced by the evil ones. The Quest of Orbs must be led by a true priestess of Ertan, sanctified by His Mark, lest the Quest stumble and fall.  Only a true priestess shall reliably recognize the blessed Orbs of Law.</p>
