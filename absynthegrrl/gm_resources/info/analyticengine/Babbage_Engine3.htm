<P>Those labours which belong to the various branches of the mathematical
sciences, although on first consideration they seem to be the exclusive province
of intellect, may, nevertheless, be divided into two distinct sections; one of
which may be called the mechanical, because it is subjected to precise and
invariable laws, that are capable of being expressed by means of the operations
of matter; while the other, demanding the intervention of reasoning, belongs
more specially to the domain of the understanding. This admitted, we may propose
to execute, by means of machinery, the mechanical branch of these labours,
reserving for pure intellect that which depends on the reasoning faculties. Thus
the rigid exactness of those laws which regulate numerical calculations must
frequently have suggested the employment of material instruments, either for
executing the whole of such calculations or for abridging them; and thence have
arisen several inventions having this object in view, but which have in general
but partially attained it. For instance, the much-admired <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/pascal.html">machine of Pascal</A> is now
simply an object of curiosity, which, whilst it displays the powerful intellect
of its inventor, is yet of little utility in itself. Its powers extended no
further than the execution of the <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note1" name=BKnote1>first
four</A> operations of arithmetic, and indeed were in reality confined to that
of the first two, since multiplication and division were the result of a series
of additions and subtractions. The chief drawback hitherto on most of such
machines is, that they require the continual intervention of a human agent to
regulate their movements, and thence arises a source of errors; so that, if
their use has not become general for large numerical calculations, it is because
they have not in fact resolved the double problem which the question presents,
that of <EM>correctness</EM> in the results, united with <EM>economy</EM> of
time.
<P>Struck with similar reflections, Mr. Babbage has devoted some years to the
realization of a gigantic idea. He proposed to himself nothing less than the
construction of a machine capable of executing not merely arithmetical
calculations, but even all those of analysis, if their laws are known. The
imagination is at first astounded at the idea of such an undertaking; but the
more calm reflection we bestow on it, the less impossible does success appear,
and it is felt that it may depend on the discovery of some principle so general,
that, if applied to machinery, the latter may be capable of mechanically
translating the operations which may be indicated to it by algebraical notation.
The illustrious inventor having been kind enough to communicate to me some of
his views on this subject during a visit he made at Turin, I have, with his
approbation, thrown together the impressions they have left on my mind. But the
reader must not expect to find a description of Mr. Babbage's engine; the
comprehension of this would entail studies of much length; and I shall endeavour
merely to give an insight into the end proposed, and to develop the principles
on which its attainment depends.
<P>I must first premise that this engine is entirely different from that of
which there is a notice in the `Treatise on the Economy of Machinery,' by the
same author. But as the latter <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note2" name=BKnote2>gave
rise</A> to the idea of the engine in question, I consider it will be a useful
preliminary briefly to recall what were Mr. Babbage's first essays, and also the
circumstances in which they originated.
<P>It is well known that the French government, wishing to promote the extension
of the decimal system, had ordered the construction of logarithmical and
trigonometrical tables of enormous extent. M. de Prony, who had been entrusted
with the direction of this undertaking, divided it into three sections, to each
of which was appointed a special class of persons. In the first section the
formulæ were so combined as to render them subservient to the purposes of
numerical calculation; in the second, these same formulæ were calculated for
values of the variable, selected at certain successive distances; and under the
third section, comprising about eighty individuals, who were most of them only
acquainted with the first two rules of arithmetic, the values which were
intermediate to those calculated by the second section were interpolated by
means of simple additions and subtractions.
<P>An undertaking similar to that just mentioned having been entered upon in
England, Mr. Babbage conceived that the operations performed under the third
section might be executed by a machine; and this idea he realized by means of
mechanism, which has been in part put together, and to which the name Difference
Engine is applicable, on account of the principle upon which its construction is
founded. To give some notion of this, it will suffice to consider the series of
whole square numbers, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, &amp;c. By subtracting each
of these from the succeeding one, we obtain a new series, which we will name the
Series of First Differences, consisting of the numbers 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15,
&amp;c. On subtracting from each of these the preceding one, we obtain the
Second Differences, which are all constant and equal to 2. We may represent this
succession of operations, and their results, in the following table.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=297 src="images/menat1.gif"
width=345> </CENTER>
<P>From the mode in which the last two columns B and C have been formed, it is
easy to see, that if, for instance, we desire to pass from the number 5 to the
succeeding one 7, we must add to the former the constant difference 2;
similarly, if from the square number 9 we would pass to the following one 16, we
must add to the former the difference 7, which difference is in other words the
preceding difference 5, plus the constant difference 2; or again, which comes to
the same thing, to obtain 16 we have only to add together the three numbers 2,
5, 9, placed obliquely in the direction <EM>ab</EM>. Similarly, we obtain the
number 25 by summing up the three numbers placed in the oblique direction
<EM>dc</EM>: commencing by the addition 2+7, we have the first difference 9
consecutively to 7; adding 16 to the 9 we have the square 25. We see then that
the three numbers 2, 5, 9 being given, the whole series of successive square
numbers, and that of their first differences likewise may be obtained by means
of simple additions.
<P>Now, to conceive how these operations may be reproduced by a machine, suppose
the latter to have three dials, designated as A, B, C, on each of which are
traced, say a thousand divisions, by way of example, over which a needle shall
pass. The two dials, C, B, shall have in addition a registering hammer, which is
to give a number of strokes equal to that of the divisions indicated by the
needle. For each stroke of the registering hammer of the dial C, the needle B
shall advance one division; similarly, the needle A shall advance one division
for every stroke of the registering hammer of the dial B. Such is the general
disposition of the mechanism.
<P>This being understood, let us, at the beginning of the series of operations
we wish to execute, place the needle C on the division 2, the needle B on the
division 5, and the needle A on the division 9. Let us allow the hammer of the
dial C to strike; it will strike twice, and at the same time the needle B will
pass over two divisions. The latter will then indicate the number 7, which
succeeds the number 5 in the column of first differences. If we now permit the
hammer of the dial B to strike in its turn, it will strike seven times, during
which the needle A will advance seven divisions; these added to the nine already
marked by it will give the number 16, which is the square number consecutive to
9. If we now recommence these operations, beginning with the needle C, which is
always to be left on the division 2, we shall perceive that by repeating them
indefinitely, we may successively reproduce the series of whole square numbers
by means of a very simple mechanism.
<P>The theorem on which is based the construction of the machine we have just
been describing, is a particular case of the following more general theorem:
that if in any polynomial whatever, the highest power of whose variable is
<EM>m</EM>, this same variable be increased by equal degrees; the corresponding
values of the polynomial then calculated, and the first, second, third, &amp;c.
differences of these be taken (as for the preceding series of squares); the
<EM>m</EM>th differences will all be equal to each other. So that, in order to
reproduce the series of values of the polynomial by means of a machine analogous
to the one above described, it is sufficient that there be (<EM>m</EM>+1) dials,
having the mutual relations we have indicated. As the differences may be either
positive or negative, the machine will have a contrivance for either advancing
or retrograding each needle, according as the number to be algebraically added
may have the sign <EM>plus</EM> or <EM>minus</EM>.
<P>If from a polynomial we pass to a series having an infinite number of terms,
arranged according to the ascending powers of the variable, it would at first
appear, that in order to apply the machine to the calculation of the function
represented by such a series, the mechanism must include an infinite number of
dials, which would in fact render the thing impossible. But in many cases the
difficulty will disappear, if we observe that for a great number of functions
the series which represent them may be rendered convergent; so that, according
to the degree of approximation desired, we may limit ourselves to the
calculation of a certain number of terms of the series, neglecting the rest. By
this method the question is reduced to the primitive case of a finite
polynomial. It is thus that we can calculate the succession of the logarithms of
numbers. But since, in this particular instance, the terms which had been
originally neglected receive increments in a ratio so continually increasing for
equal increments of the variable, that the degree of approximation required
would ultimately be affected, it is necessary, at certain intervals, to
calculate the value of the function by different methods, and then respectively
to use the results thus obtained, as data whence to deduce, by means of the
machine, the other intermediate values. We see that the machine here performs
the office of the third section of calculators mentioned in describing the
tables computed by order of the French government, and that the end originally
proposed is thus fulfilled by it.
<P>Such is the nature of the first machine which Mr. Babbage conceived. We see
that its use is confined to cases where the numbers required are such as can be
obtained by means of simple additions or subtractions; that the machine is, so
to speak, merely the expression of <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteA">one particular
theorem</A> of analysis; and that, in short, its operations cannot be extended
so as to embrace the solution of an infinity of other questions included within
the domain of mathematical analysis. It was while contemplating the vast field
which yet remained to be traversed, that Mr. Babbage, renouncing his original
essays, conceived the plan of another system of mechanism whose operations
should themselves possess all the generality of algebraical notation, and which,
on this account, he denominates the <EM>Analytical Engine</EM>.
<P>Having now explained the state of the question, it is time for me to develop
the principle on which is based the construction of this latter machine. When
analysis is employed for the solution of any problem, there are usually two
classes of operations to execute: first, the numerical calculation of the
various coefficients; and secondly, their distribution in relation to the
quantities affected by them. If, for example, we have to obtain the product of
two binomials (<EM>a</EM>+<EM>bx</EM>) (<EM>m</EM>+<EM>nx</EM>), the result will
be represented by <EM>am</EM> + (<EM>an</EM> + <EM>bm</EM>) <EM>x</EM> +
<EM>bnx</EM>², in which expression we must first calculate <EM>am</EM>,
<EM>an</EM>, <EM>bm</EM>, <EM>bn</EM>; then take the sum of <EM>an</EM> +
<EM>bm</EM>; and lastly, respectively distribute the coefficients thus obtained
amongst the powers of the variable. In order to reproduce these operations by
means of a machine, the latter must therefore possess two distinct sets of
powers: first, that of executing numerical calculations; secondly, that of
rightly distributing the values so obtained.
<P>But if human intervention were necessary for directing each of these partial
operations, nothing would be gained under the heads of correctness and economy
of time; the machine must therefore have the additional requisite of executing
by itself all the successive operations required for the solution of a problem
proposed to it, when once the <EM>primitive numerical data</EM> for this same
problem have been introduced. Therefore, since, from the moment that the nature
of the calculation to be executed or of the problem to be resolved have been
indicated to it, the machine is, by its own intrinsic power, of itself to go
through all the intermediate operations which lead to the proposed result, it
must exclude all methods of trial and guess-work, and can only admit the <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note3"
name=BKnote3>direct processes of calculation.</A>
<P>It is necessarily thus; for the machine is not a thinking being, but simply
an automaton which acts according to the laws imposed upon it. This being
fundamental, one of the earliest researches its author had to undertake, was
that of finding means for effecting the division of one number by another
without using the method of guessing indicated by the usual rules of arithmetic.
The difficulties of effecting this combination were far from being among the
least; but upon it depended the success of every other. Under the impossibility
of my here explaining the process through which this end is attained, we must
limit ourselves to admitting that the first four operations of arithmetic, that
is addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, can be performed in a
direct manner through the intervention of the machine. <A name=notes1>This
granted,</A> the machine is thence capable of performing every species of
numerical calculation, for all such calculations ultimately resolve themselves
into the four operations we have just named. To conceive how the machine can now
go through its functions according to the laws laid down, we will begin by
giving an idea of the manner in which it materially represents numbers.
<P>Let us conceive a pile or vertical column consisting of an indefinite number
of circular discs, all pierced through their centres by a common axis, around
which each of them can take an independent rotatory movement. If round the edge
of each of these discs are written the ten figures which constitute our
numerical alphabet, we may then, by arranging a series of these figures in the
same vertical line, express in this manner any number whatever. It is sufficient
for this purpose that the first disc represent units, the second tens, the third
hundreds, and so on. When two numbers have been thus written on two distinct
columns, we may propose to combine them arithmetically with each other, and to
obtain the result on a third column. In general, if we have a <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#noteB">series of columns</A>
consisting of discs, which columns we will designate as V<SUB>0</SUB>,
V<SUB>1</SUB>, V<SUB>2</SUB>, V<SUB>3</SUB>, V<SUB>4</SUB>, &amp;c., we may
require, for instance, to divide the number written on the column V<SUB>1</SUB>
by that on the column V<SUB>4</SUB>, and to obtain the result on the column
V<SUB>7</SUB>. To effect this operation, we must impart to the machine two
distinct arrangements; through the first it is prepared for executing <EM>a
division</EM>, and through the second the columns it is to operate on are
indicated to it, and also the column on which the result is to be represented.
If this division is to be followed, for example, by the addition of two numbers
taken on other columns, the two original arrangements of the machine must be
simultaneously altered. If, on the contrary, a series of operations of the same
nature is to be gone through, then the first of the original arrangements will
remain, and the second alone must be altered Therefore, the arrangements that
may be communicated to the various parts of the machine may be distinguished
into two principal classes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>First, that relative to the <EM>Operations</EM>.<BR>Secondly, that
  relative to the <EM>Variables</EM>. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P></P>By this latter we mean that which indicates the columns to be operated
on. As for the operations themselves, they are executed by a special apparatus,
which is designated by the name of <EM>mill</EM>, and which itself contains a
certain number of columns, similar to those of the Variables. When two numbers
are to be combined together, the machine commences by effacing them from the
columns where they are written, that is, it places <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note4"
name=BKnote4><EM>zero</EM></A> on every disc of the two vertical lines on which
the numbers were represented; and it transfers the numbers to the mill. There,
the apparatus having been disposed suitably for the required operation, this
latter is effected, and, when completed, the result itself is transferred to the
column of Variables which shall have been indicated. Thus the mill is that
portion of the machine which works, and the columns of Variables constitute that
where the results are represented and arranged. After the preceding
explanations, we may perceive that all fractional and irrational results will be
represented in decimal fractions. Supposing each column to have forty discs,
this extension will be sufficient for all degrees of approximation generally
required.
<P><A name=menaref1>It will now be inquired</A> how the machine can of itself,
and without having recourse to the hand of man, assume the successive
dispositions suited to the operations. The solution of this problem has been
taken from <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#noteC">Jacquard's
apparatus</A>, used for the manufacture of brocaded stuffs, in the following
manner:--
<P>Two species of threads are usually distinguished in woven stuffs; one is the
<EM>warp</EM> or longitudinal thread, the other the <EM>woof</EM> or transverse
thread, which is conveyed by the instrument called the shuttle, and which
crosses the longitudinal thread or warp. When a brocaded stuff is required, it
is necessary in turn to prevent certain threads from crossing the woof, and this
according to a succession which is determined by the nature of the design that
is to be reproduced. Formerly this process was lengthy and difficult, and it was
requisite that the workman, by attending to the design which he was to copy,
should himself regulate the movements the threads were to take. Thence arose the
high price of this description of stuffs, especially if threads of various
colours entered into the fabric. To simplify this manufacture, Jacquard devised
the plan of connecting each group of threads that were to act together, with a
distinct lever belonging exclusively to that group. All these levers terminate
in rods, which are united together in one bundle, having usually the form of a
parallelopiped with a rectangular base. The rods are cylindrical, and are
separated from each other by small intervals. The process of raising the threads
is thus resolved into that of moving these various lever-arms in the requisite
order. To effect this, a rectangular sheet of pasteboard is taken, somewhat
larger in size than a section of the bundle of lever-arms. If this sheet be
applied to the base of the bundle, and an advancing motion be then communicated
to the pasteboard, this latter will move with it all the rods of the bundle, and
consequently the threads that are connected with each of them. But if the
pasteboard, instead of being plain, were pierced with holes corresponding to the
extremities of the levers which meet it, then, since each of the levers would
pass through the pasteboard during the motion of the latter, they would all
remain in their places. We thus see that it is easy so to determine the position
of the holes in the pasteboard, that, at any given moment, there shall be a
certain number of levers, and consequently of parcels of threads, raised, while
the rest remain where they were. Supposing this process is successively repeated
according to a law indicated by the pattern to be executed, we perceive that
this pattern may be reproduced on the stuff. For this purpose we need merely
compose a series of cards according to the law required, and arrange them in
suitable order one after the other; then, by causing them to pass over a
polygonal beam which is so connected as to turn a new face for every stroke of
the shuttle, which face shall then be impelled parallelly to itself against the
bundle of lever-arms, the operation of raising the threads will be regularly
performed. Thus we see that brocaded tissues may be manufactured with a
precision and rapidity formerly difficult to obtain.
<P><A name=notes2>Arrangements</A> analogous to those just described have been
introduced into the Analytical Engine. It contains two principal species of
cards: first, Operation cards, by means of which the parts of the machine are so
disposed as to execute any determinate series of operations, such as additions,
subtractions, multiplications, and divisions; secondly, cards of the Variables,
which indicate to the machine the columns on which the results are to be
represented. The cards, when put in motion, successively arrange the various
portions of the machine according to the nature of the processes that are to be
effected, and the machine at the same time executes these processes by means of
the various pieces of mechanism of which it is constituted.
<P><A name=menaref5>In order more perfectly</A> to conceive the thing, let us
select as an example the resolution of two equations of the first degree with
two unknown quantities. Let the following be the two equations, in which
<EM>x</EM> and <EM>y</EM> are the unknown quantities:--
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=63 src="images/menaeq1.gif"
width=175> </CENTER>
<P>We deduce <IMG align=absMiddle height=37
src="images/menaeq2.gif" width=122>, and for
<EM>y</EM> an analogous expression. Let us continue to represent by
V<SUB>0</SUB>, V<SUB>1</SUB>, V<SUB>2</SUB>, &amp;c. the different columns which
contain the numbers, and let us suppose that the first eight columns have been
chosen for expressing on them the numbers represented by <EM>m</EM>, <EM>n</EM>,
<EM>d</EM>, <EM>m</EM>', <EM>n</EM>', <EM>d</EM>', <EM>n</EM> and <EM>n</EM>',
which implies that V<SUB>0</SUB>=<EM>m</EM>, V<SUB>1</SUB>=<EM>n</EM>,
V<SUB>2</SUB>=<EM>d</EM>, V<SUB>3</SUB>=<EM>m</EM>', V<SUB>4</SUB>=<EM>n</EM>',
V<SUB>5</SUB>=<EM>d</EM>', V<SUB>6</SUB>=<EM>n</EM>, V<SUB>7</SUB>=<EM>n</EM>'.
<P>The series of operations commanded by the cards, and the results obtained,
may be represented in the following table:--
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=349 src="images/menat2.gif"
width=604> </CENTER>
<P>Since the cards do nothing but indicate in what manner and on what columns
the machine shall act, it is clear that we must still, in every particular case,
introduce the numerical data for the calculation. Thus, in the example we have
selected, we must previously inscribe the numerical values of <EM>m</EM>,
<EM>n</EM>, <EM>d</EM>, <EM>m</EM>', <EM>n</EM>', <EM>d</EM>', in the order and
on the columns indicated, after which the machine when put in action will give
the value of the unknown quantity <EM>x</EM> for this particular case. To obtain
the value of <EM>y</EM>, another series of operations analogous to the preceding
must be performed. But we see that they will be only four in number, since the
denominator of the expression for <EM>y</EM>, excepting the sign, is the same as
that for <EM>x</EM>, and equal to <EM>n</EM>'<EM>m</EM>-<EM>nm</EM>'. In the
preceding table it will be remarked that the column for operations indicates
four successive <EM>multiplications</EM>, two <EM>subtractions</EM>, and one
<EM>division</EM>. Therefore, if desired, we need only use three
operation-cards; to manage which, it is sufficient to introduce into the machine
an apparatus which shall, after the first multiplication, for instance, retain
the card which relates to this operation, and not allow it to advance so as to
be replaced by another one, until after this same operation shall have been four
times repeated. In the preceding example we have seen, that to find the value of
<EM>x</EM> we must begin by writing the coefficients <EM>m</EM>, <EM>n</EM>,
<EM>d</EM>, <EM>m</EM>', <EM>n</EM>', <EM>d</EM>', upon eight columns, thus
repeating <EM>n</EM> and <EM>n</EM>' twice. According to the same method, if it
were required to calculate <EM>y</EM> likewise, these coefficients must be
written on twelve different columns. But it is possible to simplify this
process, and thus to diminish the chances of errors, which chances are greater,
the larger the number of the quantities that have to be inscribed previous to
setting the machine in action. To understand this simplification, we must
remember that every number written on a column must, in order to be
arithmetically combined with another number, be effaced from the column on which
it is, and transferred to the <EM>mill</EM>. Thus, in the example we have
discussed, we will take the two coefficients <EM>m</EM> and <EM>n</EM>', which
are each of them to enter into <EM>two</EM> different products, that is
<EM>m</EM> into <EM>mn</EM>' and <EM>md</EM>', <EM>n</EM>' into <EM>mn</EM>' and
<EM>n</EM>'<EM>d</EM>. These coefficients will be inscribed on the columns
V<SUB>0</SUB> and V<SUB>4</SUB>. If we commence the series of operations by the
product of <EM>m</EM> into <EM>n</EM>', these numbers will be effaced from the
columns V<SUB>0</SUB> and V<SUB>4</SUB>, that they may be transferred to the
mill, which will multiply them into each other, and will then command the
machine to represent the result, say on the column V<SUB>6</SUB>. But as these
numbers are each to be used again in another operation, they must again be
inscribed somewhere; therefore, while the mill is working out their product, the
machine will inscribe them anew on any two columns that may be indicated to it
through the cards; and as, in the actual case, there is no reason why they
should not resume their former places, we will suppose them again inscribed on
V<SUB>0</SUB> and V<SUB>4</SUB>, whence in short they would not finally
disappear, to be reproduced no more, until they should have gone through all the
combinations in which they might have to be used.
<P><A name=menaref3>We see, then,</A> that the whole assemblage of operations
requisite for resolving the <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#noteD">two above equations</A>
of the first degree may be definitely represented in the following table:--
<P>

<P>In order to diminish to the utmost the chances of error in inscribing the
numerical data of the problem, they are successively placed on one of the
columns of the mill; then, by means of cards arranged for this purpose, these
same numbers are caused to arrange themselves on the requisite columns, without
the operator having to give his attention to it; so that his undivided mind may
be applied to the simple inscription of these same numbers.
<P>According to what has now been explained, we see that the collection of
columns of Variables may be regarded as a <EM>store</EM> of numbers, accumulated
there by the mill, and which, obeying the orders transmitted to the machine by
means of the cards, pass alternately from the mill to the store and from the
store to the mill, that they may undergo the transformations demanded by the
nature of the calculation to be performed.
<P><A name=notes4>Hitherto no mention</A> has been made of the <EM>signs</EM> in
the results, and the machine would be far from perfect were it incapable of
expressing and combining amongst each other positive and negative quantities. To
accomplish this end, there is, above every column, both of the mill and of the
store, a disc, similar to the discs of which the columns themselves consist.
According as the digit on this disc is even or uneven, the number inscribed on
the corresponding column below it will be considered as positive or negative.
This granted, we may, in the following manner, conceive how the signs can be
algebraically combined in the machine. When a number is to be transferred from
the store to the mill, and <EM>vice versâ</EM>, it will always be transferred
with its sign, which will effected by means of the cards, as has been explained
in what precedes. Let any two numbers then, on which we are to operate
arithmetically, be placed in the mill with their respective signs. Suppose that
we are first to add them together; the operation-cards will command the
addition: if the two numbers be of the same sign, one of the two will be
entirely effaced from where it was inscribed, and will go to add itself on the
column which contains the other number; the machine will, during this operation,
be able, by means of a certain apparatus, to prevent any movement in the disc of
signs which belongs to the column on which the addition is made, and thus the
result will remain with the sign which the two given numbers originally had.
When two numbers have two different signs, the addition commanded by the card
will be changed into a subtraction through the intervention of mechanisms which
are brought into play by this very difference of sign. Since the subtraction can
only be effected on the larger of the two numbers, it must be arranged that the
disc of signs of the larger number shall not move while the smaller of the two
numbers is being effaced from its column and subtracted from the other, whence
the result will have the sign of this latter, just as in fact it ought to be.
The combinations to which algebraical subtraction give rise, are analogous to
the preceding. Let us pass on to multiplication. When two numbers to be
multiplied are of the same sign, the result is positive; if the signs are
different, the product must be negative. In order that the machine may act
conformably to this law, we have but to conceive that on the column containing
the product of the two given numbers, the digit which indicates the sign of that
product has been formed by the mutual addition of the two digits that
respectively indicated the signs of the two given numbers; it is then obvious
that if the digits of the signs are both even, or both odd, their sum will be an
even number, and consequently will express a positive number; but that if, on
the contrary, the two digits of the signs are one even and the other odd, their
sum will be an odd number, and will consequently express a negative number. In
the case of division. instead of adding the digits of the discs, they must be
subtracted one from the other, which will produce results analogous to the
preceding; that is to say, that if these figures are both even or both uneven,
the remainder of this subtraction will be even; and it will be uneven in the
contrary case. When I speak of mutually adding or subtracting the numbers
expressed by the digits of the signs, I merely mean that one of the sign-discs
is made to advance or retrograde a number of divisions equal to that which is
expressed by the digit on the other sign-disc. We see, then, from the preceding
explanation, that it is possible mechanically to combine the signs of quantities
so as to obtain results conformable to those <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note5"
name=BKnote5>indicated by algebra</A>.
<P>The machine is not only capable of executing those numerical calculations
which depend on a given algebraical formula, but it is also fitted for
analytical calculations in which there are one or several variables to be
considered. It must be assumed that the analytical expression to be operated on
can be developed according to powers of the variable, or according to
determinate functions of this same variable, such as circular functions, for
instance; and similarly for the result that is to be attained. If we then
suppose that above the columns of the store, we have inscribed the powers or the
functions of the variable, arranged according to whatever is the prescribed law
of development, the coefficients of these several terms may be respectively
placed on the corresponding column below each. In this manner we shall have a
representation of an analytical development; and, supposing the position of the
several terms composing it to be invariable, the problem will be reduced to that
of calculating their coefficients according to the laws demanded by the nature
of the question. In order to make this more clear, we shall take the following
<A href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#noteE">very simple
example</A>, in which we are to multiply (<EM>a</EM> + <EM>bx</EM>¹) by (A + B
cos¹&nbsp;<EM>x</EM>). We shall begin by writing <EM>x</EM><SUP>0</SUP> ,
<EM>x</EM>¹, cos<SUP>0</SUP>&nbsp;<EM>x</EM>, cos¹&nbsp;<EM>x</EM>, above the
columns V<SUB>0</SUB>, V<SUB>1</SUB>, V<SUB>2</SUB>, V<SUB>3</SUB>; then since,
from the form of the two functions to be combined, the terms which are to
compose the products will be of the following nature,
<EM>x</EM><SUP>0</SUP>·cos<SUP>0</SUP>&nbsp;<EM>x</EM>,
<EM>x</EM><SUP>0</SUP>·cos¹&nbsp;<EM>x</EM>,
<EM>x</EM>¹·cos<SUP>0</SUP>&nbsp;<EM>x</EM>, <EM>x</EM>¹·cos¹&nbsp;<EM>x</EM>,
these will be inscribed above the columns V<SUB>4</SUB>, V<SUB>5</SUB>,
V<SUB>6</SUB>, V<SUB>7</SUB>. The coefficients of <EM>x</EM><SUP>0</SUP>,
<EM>x</EM>¹, cos<SUP>0</SUP>&nbsp;<EM>x</EM>, cos¹&nbsp;<EM>x</EM> being given,
they will, by means of the mill, be passed to the columns V<SUB>0</SUB>,
V<SUB>1</SUB>, V<SUB>2</SUB> and V<SUB>3</SUB>. Such are the primitive data of
the problem. It is now the business of the machine to work out its solution,
that is, to find the coefficients which are to be inscribed on V<SUB>4</SUB>,
V<SUB>5</SUB>, V<SUB>6</SUB>, V<SUB>7</SUB>. To attain this object, the law of
formation of these same coefficients being known, the machine will act through
the intervention of the cards, in the manner indicated by the <A

<P><A name=menaref2>It will now be perceived</A> that a general application may
be made of the principle developed in the preceding example, to every species of
process which it may be proposed to effect on series submitted to calculation.
It is sufficient that the law of formation of the coefficients be known, and
that this law be inscribed on the cards of the machine, which will then of
itself execute all the calculations requisite for arriving at the proposed
result. If, for instance, a recurring series were proposed, the law of formation
of the coefficients being here uniform, the same operations which must be
performed for one of them will be repeated for all the others; there will merely
be a change in the locality of the operation, that is, it will be performed with
different columns. Generally, since every analytical expression is susceptible
of being expressed in a series ordered according to certain functions of the
variable, we perceive that the machine will include all analytical calculations
which can be definitively reduced to the formation of coefficients according to
certain laws, and to the distribution of these with respect to the variables.
<P><A name=menaref6>We may deduce</A> the following important consequence from
these explanations, viz. that since the cards only indicate the nature of the
operations to be performed, and the columns of Variables with which they are to
be executed, these cards will themselves possess all the generality of analysis,
of which they are in fact merely a translation. We shall now further examine
some of the difficulties which the machine must surmount, if its assimilation to
analysis is to be complete. There are certain functions which necessarily change
in nature when they pass through zero or infinity, or whose values cannot be
admitted when they pass these limits. When such cases present themselves, the
machine is able, by means of a bell, to give notice that the passage through
zero or infinity is taking place, and it then stops until the attendant has
again set it in action for whatever process it may next be desired that it shall
perform. If this process has been foreseen, then the machine, instead of
ringing, will so dispose itself as to present the new cards which have relation
to the operation that is to succeed the passage through zero and infinity. These
new cards may follow the first, but may only come into play contingently upon
one or other of the two circumstances just mentioned taking place.
<P>Let us consider a term of the form <EM>ab<SUP>n</SUP></EM>; since the cards
are but a translation of the analytical formula, their number in this particular
case must be the same, whatever be the value of <EM>n</EM>; that is to say,
whatever be the number of multiplications required for elevating <EM>b</EM> to
the <EM>n</EM>th power (we are supposing for the moment that <EM>n</EM> is a
whole number). Now, since the exponent <EM>n</EM> indicates that <EM>b</EM> is
to be multiplied <EM>n</EM> times by itself, and all these operations are of the
same nature, it will be sufficient to employ one single operation-card, viz.
that which orders the multiplication.
<P>But when <EM>n</EM> is given for the particular case to be calculated, it
will be further requisite that the machine limit the number of its
multiplications according to the given values. The process may be thus arranged.
The three numbers <EM>a</EM>, <EM>b</EM> and <EM>n</EM> will be written on as
many distinct columns of the store; we shall designate them V<SUB>0</SUB>,
V<SUB>1</SUB>, V<SUB>2</SUB>; the result <EM>ab<SUP>n</SUP></EM> will place
itself on the column V<SUB>3</SUB>. When the number <EM>n</EM> has been
introduced into the machine, a card will order a certain registering-apparatus
to mark (<EM>n</EM>-1), and will at the same time execute the multiplication of
<EM>b</EM> by <EM>b</EM>. When this is completed, it will be found that the
registering-apparatus has effaced a unit, and that it only marks (<EM>n</EM>-2);
while the machine will now again order the number <EM>b</EM> written on the
column V<SUB>1</SUB> to multiply itself with the product <EM>b<SUP>2</SUP></EM>
written on the column V<SUB>3</SUB>, which will give <EM>b<SUP>3</SUP></EM>.
Another unit is then effaced from the registering-apparatus, and the same
processes are continually repeated until it only marks zero. Thus the number
<EM>b<SUP>n</SUP></EM> will be found inscribed on V<SUB>3</SUB>, when the
machine, pursuing its course of operations, will order the product of
<EM>b<SUP>n</SUP></EM> by <EM>a</EM>; and the required calculation will have
been completed without there being any necessity that the number of
operation-cards used should vary with the value of <EM>n</EM>. If <EM>n</EM>
were negative, the cards, instead of ordering the multiplication of <EM>a</EM>
by <EM>b<SUP>n</SUP></EM>, would order its division; this we can easily
conceive, since every number, being inscribed with its respective sign, is
consequently capable of reacting on the nature of the operations to be executed.
Finally, if <EM>n</EM> were fractional, of the form <EM>p</EM>/<EM>q</EM>, an
additional column would be used for the inscription of <EM>q</EM>, and the
machine would bring into action two sets of processes, one for raising
<EM>b</EM> to the power <EM>p</EM>, the other for extracting the <EM>q</EM>th
root of the number so obtained.
<P>Again, it may be required, for example, to multiply an expression of the form
<EM>ax<SUP>m</SUP></EM>+<EM>bx<SUP>n</SUP></EM> by another
A<EM>x<SUP>p</SUP></EM>+B<EM>x<SUP>q</SUP></EM>, and then to reduce the product
to the least number of terms, if any of the indices are equal. The two factors
being ordered with respect to x, the general result of the multiplication would
be
A<EM>ax</EM><SUP><EM>m</EM>+<EM>p</EM></SUP>+A<EM>bx</EM><SUP><EM>n</EM>+<EM>p</EM></SUP>+B<EM>ax</EM><SUP><EM>m</EM>+<EM>q</EM></SUP>+B<EM>bx</EM><SUP><EM>n</EM>+<EM>q</EM></SUP>.
Up to this point the process presents no difficulties; but suppose that we have
<EM>m</EM>=<EM>p</EM> and <EM>n</EM>=<EM>q</EM>, and that we wish to reduce the
two middle terms to a single one
(A<EM>b</EM>+B<EM>a</EM>)<EM>x</EM><SUP><EM>m</EM>+<EM>q</EM></SUP>. For this
purpose, the cards may order <EM>m</EM>+<EM>q</EM> and <EM>n</EM>+<EM>p</EM> to
be transferred into the mill, and there subtracted one from the other; if the
remainder is nothing, as would be the case on the present hypothesis, the mill
will order other cards to bring to it the coefficients A<EM>b</EM> and
B<EM>a</EM>, that it may add them together and give them in this state as a
coefficient for the single term
<EM>x</EM><SUP><EM>n</EM>+<EM>p</EM></SUP>=<EM>x</EM><SUP><EM>m</EM>+<EM>q</EM></SUP>.

<P>This example illustrates how the cards are able to reproduce all the
operations which intellect performs in order to attain a determinate result, if
these operations are themselves capable of being precisely defined.
<P>Let us now examine the following expression:--
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=43 src="images/menaeq3.gif"
width=352> </CENTER>
<P>which we know becomes equal to the ratio of the circumference to the
diameter, when <EM>n</EM> is infinite. We may require the machine not only to
perform the calculation of this fractional expression, but further to give
indication as soon as the value becomes identical with that of the ratio of the
circumference to the diameter when <EM>n</EM> is infinite, a case in which the
computation would be impossible. Observe that we should thus require of the
machine to interpret a result not of itself evident, and that this is not
amongst its attributes, since it is no thinking being. Nevertheless, when the
cos of <EM>n</EM>=1/0 has been foreseen, a card may immediately order the
substitution of the value of <IMG alt=Pi height=10
src="images/pi.gif" width=11> (<IMG alt=Pi height=10
src="images/pi.gif" width=11> being the ratio of the
circumference to the diameter), without going through the series of calculations
indicated. This would merely require that the machine contain a special card,
whose office it should be to place the number <IMG alt=Pi height=10
src="images/pi.gif" width=11> in a direct and
independent manner on the column indicated to it. <A name=notes3>And here</A> we
should introduce the mention of a third species of cards, which may be called
<EM>cards of numbers</EM>. There are certain numbers, such as those expressing
the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, the Numbers of Bernoulli,
&amp;c., which frequently present themselves in calculations. To avoid the
necessity for computing them every time they have to be used, certain cards may
be combined specially in order to give these numbers ready made into the mill,
whence they afterwards go and place themselves on those columns of the store
that are destined for them. Through this means the machine will be susceptible
of those simplifications afforded by the use of numerical tables. It would be
equally possible to introduce, by means of these cards, the logarithms of
numbers; but perhaps it might not be in this case either the shortest or the
most appropriate method; for the machine might be able to perform the same
calculations by other more expeditious combinations, founded on the rapidity
with which it executes the first four operations of arithmetic. To give an idea
of this rapidity, we need only mention that Mr. Babbage believes he can, by his
engine, form the product of two numbers, each containing twenty figures, in
<EM>three minutes</EM>.
<P>Perhaps the immense number of cards required for the solution of any rather
complicated problem may appear to be an obstacle; but this does not seem to be
the case. There is no limit to the number of cards that can he used. Certain
stuffs require for their fabrication not less than <EM>twenty thousand</EM>
cards, and we may unquestionably far exceed <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#noteF">even this quantity</A>.

<P>Resuming what we have explained concerning the Analytical Engine, we may
conclude that it is based on two principles: the first consisting in the fact
that every arithmetical calculation ultimately depends on four principal
operations--addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; the second, in
the possibility of reducing every analytical calculation to that of the
coefficients for the several terms of a series. If this last principle be true,
all the operations of analysis come within the domain of the engine. To take
another point of view: the use of the cards offers a generality equal to that of
algebraical formulæ, since such a formula simply indicates the nature and order
of the operations requisite for arriving at a certain definite result, and
similarly the cards merely command the engine to perform these same operations;
but in order that the mechanisms may be able to act to any purpose, the
numerical data of the problem must in every particular case be introduced. Thus
the same series of cards will serve for all questions whose sameness of nature
is such as to require nothing altered excepting the numerical data. In this
light the cards are merely a translation of algebraical formulæ, or, to express
it better, another form of analytical notation.
<P>Since the engine has a mode of acting peculiar to itself, it will in every
particular case be necessary to arrange the series of calculations conformably
to the means which the machine possesses; for such or such a process which might
be very easy for a calculator may be long and complicated for the engine, and
<EM>vice versâ</EM>.
<P>Considered under the most general point of view, the essential object of the
machine being to calculate, according to the laws dictated to it, the values of
numerical coefficients which it is then to distribute appropriately on the
columns which represent the variables, it follows that the interpretation of
formulæ and of results is beyond its province, unless indeed this very
interpretation be itself susceptible of expression by means of the symbols which
the machine employs. Thus, although it is not itself the being that reflects, it
may yet be considered as the being which executes the <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteG">conceptions of
intelligence</A>. The cards receive the impress of these conceptions, and
transmit to the various trains of mechanism composing the engine the orders
necessary for their action. When once the engine shall have been constructed,
the difficulty will be reduced to the making out of the cards; but as these are
merely the translation of algebraical formulæ, it will, by means of some simple
notations, be easy to consign the execution of them to a workman. Thus the whole
intellectual labour will be limited to the preparation of the formulæ, which
must be adapted for calculation by the engine.
<P>Now, admitting that such an engine can be constructed, it may be inquired:
what will be its utility? To recapitulate; it will afford the following
advantages:--First, rigid accuracy. We know that numerical calculations are
generally the stumbling-block to the solution of problems, since errors easily
creep into them, and it is by no means always easy to detect these errors. Now
the engine, by the very nature of its mode of acting, which requires no human
intervention during the course of its operations, presents every species of
security under the head of correctness: besides, it carries with it its own
check; for at the end of every operation it prints off, not only the results,
but likewise the numerical data of the question; so that it is easy to verify
whether the question has been correctly proposed. Secondly, economy of time: to
convince ourselves of this, we need only recollect that the multiplication of
two numbers, consisting each of twenty figures, requires at the very utmost
three minutes. Likewise, when a long series of identical computations is to be
performed, such as those required for the formation of numerical tables, the
machine can be brought into play so as to give several results at the same time,
which will greatly abridge the whole amount of the processes. Thirdly, economy
of intelligence: a simple arithmetical computation requires to be performed by a
person possessing some capacity; and when we pass to more complicated
calculations, and wish to use algebraical formulæ in particular cases, knowledge
must be possessed which presupposes preliminary mathematical studies of some
extent. Now the engine, from its capability of performing by itself all these
purely material operations, spares intellectual labour, which may be more
profitably employed. Thus the engine may be considered as a real manufactory of
figures, which will lend its aid to those many useful sciences and arts that
depend on numbers. Again, who can foresee the consequences of such an invention?
In truth, how many precious observations remain practically barren for the
progress of the sciences, because there are not powers sufficient for computing
the results! And what discouragement does the perspective of a long and arid
computation cast into the mind of a man of genius, who demands time exclusively
for meditation, and who beholds it snatched from him by the material routine of
operations! Yet it is by the laborious route of analysis that he must reach
truth; but he cannot pursue this unless guided by numbers; for without numbers
it is not given us to raise the veil which envelopes the mysteries of nature.
Thus the idea of constructing an apparatus capable of aiding human weakness in
such researches, is a conception which, being realized, would mark a glorious
epoch in the history of the sciences. The plans have been arranged for all the
various parts, and for all the wheel-work, which compose this immense apparatus,
and their action studied; but these have not yet been fully combined together in
<A href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note6"
name=BKnote6>the drawings</A> and <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note7"
name=BKnote7>mechanical notation</A>. The confidence which the genius of Mr.
Babbage must inspire, affords legitimate ground for hope that this enterprise
will be crowned with success; and while we render homage to the intelligence
which directs it, let us breathe aspirations for the accomplishment of such an
undertaking.

all other series which are capable of tabulation by the Method of Differences.
<BR clear=right>
<P>The Analytical Engine, on the contrary, is not merely adapted for
<EM>tabulating</EM> the results of one particular function and of no other, but
for <EM>developing and tabulating</EM> any function whatever. In fact the engine
may be described as being the material expression of any indefinite function of
any degree of generality and complexity, such as for instance,
<P>
<CENTER>F(<EM>x</EM>, <EM>y</EM>, <EM>z</EM>, log <EM>x</EM>, sin <EM>y</EM>,
<EM>x<SUP>&nbsp;p</SUP></EM>, &amp;c.), </CENTER>
<P>which is, it will be observed, a function of all other possible functions of
any number of quantities.
<P>In this, which we may call the <EM>neutral</EM> or <EM>zero</EM> state of the
engine, it is ready to receive at any moment, by means of cards constituting a
portion of its mechanism (and applied on the principle of those used in the
Jacquard-loom), the impress of whatever <EM>special</EM> function we may desire
to develope or to tabulate. These cards contain within themselves (in a manner
<A href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#menaref1">explained in the
Memoir itself</A>) the law of development of the particular function that may be
under consideration, and they compel the mechanism to act accordingly in a
certain corresponding order. One of the simplest cases would be for example, to
suppose that
<P>
<CENTER>F(<EM>x</EM>, <EM>y</EM>, <EM>z</EM>, &amp;c. &amp;c.) </CENTER>
<P>is the particular function
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=21 src="images/adaeq2.gif"
width=94> </CENTER>
<P>which the Difference Engine tabulates for values of <EM>n</EM> only up to 7.
In this case the cards would order the mechanism to go through that succession
of operations which would tabulate
<P>
<CENTER><EM>u<SUB>z</SUB></EM> = <EM>a</EM> + <EM>bx</EM> +
<EM>cx</EM><SUP>2</SUP> + ··· + <EM>mx</EM><SUP>n-1</SUP> </CENTER>
<P>where <EM>n</EM> might be any number whatever.
<P>These cards, however, have nothing to do with the regulation of the
particular <EM>numerical</EM> data. They merely determine the <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note10"
name=BKnote10><EM>operations</EM></A> to be effected, which operations may of
course be performed on an infinite variety of particular numerical values, and
do not bring out any definite numerical results unless the numerical data of the
problem have been impressed on the requisite portions of the train of mechanism.
In the above example, the first essential step towards an arithmetical result
would be the substitution of specific numbers for <EM>n</EM>, and for the other
primitive quantities which enter into the function.
<P>Again, let us suppose that for F we put two complete equations of the fourth
degree between <EM>x</EM> and <EM>y</EM>. We must then express on the cards the
law of elimination for such equations. The engine would follow out those laws,
and would ultimately give the equation of one variable which results from such
elimination. Various <EM>modes</EM> of elimination might be selected; and of
course the cards must be made out accordingly. The following is one mode that
might be adopted. The engine is able to multiply together any two functions of
the form
<P>
<CENTER><EM>a</EM> + <EM>bx</EM> + <EM>cx</EM><SUP>2</SUP> + ··· +
<EM>px</EM><SUP>n</SUP>. </CENTER>
<P>This granted, the two equations may be arranged according to the powers of
<EM>y</EM>, and the coefficients of the powers of <EM>y</EM> may be arranged
according to powers of <EM>x</EM>. The elimination of <EM>y</EM> will result
from the successive multiplications and subtractions of several such functions.
In this, and in all other instances, as was explained above, the particular
<EM>numerical</EM> data and the <EM>numerical</EM> results are determined by
means and by portions of the mechanism which act quite independently of those
that regulate the <EM>operations</EM>.
<P>In studying the action of the Analytical Engine, we find that the peculiar
and independent nature of the considerations which in all mathematical analysis
belong to <EM>operations</EM>, as distinguished from <EM>the objects operated
upon</EM> and from the <EM>results</EM> of the operations performed upon those
objects, is very strikingly defined and separated.
<P>It is well to draw attention to this point, not only because its full
appreciation is essential to the attainment of any very just and adequate
general comprehension of the powers and mode of action of the Analytical Engine,
but also because it is one which is perhaps too little kept in view in the study
of mathematical science in general. It is, however, impossible to confound it
with other considerations, either when we trace the manner in which that engine
attains its results, or when we prepare the data for its attainment of those
results. It were much to be desired, that when mathematical processes pass
through the human brain instead of through the medium of inanimate mechanism, it
were equally a necessity of things that the reasonings connected with
<EM>operations</EM> should hold the same just place as a clear and well-defined
branch of the subject of analysis, a fundamental but yet independent ingredient
in the science, which they must do in studying the engine. The confusion, the
difficulties, the contradictions which, in consequence of a want of accurate
distinctions in this particular, have up to even a recent period encumbered
mathematics in all those branches involving the consideration of negative and
impossible quantities, will at once occur to the reader who is at all versed in
this science, and would alone suffice to justify dwelling somewhat on the point,
in connexion with any subject so peculiarly fitted to give forcible illustration
of it as the Analytical Engine. It may be desirable to explain, that by the word
<EM>operation</EM>, we mean <EM>any process which alters the mutual relation of
two or more things</EM>, be this relation of what kind it may. This is the most
general definition, and would include all subjects in the universe. In abstract
mathematics, of course operations alter those particular relations which are
involved in the considerations of number and space, and the <EM>results</EM> of
operations are those peculiar results which correspond to the nature of the
subjects of operation. But the science of operations, as derived from
mathematics more especially, is a science of itself, and has its own abstract
truth and value; just as logic has its own peculiar truth and value,
independently of the subjects to which we may apply its reasonings and
processes. Those who are accustomed to some of the more modern views of the
above subject, will know that a few fundamental relations being true, certain
other combinations of relations must of necessity follow; combinations unlimited
in variety and extent if the deductions from the primary relations be carried on
far enough. They will also be aware that one main reason why the separate nature
of the science of operations has been little felt, and in general little dwelt
on, is the <EM>shifting</EM> meaning of many of the symbols used in mathematical
notation. First, the symbols of <EM>operation</EM> are frequently <EM>also</EM>
the symbols of the <EM>results</EM> of operations. We may say that these symbols
are apt to have both a <EM>retrospective</EM> and a <EM>prospective</EM>
signification. They may signify either relations that are the consequences of a
series of processes already performed, or relations that are yet to be effected
through certain processes. Secondly, figures, the symbols of <EM>numerical
magnitude</EM>, are frequently <EM>also</EM> the symbols of <EM>operations</EM>,
as when they are the indices of powers. Wherever terms have a shifting meaning,
independent sets of considerations are liable to become complicated together,
and reasonings and results are frequently falsified. Now in the Analytical
Engine, the operations which come under the first of the above heads are ordered
and combined by means of a notation and of a train of mechanism which belong
exclusively to themselves; and with respect to the second head, whenever numbers
meaning <EM>operations</EM> and not <EM>quantities</EM> (such as the indices of
powers) are inscribed on any column or set of columns, those columns immediately
act in a wholly separate and independent manner, becoming connected with the
<EM>operating mechanism</EM> exclusively, and re-acting upon this. They never
come into combination with numbers upon any other columns meaning
<EM>quantities</EM>; though, of course, if there are numbers meaning
<EM>operations</EM> upon <EM>n</EM> columns, these may <EM>combine amongst each
other</EM>, and will often be required to do so, just as numbers meaning
<EM>quantities</EM> combine with each other in any variety. It might have been
arranged that all numbers meaning <EM>operations</EM> should have appeared on
some separate portion of the engine from that which presents numerical
<EM>quantities</EM>; but the present mode is in some cases more simple, and
offers in reality quite as much distinctness when understood.
<P>The operating mechanism can even be thrown into action independently of any
object to operate upon (although of course no <EM>result</EM> could then be
developed). Again, it might act upon other things besides <EM>number</EM>, were
objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of
the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of
adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine.
Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the
science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such
expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific
pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.
<P>The Analytical Engine is an <EM>embodying of the science of operations</EM>,
constructed with peculiar reference to abstract number as the subject of those
operations. The Difference Engine is the embodying of <EM>one particular and
very limited set of operations</EM>, which (see the notation used in <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteB">Note B</A>) may be
expressed thus (+, +, +, +, +, +), or thus, 6(+). Six repetitions of the one
operation, +, is, in fact, the whole sum and object of that engine. It has seven
columns, and a number on any column can add itself to a number on the next
column to its <EM>right-hand</EM>. So that, beginning with the column furthest
to the left, six additions can be effected, and the result appears on the
seventh column, which is the last on the right-hand. The <EM>operating</EM>
mechanism of this engine acts in as separate and independent a manner as that of
the Analytical Engine; but being susceptible of only one unvarying and
restricted combination, it has little force or interest in illustration of the
distinct nature of the <EM>science of operations</EM>. The importance of
regarding the Analytical Engine under this point of view will, we think, become
more and more obvious as the reader proceeds with M. Menabrea's clear and
masterly article. The calculus of operations is likewise in itself a topic of so
much interest, and has of late years been so much more written on and thought on
than formerly, that any bearing which that engine, from its mode of
constitution, may possess upon the illustration of this branch of mathematical
science should not be overlooked. Whether the inventor of this engine had any
such views in his mind while working out the invention, or whether he may
subsequently ever have regarded it under this phase, we do not know; but it is
one that forcibly occurred to ourselves on becoming acquainted with the means
through which analytical combinations are actually attained by the mechanism. We
cannot forbear suggesting one practical result which it appears to us must be
greatly facilitated by the independent manner in which the engine orders and
combines its <EM>operations</EM>: we allude to the attainment of those
combinations into which <EM>imaginary quantities</EM> enter. This is a branch of
its processes into which we have not had the opportunity of inquiring, and our
conjecture therefore as to the principle on which we conceive the accomplishment
of such results may have been made to depend, is very probably not in accordance
with the fact, and less subservient for the purpose than some other principles,
or at least requiring the cooperation of others. It seems to us obvious,
however, that where operations are so independent in their mode of acting, it
must be easy, by means of a few simple provisions, and additions in arranging
the mechanism, to bring out a <EM>double</EM> set of <EM>results</EM>,
viz.--1st, the <EM>numerical magnitudes</EM> which are the results of operations
performed on <EM>numerical data</EM>. (These results are the <EM>primary</EM>
object of the engine.) 2ndly, the <EM>symbolical results</EM> to be attached to
those numerical results, which symbolical results are not less the necessary and
logical consequences of operations performed upon <EM>symbolical data</EM>, than
are numerical results when the data are <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note11"
name=BKnote11>numerical</A>.
<P>If we compare together the powers and the principles of construction of the
Difference and of the Analytical Engines, we shall perceive that the
capabilities of the latter are immeasurably more extensive than those of the
former, and that they in fact hold to each other the same relationship as that
of analysis to arithmetic. The Difference Engine can effect but one particular
series of operations, viz. that required for tabulating the integral of the
special function
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=22 src="images/adaeq3.gif"
width=99> </CENTER>
<P>and as it can only do this for values of <EM>n</EM> <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note12" name=BKnote12>up
to 7</A>, it cannot be considered as being the most <EM>general</EM> expression
even of <EM>one particular</EM> function, much less as being the expression of
any and all possible functions of all degrees of generality. The Difference
Engine can in reality (as has been already partly explained) do nothing but
<EM>add</EM>; and any other processes, not excepting those of simple
subtraction, multiplication and division, can be performed by it only just to
that extent in which it is possible, by judicious mathematical arrangement and
artifices, to reduce them to a <EM>series of additions</EM>. The method of
differences is, in fact, a method of additions; and as it includes within its
means a larger number of results attainable by <EM>addition</EM> simply, than
any other mathematical principle, it was very appropriately selected as the
basis on which to construct <EM>an Adding Machine</EM>, so as to give to the
powers of such a machine the widest possible range. The Analytical Engine, on
the contrary, can either add, subtract, multiply or divide with equal facility;
and performs each of these four operations in a direct manner, without the aid
of any of the other three. This one fact implies everything; and it is scarcely
necessary to point out, for instance, that while the Difference Engine can
merely <EM>tabulate</EM>, and is incapable of <EM>developing</EM>, the
Analytical Engine can either <EM>tabulate or develope</EM>.
<P>The former engine is in its nature strictly <EM>arithmetical</EM>, and the
results it can arrive at lie within a very clearly defined and restricted range,
while there is no finite line of demarcation which limits the powers of the
Analytical Engine. These powers are co-extensive with our knowledge of the laws
of analysis itself, and need be bounded only by our acquaintance with the
latter. Indeed we may consider the engine as the <EM>material and mechanical
representative</EM> of analysis, and that our actual working powers in this
department of human study will be enabled more effectually than heretofore to
keep pace with our theoretical knowledge of its principles and laws, through the
complete control which the engine gives us over the <EM>executive
manipulation</EM> of algebraical and numerical symbols.
<P>Those who view mathematical science, not merely as a vast body of abstract
and immutable truths, whose intrinsic beauty, symmetry and logical completeness,
when regarded in their connexion together as a whole, entitle them to a
prominent place in the interest of all profound and logical minds, but as
possessing a yet deeper interest for the human race, when it is remembered that
this science constitutes the language through which alone we can adequately
express the great facts of the natural world, and those unceasing changes of
mutual relationship which, visibly or invisibly, consciously or unconsciously to
our immediate physical perceptions, are interminably going on in the agencies of
the creation we live amidst: those who thus think on mathematical truth as the
instrument through which the weak mind of man can most effectually read his
Creator's works, will regard with especial interest all that can tend to
facilitate the translation of its principles into explicit practical forms.
<P>The distinctive characteristic of the Analytical Engine, and that which has
rendered it possible to endow mechanism with such extensive faculties as bid
fair to make this engine the executive right-hand of abstract algebra, is the
introduction into it of the principle which Jacquard devised for regulating, by
means of punched cards, the most complicated patterns in the fabrication of
brocaded stuffs. It is in this that the distinction between the two engines
lies. Nothing of the sort exists in the Difference Engine. We may say most
aptly, that the Analytical Engine <EM>weaves algebraical patterns</EM> just as
the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves. Here, it seems to us, resides much
more of originality than the Difference Engine can be fairly entitled to claim.
We do not wish to deny to this latter all such claims. We believe that it is the
only proposal or attempt ever made to construct a calculating machine
<EM>founded on the principle of successive orders of differences</EM>, and
capable of <EM>printing off its own results</EM>; and that this engine surpasses
its predecessors, both in the extent of the calculations which it can perform,
in the facility, certainty and accuracy with which it can effect them, and in
the absence of all necessity for the intervention of human intelligence
<EM>during the performance of its calculations</EM>. Its nature is, however,
limited to the strictly arithmetical, and it is far from being the first or only
scheme for constructing <EM>arithmetical</EM> calculating machines with more or
less of success.
<P>The bounds of <EM>arithmetic</EM> were however outstepped the moment the idea
of applying the cards had occurred; and the Analytical Engine does not occupy
common ground with mere "calculating machines." It holds a position wholly its
own; and the considerations it suggests are most interesting in their nature. In
enabling mechanism to combine together <EM>general</EM> symbols in successions
of unlimited variety and extent, a uniting link is established between the
operations of matter and the abstract mental processes of the <EM>most
abstract</EM> branch of mathematical science. A new, a vast, and a powerful
language is developed for the future use of analysis, in which to wield its
truths so that these may become of more speedy and accurate practical
application for the purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our
possession have rendered possible. Thus not only the mental and the material,
but the theoretical and the practical in the mathematical world, are brought
into more intimate and effective connexion with each other. We are not aware of
its being on record that anything partaking in the nature of what is so well
designated the <EM>Analytical</EM> Engine has been hitherto proposed, or even
thought of, as a practical possibility, any more than the idea of a thinking or
of a reasoning machine.
<P>We will touch on another point which constitutes an important distinction in
the modes of operating of the Difference and Analytical Engines. In order to
enable the former to do its business, it is necessary to put into its columns
the series of numbers constituting the first terms of the several orders of
differences for whatever is the particular table under consideration. The
machine then works <EM>upon</EM> these as its data. But these data must
themselves have been already computed through a series of calculations by a
human head. Therefore that engine can only produce results depending on data
which have been arrived at by the explicit and actual working out of processes
that are in their nature different from any that come within the sphere of its
own powers. In other words, an <EM>analysing</EM> process must have been gone
through by a human mind in order to obtain the data upon which the engine then
<EM>synthetically</EM> builds its results. The Difference Engine is in its
character exclusively <EM>synthetical</EM>, while the Analytical Engine is
equally capable of analysis or of synthesis.
<P>It is true that the Difference Engine can calculate to a much greater extent
with these few preliminary data, than the data themselves required for their own
determination. The table of squares, for instance, can be calculated to any
extent whatever, when the numbers <EM>one</EM> and <EM>two</EM> are furnished;
and a very few differences computed at any part of a table of logarithms would
enable the engine to calculate many hundreds or even thousands of logarithms.
Still the circumstance of its requiring, as a previous condition, that any
function whatever shall have been numerically worked out, makes it very inferior
in its nature and advantages to an engine which, like the Analytical Engine,
requires merely that we should know the <EM>succession and distribution</EM> of
the operations to be performed; without there <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteF">being any occasion</A>,
in order to obtain data on which it can work, for our ever having gone through
either the same particular operations which it is itself to effect, or any
others. Numerical data must of course be given it, but they are mere arbitrary
ones; not data that could only be arrived at through a systematic and necessary
series of previous numerical calculations, which is quite a different thing.
<P>To this it may be replied, that an analysing process must equally have been
performed in order to furnish the Analytical Engine with the necessary
<EM>operative</EM> data; and that herein may also lie a possible source of
error. Granted that the actual mechanism is unerring in its processes, the
<EM>cards</EM> may give it wrong orders. This is unquestionably the case; but
there is much less chance of error, and likewise far less expenditure of time
and labour, where operations only, and the distribution of these operations,
have to be made out, than where explicit numerical results are to be attained.
In the case of the Analytical Engine we have undoubtedly to lay out a certain
capital of analytical labour in one particular line; but this is in order that
the engine may bring us in a much larger return in another line. It should be
remembered also that the cards, when once made out for any formula, have all the
generality of algebra, and include an infinite number of particular cases.
<P>We have dwelt considerably on the distinctive peculiarities of each of these
engines, because we think it essential to place their respective attributes in
strong relief before the apprehension of the public; and to define with
clearness and accuracy the wholly different nature of the principles on which
each is based, so as to make it self-evident to the reader (the mathematical
reader at least) in what manner and degree the powers of the Analytical Engine
transcend those of an engine, which, like the Difference Engine, can only work
out such results as may be derived from <EM>one restricted and particular series
of processes</EM>, such as those included in <IMG align=absMiddle height=15
src="images/adaeq22.gif" width=76>. We think this of
importance, because we know that there exists considerable vagueness and
inaccuracy in the mind of persons in general on the subject. There is a misty
notion amongst most of those who have attended at all to it, that <EM>two</EM>
"calculating machines" have been successively invented by the same person within
the last few years; while others again have never heard but of the one original
"calculating machine," and are not aware of there being any extension upon this.
For either of these two classes of persons the above considerations are
appropriate. While the latter require a knowledge of the fact that there <EM>are
two</EM> such inventions, the former are not less in want of accurate and
well-defined information on the subject. No very clear or correct ideas prevail
as to the characteristics of each engine, or their respective advantages or
disadvantages; and in meeting with those incidental allusions, of a more or less
direct kind, which occur in so many publications of the day, to these machines,
it must frequently be matter of doubt <EM>which</EM> "calculating machine" is
referred to, or whether <EM>both</EM> are included in the general allusion.
<P>We are desirous likewise of removing two misapprehensions which we know
obtain, to some extent, respecting these engines. In the first place it is very
generally supposed that the Difference Engine, after it had been completed up to
a certain point, <EM>suggested</EM> the idea of the Analytical Engine; and that
the second is in fact the improved offspring of the first, and <EM>grew out</EM>
of the existence of its predecessor, through some natural or else accidental
combination of ideas suggested by this one. Such a supposition is in this
instance contrary to the facts; although it seems to be almost an obvious
inference, wherever two inventions, similar in their nature and objects, succeed
each other closely in order of <EM>time</EM>, and strikingly in order of
<EM>value</EM>; more especially when the same individual is the author of both.
Nevertheless the ideas which led to the Analytical Engine occurred in a manner
wholly independent of any that were connected with the Difference Engine. These
ideas are indeed in their own intrinsic nature independent of the latter engine,
and might equally have occurred had it never existed nor been even thought of at
all.
<P>The second of the misapprehensions above alluded to relates to the well-known
suspension, during some years past, of all progress in the construction of the
Difference Engine. Respecting the circumstances which have interfered with the
actual completion of either invention, we offer no opinion; and in fact are not
possessed of the data for doing so, had we the inclination. But we know that
some persons suppose these obstacles (be they what they may) to have arisen
<EM>in consequence</EM> of the subsequent invention of the Analytical Engine
while the former was in progress. We have ourselves heard it even
<EM>lamented</EM> that an idea should ever have occurred at all, which had
turned out to be merely the means of arresting what was already in a course of
successful execution, without substituting the superior invention in its stead.
This notion we can contradict in the most unqualified manner. The progress of
the Difference Engine had long been suspended, before there were even the least
crude glimmerings of any invention superior to it. Such glimmerings, therefore,
and their subsequent development, were in no way the original <EM>cause</EM> of
that suspension; although, where difficulties of some kind or other evidently
already existed, it was not perhaps calculated to remove or lessen them that an
invention should have been meanwhile thought of, which, while including all that
the first was capable of, possesses powers so extended as to eclipse it
altogether.
<P>We leave it for the decision of each individual (<EM>after he has possessed
himself</EM> of competent information as to the characteristics of each engine)
to determine how far it ought to be matter of regret that such an accession has
been made to the powers of human science, even if it <EM>has</EM> (which we
greatly doubt) increased to a certain limited extent some already existing
difficulties that had arisen in the way of completing a valuable but lesser
work. We leave it for each to satisfy himself as to the wisdom of desiring the
obliteration (were that now possible) of all records of the more perfect
invention, in order that the comparatively limited one might be finished. The
Difference Engine would doubtless fulfil all those practical objects which it
was originally destined for. It would certainly calculate all the tables that
are more directly necessary for the physical purposes of life, such as nautical
and other computations. Those who incline to very strictly utilitarian views may
perhaps feel that the peculiar powers of the Analytical Engine bear upon
questions of abstract and speculative science, rather than upon those involving
every-day and ordinary human interests. These persons being likely to possess
hut little sympathy, or possibly acquaintance, with any branches of science
which they do not find to be <EM>useful</EM> (according to <EM>their</EM>
definition of that word), may conceive that the undertaking of that engine, now
that the other one is already in progress, would be a barren and unproductive
laying out of yet more money and labour; in fact, a work of supererogation. Even
in the utilitarian aspect, however, we do not doubt that very valuable practical
results would be developed by the extended faculties of the Analytical Engine;
some of which results we think we could now hint at, had we the space; and
others, which it may not yet be possible to foresee, but which would be brought
forth by the daily increasing requirements of science, and by a more intimate
practical acquaintance with the powers of the engine, were it in actual
existence.
<P>On general grounds, both of an <EM>a priori</EM> description as well as those
founded on the scientific history and experience of mankind, we see strong
presumptions that such would be the case. Nevertheless all will probably concur
in feeling that the completion of the Difference Engine would be far preferable
to the non-completion of any calculating engine at all. With whomsoever or
wheresoever may rest the present causes of difficulty that apparently exist
towards either the completion of the old engine, or the commencement of the new
one, we trust they will not ultimately result in this generation's being
acquainted with these inventions through the medium of pen, ink and paper
merely; and still more do we hope, that for the honour of our country's
reputation in the future pages of history, these causes will not lead to the
completion of the undertaking by some <EM>other</EM> nation or government. This
could not but be matter of just regret; and equally so, whether the obstacles
may have originated in private interests and feelings, in considerations of a
more public description, or in causes combining the nature of both such
solutions.
<P>We refer the reader to the `Edinburgh Review' of July 1834, for a very able
account of the Difference Engine. The writer of the article we allude to has
selected as his prominent matter for exposition, a wholly different view of the
subject from that which M. Menabrea has chosen. The former chiefly treats it
under its mechanical aspect, entering but slightly into the mathematical
principles of which that engine is the representative, but giving, in
considerable length, many details of the mechanism and contrivances by means of
which it tabulates the various orders of differences. M. Menabrea, on the
contrary, exclusively developes the analytical view; taking it for granted that
mechanism is able to perform certain processes, but without attempting to
explain <EM>how</EM>; and devoting his whole attention to explanations and
illustrations of the manner in which analytical laws can be so arranged and
combined as to bring every branch of that vast subject within the grasp of the
assumed powers of mechanism. It is obvious that, in the invention of a
calculating engine, these two branches of the subject are equally essential
fields of investigation, and that on their mutual adjustment, one to the other,
must depend all success. They must be made to meet each other, so that the weak
points in the powers of either department may be compensated by the strong
points in those of the other. They are indissolubly connected, though so
different in their intrinsic nature, that perhaps the same mind might not be
likely to prove equally profound or successful in both. We know those who doubt
whether the powers of mechanism will in practice prove adequate in all respects
to the demands made upon them in the working of such complicated trains of
machinery as those of the above engines, and who apprehend that unforeseen
practical difficulties and disturbances will arise in the way of accuracy and of
facility of operation. The Difference Engine, however, appears to us to be in a
great measure an answer to these doubts. It is complete as far as it goes, and
it does work with all the anticipated success. The Analytical Engine, far from
being more complicated, will in many respects be of simpler construction; and it
is a remarkable circumstance attending it, that with very <EM>simplified</EM>
means it is so much more powerful.
<P>The article in the `Edinburgh Review' was written some time previous to the
occurrence of any ideas such as afterwards led to the invention of the
Analytical Engine; and in the nature of the Difference Engine there is much less
that would invite a writer to take exclusively, or even prominently, the
mathematical view of it, than in that of the Analytical Engine; although
mechanism has undoubtedly gone much further to meet mathematics, in the case of
this engine, than of the former one. Some publication embracing the
<EM>mechanical</EM> view of the Analytical Engine is a desideratum which we
trust will be supplied before long.
<P>Those who may have the patience to study a moderate quantity of rather dry
details will find ample compensation, after perusing the article of 1834, in the
clearness with which a succinct view will have been attained of the various
practical steps through which mechanism can accomplish certain processes; and
they will also find themselves still further capable of appreciating M.
Menabrea's more comprehensive and generalized memoir. The very difference in the
style and object of these two articles makes them peculiarly valuable to each
other; at least for the purposes of those who really desire something more than
a merely superficial and popular comprehension of the subject of calculating
engines.
<P align=right>A. A. L. </P>
<CENTER>
<H3><EM><A name=NoteB>Note B</A></EM></H3></CENTER>That portion of the
Analytical Engine here alluded to is called the storehouse. It contains an
indefinite number of the columns of discs described by M. Menabrea. The reader
may picture to himself a pile of rather large draughtsmen heaped perpendicularly
one above another to a considerable height, each counter having the digits from
0 to 9 inscribed on its <EM>edge</EM> at equal intervals; and if he then
conceives that the counters do not actually lie one upon another so as to be in
contact, but are fixed at small intervals of vertical distance on a common axis
which passes perpendicularly through their centres, and around which each disc
can <EM>revolve horizontally</EM> so that any required digit amongst those
inscribed on its margin can be brought into view, he will have a good idea of
one of these columns. The <EM>lowest</EM> of the discs on any column belongs to
the units, the next above to the tens, the next above this to the hundreds, and
so on. Thus, if we wished to inscribe 1345 on a column of the engine, it would
stand thus:--
<P>
<CENTER>1<BR>3<BR>4<BR>5 </CENTER>
<P>In the Difference Engine there are seven of these columns placed side by side
in a row, and the working mechanism extends behind them: the general form of the
whole mass of machinery is that of a quadrangular prism (more or less
approaching to the cube); the results always appearing on that perpendicular
face of the engine which contains the columns of discs, opposite to which face a
spectator may place himself. In the Analytical Engine there would be many more
of these columns, probably at least two hundred. The precise form and
arrangement which the whole mass of its mechanism will assume is not yet finally
determined.
<P>We may conveniently represent the columns of discs on paper in a diagram like
the following:--
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=199 src="images/noteb1.gif"
width=249> </CENTER>
<P>The V's are for the purpose of convenient reference to any column, either in
writing or speaking, and are consequently numbered. The reason why the letter V
is chosen for the purpose in preference to any other letter, is because these
columns are designated (as the reader will find in proceeding with the Memoir)
the <EM>Variables</EM>, and sometimes the <EM>Variable columns</EM>, or the
<EM>columns of Variables</EM>. The origin of this appellation is, that the
values on the columns are destined to change, that is to <EM>vary</EM>, in every
conceivable manner. But it is necessary to guard against the natural
misapprehension that the columns are only intended to receive the values of the
<EM>variables</EM> in an analytical formula, and not of the <EM>constants</EM>.
The columns are called Variables on a ground wholly unconnected with the
<EM>analytical</EM> distinction between constants and variables. In order to
prevent the possibility of confusion, we have, both in the translation and in
the notes, written Variable with a capital letter when we use the word to
signify a <EM>column of the engine</EM>, and variable with a small letter when
we mean the <EM>variable of a formula</EM>. Similarly, <EM>Variable-cards</EM>
signify any cards that belong to a column of the engine.
<P>To return to the explanation of the diagram: each circle at the top is
intended to contain the algebraic sign + or -, either of which can be <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note13"
name=BKnote13>substituted</A> for the other, according as the number represented
on the column below is positive or negative. In a similar manner any other
purely <EM>symbolical</EM> results of algebraical processes might be made to
appear in these circles. In <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteA">Note A.</A> the
practicability of developing <EM>symbolical</EM> with no less ease than
<EM>numerical</EM> results has been touched on. The zeros beneath the
<EM>symbolic</EM> circles represent each of them a disc, supposed to have the
digit 0 presented in front. Only four tiers of zeros have been figured in the
diagram, but these may be considered as representing thirty or forty, or any
number of tiers of discs that may be required. Since each disc can present any
digit, and each circle any sign, the discs of every column may be <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note14" name=BKnote14>so
adjusted</A> as to express any positive or negative number whatever within the
limits of the machine; which limits depend on the <EM>perpendicular</EM> extent
of the mechanism, that is, on the number of discs to a column.
<P>Each of the squares below the zeros is intended for the inscription of any
<EM>general</EM> symbol or combination of symbols we please; it being understood
that the number represented on the column immediately above is the numerical
value of that symbol, or combination of symbols. Let us, for instance, represent
the three quantities <EM>a</EM>, <EM>n</EM>, <EM>x</EM>, and let us further
suppose that <EM>a</EM> = 5, <EM>n</EM> = 7, <EM>x</EM> = 98. We should have--

<P>We may now combine these symbols in a variety of ways, so as to form any
required function or functions of them, and we may then inscribe each such
function below brackets, every bracket uniting together those quantities (and
those only) which enter into the function inscribed below it. We must also, when
we have decided on the particular function whose numerical value we desire to
calculate, assign another column to the right-hand for receiving the
<EM>results</EM>, and must inscribe the function in the square below this
column. In the above instance we might have any one of the following
functions:--
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=25 src="images/adaeq4.gif"
width=412> </CENTER>
<P>Let us select the first. It would stand as follows, previous to
calculation:--
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=266 src="images/noteb3.gif"
width=299> </CENTER>
<P>The data being given, we must now put into the engine the cards proper for
directing the operations in the case of the particular function chosen. These
operations would in this instance be,--
<P>First, six multiplications in order to get <EM>x<SUP>n</SUP></EM>
(=98<SUP>7</SUP> for the above particular data).
<P>Secondly, one multiplication in order then to get <EM>a·x<SUP>n</SUP></EM>
(=5·98<SUP>7</SUP>).
<P>In all, seven multiplications to complete the whole process. We may thus
represent them:--
<P>
<CENTER>(×, ×, ×, ×, ×, ×, ×), or 7 (×). </CENTER>
<P>The multiplications would, however, at successive stages in the solution of
the problem, operate on pairs of numbers, derived from <EM>different</EM>
columns. In other words, the <EM>same operation</EM> would be performed on
different <EM>subjects of operation</EM>. And here again is an illustration of
the remarks made in the <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteA">preceding Note</A> on
the independent manner in which the engine directs its <EM>operations</EM>. In
determining the value of <EM>ax<SUP>n</SUP></EM>, the <EM>operations</EM> are
<EM>homogeneous</EM>, but are distributed amongst different <EM>subjects of
operation</EM>, at successive stages of the computation. It is by means of
certain punched cards, belonging to the Variables themselves, that the action of
the operations is so <EM>distributed</EM> as to suit each particular function.
The <EM>Operation-cards</EM> merely determine the succession of operations in a
general manner. They in fact throw all that portion of the mechanism included in
the <EM>mill</EM> into a series of different <EM>states</EM>, which we may call
the <EM>adding state</EM>, or the <EM>multiplying state</EM>, &amp;c.
respectively. In each of these states the mechanism is ready to act in the way
peculiar to that state, on any pair of numbers which may be permitted to come
within its sphere of action. Only <EM>one</EM> of these operating states of the
mill can exist at a time; and the nature of the mechanism is also such that only
<EM>one pair of numbers</EM> can be received and acted on at a time. Now, in
order to secure that the mill shall receive a constant supply of the proper
pairs of numbers in succession, and that it shall also rightly locate the result
of an operation performed upon any pair, each Variable has cards of its own
belonging to it. It has, first, a class of cards whose business it is to
<EM>allow</EM> the number on the Variable to pass into the mill, there to be
operated upon. These cards may he called the <EM>Supplying-cards</EM>. They
furnish the mill with its proper food. Each Variable has, secondly, another
class of cards, whose office it is to allow the Variable to <EM>receive</EM> a
number <EM>from</EM> the mill. These cards may be called the
<EM>Receiving-cards</EM>. <EM>They</EM> regulate the location of results,
whether temporary or ultimate results. The Variable-cards in general (including
both the preceding classes) might, it appears to us, be even more appropriately
designated the Distributive-cards, since it is through their means that the
action of the operations, and the results of this action, are rightly
<EM>distributed</EM>.
<P>There are <EM>two varieties</EM> of the <EM>Supplying</EM> Variable-cards,
respectively adapted for fulfilling two distinct subsidiary purposes: but as
these modifications do not bear upon the present subject, we shall notice them
in another place.
<P>In the above case of <EM>ax<SUP>n</SUP></EM>, the Operation-cards merely
order seven multiplications, that is, they order the mill to be in the
<EM>multiplying state</EM> seven successive times (without any reference to the
particular columns whose numbers are to be acted upon). The proper Distributive
Variable-cards step in at each successive multiplication, and cause the
distributions requisite for the particular case.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=77 src="images/adaeq5.gif"
width=481> </CENTER>
<P>The engine might be made to calculate all these in succession. Having
completed <EM>ax<SUP>n</SUP></EM>, the function <EM>x<SUP>an</SUP></EM> might be
written under the brackets instead of <EM>ax<SUP>n</SUP></EM>, and a new
calculation commenced (the appropriate Operation and Variable-cards for the new
function of course coming into play). The results would then appear on
V<SUB>5</SUB>. So on for any number of different functions of the quantities
<EM>a</EM>, <EM>n</EM>, <EM>x</EM>. Each <EM>result</EM> might either
permanently remain on its column during the succeeding calculations, so that
when all the functions had been computed, their values would simultaneously
exist on V<SUB>4</SUB>, V<SUB>5</SUB>, V<SUB>6</SUB>, &amp;c.; or each result
might (after being printed off, or used in any specified manner) be effaced, to
make way for its successor. The square under V<SUB>4</SUB> ought, for the latter
arrangement, to have the functions <EM>ax<SUP>n</SUP></EM>,
<EM>x<SUP>an</SUP></EM>, <EM>anx</EM>, &amp;c. successively inscribed in it.
<P>Let us now suppose that we have <EM>two</EM> expressions whose values have
been computed by the engine independently of each other (each having its own
group of columns for data and results). Let them be <EM>ax<SUP>n</SUP></EM>, and
<EM>bpy</EM>. They would then stand as follows on the columns:--
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=258 src="images/noteb4.gif"
width=575> </CENTER>
<P>We may now desire to combine together these two <EM>results</EM>, in any
manner we please; in which case it would only be necessary to have an additional
card or cards, which should order the requisite operations to be performed with
the numbers on the two result-columns V<SUB>4</SUB> and V<SUB>8</SUB>, and the
<EM>result of these further operations</EM> to appear on a new column,
V<SUB>9</SUB>. Say that we wish to divide <EM>ax<SUP>n</SUP></EM> by
<EM>bpy</EM>. The numerical value of this division would then appear on the
column V<SUB>9</SUB>, beneath which we have inscribed <IMG align=middle
height=34 src="images/noteb5.gif" width=30>. The
whole series of operations from the beginning would be as follows (<EM>n</EM>
being = 7):
<P>
<CENTER>{7(×), 2(×), ÷}, or {9(×), ÷}. </CENTER>
<P>This example is introduced merely to show that we may, if we please, retain
separately and permanently any <EM>intermediate</EM> results (like
<EM>ax<SUP>n</SUP></EM>, <EM>bpy</EM>) which occur in the course of processes
having an ulterior and more complicated result as their chief and final object
<FONT size=+4>(</FONT>like <IMG align=absBottom height=34
src="images/noteb5.gif" width=30><FONT
size=+4>)</FONT>.
<P>Any group of columns may be considered as representing a <EM>general</EM>
function, until a <EM>special</EM> one has been implicitly impressed upon them
through the introduction into the engine of the Operation and Variable-cards
made out for a <EM>particular</EM> function. Thus, in the preceding example,
V<SUB>1</SUB>, V<SUB>2</SUB>, V<SUB>3</SUB>, V<SUB>5</SUB>, V<SUB>6</SUB>,
V<SUB>7</SUB> represent the <EM>general</EM> function <IMG align=textTop alt=Phi
height=19 src="images/phi.gif" width=11>(<EM>a</EM>,
<EM>n</EM>, <EM>b</EM>, <EM>p</EM>, <EM>x</EM>, <EM>y</EM>) until the function
<IMG align=middle height=34 src="images/noteb5.gif"
width=30> has been determined on, and <EM>implicitly</EM> expressed by the
placing of the right cards in the engine. The actual working of the mechanism,
as regulated by these cards, then <EM>explicitly</EM> developes the value of the
function. The inscription of a function under the brackets, and in the square
under the result-column, in no way influences the processes or the results, and
is merely a memorandum for the observer, to remind him of what is going on. It
is the Operation and the Variable-cards only which in reality determine the
function. Indeed it should be distinctly kept in mind, that the inscriptions
within <EM>any</EM> of the squares are quite independent of the mechanism or
workings of the engine, and are nothing but arbitrary memorandums placed there
at pleasure to assist the spectator.
<P>The further we analyse the manner in which such an engine performs its
processes and attains its results, the more we perceive how distinctly it places
in a true and just light the mutual relations and connexion of the various steps
of mathematical analysis; how clearly it separates those things which are in
reality distinct and independent, and unites those which are mutually dependent.

<H3><EM><A name=NoteC>Note C</A></EM></H3></CENTER>Those who may desire to study
the principles of the Jacquard-loom in the most effectual manner, viz. that of
practical observation, have only to step into the Adelaide Gallery or the
Polytechnic Institution. In each of these valuable repositories of scientific
<EM>illustration</EM>, a weaver is constantly working at a Jacquard-loom, and is
ready to give any information that may be desired as to the construction and
modes of acting of his apparatus. The volume on the manufacture of silk, in
Lardner's Cyclopædia, contains a chapter on the Jacquard-loom, which may also be
consulted with advantage.
<P>The mode of application of the cards, as hitherto used in the art of weaving,
was not found, however, to be sufficiently powerful for all the simplifications
which it was desirable to attain in such varied and complicated processes as
those required in order to fulfil the purposes of an Analytical Engine. A method
was devised of what was technically designated <EM>backing</EM> the cards in
certain groups according to certain laws. The object of this extension is to
secure the possibility of bringing any particular card or set of cards into use
<EM>any number of times successively</EM> in the solution of one problem.
Whether this power shall be taken advantage of or not, in each particular
instance, will depend on the nature of the operations which the problem under
consideration may require. The process is <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#menaref2">alluded to by M.
Menabrea</A>, and it is a very important simplification. It has been proposed to
use it for the reciprocal benefit of that art, which, while it has itself no
apparent connexion with the domains of abstract science, has yet proved so
valuable to the latter, in suggesting the principles which, in their new and
singular field of application, seem likely to place <EM>algebraical</EM>
combinations not less completely within the province of mechanism, than are all
those varied intricacies of which <EM>intersecting threads</EM> are susceptible.
By the introduction of the system of <EM>backing</EM> into the Jacquard-loom
itself, patterns which should possess symmetry, and follow regular laws of any
extent, might be woven by means of comparatively few cards.
<P>Those who understand the mechanism of this loom will perceive that the above
improvement is easily effected in practice, by causing the prism over which the
train of pattern-cards is suspended to revolve <EM>backwards</EM> instead of
<EM>forwards</EM>, at pleasure, under the requisite circumstances; until, by so
doing, any particular card, or set of cards, that has done duty once, and passed
on in the ordinary regular succession, is brought back to the position it
occupied just before it was used the preceding time. The prism then resumes its
<EM>forward</EM> rotation, and thus brings the card or set of cards in question
into play a second time. This process may obviously be repeated any number of
times.

<P>In all calculations, the columns of Variables used may be divided into three
classes:--
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;1st. Those on which the data are inscribed:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;2ndly.
Those intended to receive the final results:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;3rdly. Those
intended to receive such intermediate and temporary combinations of the
primitive data as are not to be permanently retained, but are merely needed for
<EM>working with</EM>, in order to attain the ultimate results. Combinations of
this kind might properly be called <EM>secondary data</EM>. They are in fact so
many <EM>successive stages</EM> towards the final result. The columns which
receive them are rightly named <EM>Working-Variables</EM>, for their office is
in its nature purely <EM>subsidiary</EM> to other purposes. They develope an
intermediate and transient class of results, which unite the original data with
the final results.
<P>The Result-Variables sometimes partake of the nature of Working-Variables. It
frequently happens that a Variable destined to receive a final result is the
recipient of one or more intermediate values successively, in the course of the
processes. Similarly, the Variables for data often become Working-Variables, or
Result-Variables, or even both in succession. It so happens, however, that in
the case of the present equations the three sets of offices remain throughout
perfectly separate and independent.
<P>It will be observed, that in the squares below the <EM>Working</EM>-Variables
nothing is inscribed. Any one of these Variables is in many cases destined to
pass through various values successively during the performance of a calculation
(although in these particular equations no instance of this occurs) .
Consequently no <EM>one fixed</EM> symbol, or combination of symbols, should be
considered as properly belonging to a merely <EM>Working</EM>-Variable; and as a
general rule their squares are left blank. Of course in this, as in all other
cases where we mention a <EM>general</EM> rule, it is understood that many
particular exceptions may be expedient.
<P>In order that all the indications contained in the diagram may be completely
understood, we shall now explain two or three points, not hitherto touched on.
When the value on any Variable is called into use, one of two consequences may
be made to result. Either the value may <EM>return</EM> to the Variable after it
has been used, in which case it is ready for a second use if needed; or the
Variable may be made zero. (We are of course not considering a third case, of
not unfrequent occurrence, in which the same Variable is destined to receive the
<EM>result</EM> of the very operation which it has just supplied with a number.)
Now the ordinary rule is, that the value <EM>returns</EM> to the Variable;
unless it has been foreseen that no use for that value can recur, in which case
zero is substituted. At the <EM>end</EM> of a calculation, therefore, every
column ought as a general rule to be zero, excepting those for results. Thus it
will be seen by the diagram, that when <EM>m</EM>, the value on V<SUB>0</SUB>,
is used for the second time by Operation 5, V<SUB>0</SUB> becomes 0, since
<EM>m</EM> is not again needed; that similarly, when (<EM>mn'</EM> -
<EM>m'n</EM>), on V<SUB>12</SUB>, is used for the third time by Operation 11,
V<SUB>12</SUB> becomes zero, since (<EM>mn'</EM> - <EM>m'n</EM>) is not again
needed. In order to provide for the one or the other of the courses above
indicated, there are <EM>two</EM> varieties of the <EM>Supplying</EM>
Variable-cards. One of these varieties has provisions which cause the number
given off from any Variable to <EM>return</EM> to that Variable after doing its
duty in the mill. The other variety has provisions which cause <EM>zero</EM> to
be substituted on the Variable, for the number given off. These two varieties
are distinguished, when needful, by the respective appellations of the
<EM>Retaining</EM> Supply-cards and the <EM>Zero</EM> Supply-cards. We see that
the primary office (see <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteB">Note B</A>.) of both
these varieties of cards is the same; they only differ in their
<EM>secondary</EM> office.
<P>Every Variable thus has belonging to it one class of <EM>Receiving</EM>
Variable-cards and <EM>two</EM> classes of <EM>Supplying</EM> Variable-cards. It
is plain however that only the <EM>one</EM> or the <EM>other</EM> of these two
latter classes can be used by any one Variable for one operation; never
<EM>both</EM> simultaneously, their respective functions being mutually
incompatible.
<P>It should be understood that the Variable-cards are not placed in
<EM>immediate contiguity</EM> with the columns. Each card is connected by means
of wires with the column it is intended to act upon.
<P>Our diagram ought in reality to be placed side by side with M. Menabrea's
corresponding table, so as to be compared with it, line for line belonging to
each operation. But it was unfortunately inconvenient to print them in this
desirable form. The diagram is, in the main, merely another manner of indicating
the various relations denoted in M. Menabrea's table. Each mode has some
advantages and some disadvantages. Combined, they form a complete and accurate
method of registering every step and sequence in all calculations performed by
the engine.
<P>No notice has yet been taken of the <EM>upper</EM> indices which are added to
the left of each V in the diagram; an addition which we have also taken the
liberty of making to the V's in M. Menabrea's tables <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#menaref3">3</A> and <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#menaref4">4</A>, since it does
not <EM>alter</EM> anything therein represented by him, but merely <EM>adds</EM>
something to the previous indications of those tables. The <EM>lower</EM>
indices are obviously indices of <EM>locality</EM> only, and are wholly
independent of the operations performed or of the results obtained, their value
continuing unchanged during the performance of calculations. The <EM>upper</EM>
indices, however, are of a different nature. Their office is to indicate any
<EM>alteration</EM> in the value which a Variable represents; and they are of
course liable to changes during the processes of a calculation. Whenever a
Variable has only zeros upon it, it is called <SUP>0</SUP>V; the moment a value
appears on it (whether that value be placed there arbitrarily, or appears in the
natural course of a calculation), it becomes <SUP>1</SUP>V. If this value gives
place to another value, the Variable becomes <SUP>2</SUP>V, and so forth.
Whenever a <EM>value</EM> again gives place to <EM>zero</EM>, the Variable again
becomes <SUP>0</SUP>V, even if it have been <SUP>n</SUP>V the moment before. If
a <EM>value</EM> then again be substituted, the Variable becomes <SUP>n+1</SUP>V
(as it would have done if it had not passed through the intermediate
<SUP>0</SUP>V); &amp;c. &amp;c. Just before any calculation is commenced, and
after the data have been given, and everything adjusted and prepared for setting
the mechanism in action, the upper indices of the Variables for data are all
unity, and those for the Working and Result-variables are all zero. In this
state the diagram <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note16"
name=BKnote16>represents them</A>.
<P>There are several advantages in having a set of indices of this nature; but
these advantages are perhaps hardly of a kind to be immediately perceived,
unless by a mind somewhat accustomed to trace the successive steps by means of
which the engine accomplishes its purposes. We have only space to mention in a
general way, that the whole notation of the tables is made more consistent by
these indices, for they are able to mark a <EM>difference</EM> in certain cases,
where there would otherwise be an apparent <EM>identity</EM> confusing in its
tendency. In such a case as
V<SUB><EM>n</EM></SUB>=V<SUB><EM>p</EM></SUB>+V<SUB><EM>n</EM></SUB> there is
more clearness and more consistency with the usual laws of algebraical notation,
in being able to write
<SUP><EM>m+1</EM></SUP>V<SUB><EM>n</EM></SUB>=<SUP><EM>q</EM></SUP>V<SUB><EM>p</EM></SUB>+<SUP><EM>m</EM></SUP>V<SUB><EM>n</EM></SUB>.
It is also obvious that the indices furnish a powerful means of tracing back the
derivation of any result; and of registering various circumstances concerning
that <EM>series of successive substitutions</EM>, of which every <EM>result</EM>
is in fact merely the final consequence; circumstances that may in certain cases
involve relations which it is important to observe, either for purely analytical
reasons, or for practically adapting the workings of the engine to their
occurrence. The series of substitutions which lead to the equations of the
diagram are as follow:--

<P>There are <EM>three</EM> successive substitutions for each of these
equations. The formulæ (2.), (3.) and (4.) are <EM>implicitly</EM> contained in
(1.), which latter we may consider as being in fact the <EM>condensed</EM>
expression of any of the former. It will be observed that every succeeding
substitution must contain <EM>twice</EM> as many V's as its predecessor. So that
if a problem require <EM>n</EM> substitutions, the successive series of numbers
for the V's in the whole of them will be 2, 4, 8, 16...2<SUP>n</SUP>.
<P>The substitutions in the preceding equations happen to be of little value
towards illustrating the power and uses of the upper indices, for, owing to the
nature of these particular equations, the indices are all unity throughout. We
wish we had space to enter more fully into the relations which these indices
would in many cases enable us to trace.
<P>M. Menabrea incloses the three centre columns of his table under the general
title <EM>Variable-cards</EM>. The V's however in reality all represent the
actual <EM>Variable-columns</EM> of the engine, and not the cards that belong to
them. Still the title is a very just one, since it is through the special action
of certain Variable-cards (when <EM>combined</EM> with the more generalized
agency of the Operation-cards) that every one of the particular relations he has
indicated under that title is brought about.
<P>Suppose we wish to ascertain how often any <EM>one</EM> quantity, or
combination of quantities, is brought into use during a calculation. We easily
ascertain <EM>this</EM>, from the inspection of any vertical column or columns
of the diagram in which that quantity may appear. Thus, in the present case, we
see that all the data, and all the intermediate results likewise, are used
twice, excepting (<EM>mn'</EM> - <EM>m'n</EM>), which is used three times.
<P>The <EM>order</EM> in which it is possible to perform the operations for the
present example, enables us to effect all the eleven operations of which it
consists with only <EM>three Operation cards</EM>; because the problem is of
such a nature that it admits of each <EM>class</EM> of operations being
performed in a group together; all the multiplications one after another, all
the subtractions one after another, &amp;c. The operations are {6(×), 3(-),
2(÷)}.
<P>Since the very definition of an operation implies that there must be
<EM>two</EM> numbers to act upon, there are of course <EM>two Supplying</EM>
Variable-cards necessarily brought into action for every operation, in order to
furnish the two proper numbers. (See <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteB">Note B</A>.) Also,
since every operation must produce a <EM>result</EM>, which must be placed
<EM>somewhere</EM>, each operation entails the action of a <EM>Receiving</EM>
Variable-card, to indicate the proper locality for the result. Therefore, at
least three times as many Variable-cards as there are <EM>operations</EM> (not
<EM>Operation-cards</EM>, for these, as we have just seen, are by no means
always as numerous as the <EM>operations</EM>) are brought into use in every
calculation. Indeed, under certain contingencies, a still larger proportion is
requisite; such, for example, would probably be the case when the same result
has to appear on more than one Variable simultaneously (which is not
unfrequently a provision necessary for subsequent purposes in a calculation),
and in some other cases which we shall not here specify. We see therefore that a
great disproportion exists between the amount of <EM>Variable</EM> and of
<EM>Operation</EM>-cards requisite for the working of even the simplest
calculation.
<P><EM>All</EM> calculations do not admit, like this one, of the operations of
the same nature being performed in groups together. Probably very few do so
without exceptions occurring in one or other stage of the progress; and some
would not admit it at all. The <EM>order</EM> in which the operations shall be
performed in every particular case is a very interesting and curious question,
on which our space does not permit us fully to enter. In almost every
computation a great <EM>variety</EM> of arrangements for the succession of the
processes is possible, and various considerations must influence the selection
amongst them for the purposes of a Calculating Engine. One essential object is
to choose that arrangement which shall tend to reduce to a minimum the
<EM>time</EM> necessary for completing the calculation.
<P>It must be evident how multifarious and how mutually complicated are the
considerations which the working of such an engine involve. There are frequently
several distinct <EM>sets of effects</EM> going on simultaneously; all in a
manner independent of each other, and yet to a greater or less degree exercising
a mutual influence. To adjust each to every other, and indeed even to perceive
and trace them out with perfect correctness and success, entails difficulties
whose nature partakes to a certain extent of those involved in every question
where <EM>conditions</EM> are very numerous and inter-complicated; such as for
instance the estimation of the mutual relations amongst <EM>statistical</EM>
phænomena, and of those involved in many other classes of facts.

<H3><EM><A name=NoteE>Note E</A></EM></H3></CENTER>This example has evidently
been chosen on account of its brevity and simplicity, with a view merely to
explain the <EM>manner</EM> in which the engine would proceed in the case of an
<EM>analytical calculation containing variables</EM>, rather than to illustrate

<P>This trigonometrical series is not only in itself very appropriate for
illustrating the processes of the engine, but is likewise of much practical
interest from its frequent use in astronomical computations. Before proceeding
further with it, we shall point out that there are three very distinct classes
of ways in which it may be desired to deduce numerical values from any
analytical formula.
<P>First. We may wish to find the collective numerical value of the <EM>whole
formula</EM>, without any reference to the quantities of which that formula is a
function, or to the particular mode of their combination and distribution, of
which the formula is the result and representative. Values of this kind are of a
strictly arithmetical nature in the most limited sense of the term, and retain
no trace whatever of the processes through which they have been deduced. In
fact, any one such numerical value may have been attained from an <EM>infinite
variety</EM> of data, or of problems. The values for <EM>x</EM> and <EM>y</EM>
in the two equations (see <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteD">Note D</A>.) come under
this class of numerical results.
<P>Secondly. We may propose to compute the collective numerical value of
<EM>each term</EM> of a formula, or of a series, and to keep these results
separate. The engine must in such a case appropriate as many columns to
<EM>results</EM> as there are terms to compute.
<P>Thirdly. It may be desired to compute the numerical value of various
<EM>subdivisions of each term</EM>, and to keep all these results separate. It
may be required, for instance, to compute each coefficient separately from its
variable, in which particular case the engine must appropriate <EM>two</EM>
result-columns to <EM>every term that contains both a variable and
coefficient</EM>.
<P>There are many ways in which it may be desired in special cases to distribute
and keep separate the numerical values of different parts of an algebraical
formula; and the power of effecting such distributions to any extent is
essential to the <EM>algebraical</EM> character of the Analytical Engine. Many
persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies, imagine that because
the business of the engine is to give its results in <EM>numerical
notation</EM>, the <EM>nature of its processes</EM> must consequently be
<EM>arithmetical</EM> and <EM>numerical</EM>, rather than <EM>algebraical</EM>
and <EM>analytical</EM>. This is an error. The engine can arrange and combine
its numerical quantities exactly as if they were <EM>letters</EM> or any other
<EM>general</EM> symbols; and in fact it might bring out its results in
algebraical <EM>notation</EM>, were provisions made accordingly. It might
develope three sets of results simultaneously, viz. <EM>symbolic</EM> results
(as already alluded to in Notes <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteA">A</A>. and <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteB">B</A>.),
<EM>numerical</EM> results (its chief and primary object); and
<EM>algebraical</EM> results in <EM>literal</EM> notation. This latter however
has not been deemed a necessary or desirable addition to its powers, partly
because the necessary arrangements for effecting it would increase the
complexity and extent of the mechanism to a degree that would not be
commensurate with the advantages, where the main object of the invention is to
translate into <EM>numerical</EM> language general formulæ of analysis already
known to us, or whose laws of formation are known to us. But it would be a
mistake to suppose that because its <EM>results</EM> are given in the
<EM>notation</EM> of a more restricted science, its <EM>processes</EM> are
therefore restricted to those of that science. The object of the engine is in
fact to give the <EM>utmost practical efficiency</EM> to the resources of
<EM>numerical interpretations</EM> of the higher science of analysis, while it
uses the processes and combinations of this latter.
<P>To return to the trigonometrical series. We shall only consider the first
four terms of the factor (A + A<SUB>1</SUB> cos <IMG alt=theta height=16
src="images/theta.gif" width=9> + &amp;c.), since
this will be sufficient to show the method. We propose to obtain separately the
numerical value of <EM>each coefficient</EM> C<SUB>0</SUB>, C<SUB>1</SUB>,
&amp;c. of (1.). The direct multiplication of the two factors gives

effect this transformation, each successive coefficient upon V<SUB>32</SUB>,
V<SUB>33</SUB>, &amp;c. (beginning with V<SUB>32</SUB>), must through means of

the other half to the coefficient on the Variable which precedes it by twelve

<P>The calculation of the coefficients C<SUB>0</SUB>, C<SUB>1</SUB>, &amp;c. of
(1.) would now be completed, and they would stand ranged in order on
V<SUB>20</SUB>, V<SUB>21</SUB>, &amp;c. It will be remarked, that from the
moment the fourth series of operations is ordered, the Variables V<SUB>31</SUB>,
V<SUB>32</SUB>, &amp;c. cease to be <EM>Result</EM>-Variables, and become mere
<EM>Working</EM>-Variables.
<P>The substitution made by the engine of the processes in the second side of
(3.) for those in the first side is an excellent illustration of the manner in
which we may arbitrarily order it to substitute any function, number, or
process, at pleasure, for any other function, number or process, on the
occurrence of a specified contingency.
<P>We will now suppose that we desire to go a step further, and to obtain the
numerical value of each <EM>complete</EM> term of the product (1.); that is, of
each <EM>coefficient and variable united</EM>, which for the (<EM>n</EM> + 1)th
term would be <IMG align=absMiddle alt="${\rm C}_n\cdot\cos n\theta$" height=15
src="images/adaeq21.gif" width=81>.
<P>We must for this purpose place the variables themselves on another set of
columns, V<SUB>41</SUB>, V<SUB>42</SUB>, &amp;c., and then order their
successive multiplication by V<SUB>21</SUB>, V<SUB>22</SUB>, &amp;c., each for

(=1) inscribed on it, preparatory to commencing the fifth series of operations.)

<P>From the moment that the fifth and final series of operations is ordered, the
Variables V<SUB>20</SUB>, V<SUB>21</SUB>, &amp;c. then in their turn cease to be
<EM>Result</EM>-Variables and become mere <EM>Working</EM>-Variables;
V<SUB>40</SUB>, V<SUB>41</SUB>, &amp;c. being now the recipients of the ultimate

&amp;c. are furnished, they would be placed directly upon V<SUB>41</SUB>,
V<SUB>42</SUB>, &amp;c., like any other data. If not, a separate computation
might be entered upon in a separate part of the engine, in order to calculate
them, and place them on V<SUB>41</SUB>, &amp;c.
<P>We have now explained how the engine might compute (1.) in the most direct
manner, supposing we knew nothing about the <EM>general</EM> term of the
resulting series. But the engine would in reality set to work very differently,
whenever (as in this case) we <EM>do</EM> know the law for the general term.
<P>The first two terms of (1.) are

<P>which is the coefficient of the (<EM>n</EM>+1)th term. The engine would
calculate the first two terms by means of a separate set of suitable
Operation-cards, and would then need another set for the third term; which last
set of Operation-cards would calculate all the succeeding terms <EM>ad
infinitum</EM>, merely requiring certain new Variable-cards for each term to
direct the operations to act on the proper columns. The following would be the
successive sets of operations for computing the coefficients of <EM>n</EM>+2
terms:--
<P>
<CENTER>(×, ×, ÷, +), (×, ×, ×, ÷, +, +), <EM>n</EM>(×, +, ×, ÷, +). </CENTER>
<P>Or we might represent them as follows, according to the numerical order of
the operations:--
<P>
<CENTER>(1, 2...4), (5, 6...10), <EM>n</EM>(11, 12...15). </CENTER>
<P>The brackets, it should be understood, point out the relation in which the
operations may be <EM>grouped</EM>, while the comma marks <EM>succession</EM>.
The symbol + might be used for this latter purpose, but this would be liable to
produce confusion, as + is also necessarily used to represent one class of the
actual operations which are the subject of that succession. In accordance with
this meaning attached to the comma, care must be taken when any one group of
operations recurs more than once, as is represented above by
<EM>n</EM>(11...l5), not to insert a comma after the number or letter prefixed
to that group. <EM>n</EM>, (11...15) would stand for <EM>an operation n,
followed by the group of operations</EM> (11...15); instead of denoting <EM>the
number of groups which are to follow each other</EM>.
<P>Wherever a <EM>general</EM> term exists, there will be a <EM>recurring
group</EM> of operations, as in the above example. Both for brevity and for
distinctness, a <EM>recurring group</EM> is called a <EM>cycle</EM>. A
<EM>cycle</EM> of operations, then, must be understood to signify any <EM>set of
operations</EM> which is repeated <EM>more than once</EM>. It is equally a
<EM>cycle</EM>, whether it be repeated <EM>twice</EM> only, or an indefinite
number of times; for it is the fact of a <EM>repetition occurring at all</EM>
that constitutes it such. In many cases of analysis there is a <EM>recurring
group</EM> of one or more <EM>cycles</EM>; that is, a <EM>cycle of a cycle</EM>,
or a <EM>cycle of cycles</EM>. For instance: suppose we wish to divide a series
by a series,

<P>it being required that the result shall be developed, like the dividend and
the divisor, in successive powers of <EM>x</EM>. A little consideration of (1.),
and of the steps through which algebraical division is effected, will show that
(if the denominator be supposed to consist of <EM>p</EM> terms) the first

<P>that the second partial quotient will be completed by an exactly similar set
of operations, which acts on the remainder obtained by the first set, instead of
on the original dividend. The whole of the processes therefore that have been
gone through, by the time the <EM>second</EM> partial quotient has been
obtained, will be,--

<P>which is a cycle that includes a cycle, or a cycle of the second order. The
operations for the <EM>complete</EM> division, supposing we propose to obtain

</TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>It is of course to be remembered that the process of algebraical division in
reality continues <EM>ad infinitum</EM>, except in the few exceptional cases
which admit of an exact quotient being obtained. The number <EM>n</EM> in the
formula (4.) is always that of the number of terms we propose to ourselves to
obtain; and the <EM>n</EM>th partial quotient is the coefficient of the
(<EM>n</EM>-1)th power of <EM>x</EM>.
<P>There are some cases which entail <EM>cycles of cycles of cycles</EM>, to an
indefinite extent. Such cases are usually very complicated, and they are of
extreme interest when considered with reference to the engine. The algebraical
development in a series of the <EM>n</EM>th function of any given function is of
this nature. Let it be proposed to obtain the <EM>n</EM>th function of

  </TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>We should premise, that we suppose the reader to understand what is meant by
an <EM>n</EM>th function. We suppose him likewise to comprehend distinctly the
difference between developing <EM>an n</EM>th <EM>function algebraically</EM>,
and merely <EM>calculating an n</EM>th <EM>function arithmetically</EM>. If he
does not, the following will be by no means very intelligible; but we have not
space to give any preliminary explanations. To proceed: the law, according to
which the successive functions of (5.) are to be developed, must of course first
be fixed on. This law may be of very various kinds. We may propose to obtain our
results in successive <EM>powers</EM> of <EM>x</EM>, in which case the general
form would be
<P>
<CENTER>C + C<SUB>1</SUB><EM>x</EM> + C<SUB>2</SUB><EM>x</EM><SUP>2</SUP> +
&amp;c.; </CENTER>
<P>or in successive powers of <EM>n</EM> itself, the index of the function we
are ultimately to obtain, in which case the general form would be
<P>
<CENTER>C + C<SUB>1</SUB><EM>n</EM> + C<SUB>2</SUB><EM>n</EM><SUP>2</SUP> +
&amp;c.; </CENTER>
<P>and <EM>x</EM> would only enter in the coefficients. Again, other functions
of <EM>x</EM> or of <EM>n</EM> instead of <EM>powers</EM> might be selected. It
might be in addition proposed, that the coefficients themselves should be
arranged according to given functions of a certain quantity. Another mode would
be to make equations arbitrarily amongst the coefficients only, in which case
the several functions, according to either of which it might be possible to
develope the <EM>n</EM>th function of (5.), would have to be determined from the
combined consideration of these equations and of (5.) itself.
<P>The <EM>algebraical</EM> nature of the engine (so strongly insisted on in a
previous part of this Note) would enable it to follow out any of these various
modes indifferently; just as we recently showed that it can distribute and
separate the numerical results of any one prescribed series of processes, in a
perfectly arbitrary manner. Were it otherwise, the engine could merely
<EM>compute the arithmetical n</EM>th <EM>function</EM>, a result which, like
any other purely arithmetical results, would be simply a collective number,
bearing no traces of the data or the processes which had led to it.
<P>Secondly, the <EM>law</EM> of development for the <EM>n</EM>th function being
selected, the next step would obviously be to develope (5.) itself, according to
this law. This result would be the first function, and would be obtained by a
determinate series of processes. These in most cases would include amongst them
one or more <EM>cycles</EM> of operations.
<P>The third step (which would consist of the various processes necessary for
effecting the actual substitution of the series constituting the <EM>first
function</EM>, for the <EM>variable</EM> itself) might proceed in either of two
ways. It might make the substitution either wherever <EM>x</EM> occurs in the
original (5.), or it might similarly make it wherever <EM>x</EM> occurs in the
first function itself which is the equivalent of (5.). In some cases the former
mode might be best, and in others the latter.
<P>Whichever is adopted, it must be understood that the result is to appear
arranged in a series following the law originally prescribed for the development
of the <EM>n</EM>th function. This result constitutes the second function; with
which we are to proceed exactly as we did with the first function, in order to
obtain the third function, and so on, <EM>n</EM>-1 times, to obtain the
<EM>n</EM>th function. We easily perceive that since every successive function
is arranged in a series <EM>following the same law</EM>, there would (after the
<EM>first</EM> function is obtained) be a <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note19"
name=BKnote19><EM>cycle of a cycle of a cycle</EM>, &amp;c. of operations</A>,
one, two, three, up to <EM>n</EM>-1 times, in order to get the <EM>n</EM>th
function. We say, <EM>after the first function is obtained</EM>, because (for
reasons on which we cannot here enter) the <EM>first</EM> function might in many
cases be developed through a set of processes peculiar to itself, and not
recurring for the remaining functions.
<P>We have given but a very slight sketch of the principal <EM>general</EM>
steps which would be requisite for obtaining an <EM>n</EM>th function of such a
formula as (5.). The question is so exceedingly complicated, that perhaps few
persons can be expected to follow, to their own satisfaction, so brief and
general a statement as we are here restricted to on this subject. Still it is a
very important case as regards the engine, and suggests ideas peculiar to
itself, which we should regret to pass wholly without allusion. Nothing could be
more interesting than to follow out, in every detail, the solution by the engine
of such a case as the above; but the time, space and labour this would
necessitate, could only suit a very extensive work.
<P>To return to the subject of <EM>cycles</EM> of operations: some of the
notation of the integral calculus lends itself very aptly to express them: (2.)
might be thus written:--
<P>
<TABLE>

limits are from 1 to <EM>p</EM>, or from 0 to <EM>p</EM>-1, each increment being
equal to unity. Similarly, (4.) would be,--
<P>
<TABLE>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD align=right width="1%">(7.)
    <TD align=middle width="99%"><IMG height=23
      src="images/adaeq12.gif" width=287>

    <TD align=middle width="99%">or&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG align=absMiddle height=23
      src="images/adaeq13.gif" width=274>
</TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Perhaps it may be thought that this notation is merely a circuitous way of
expressing what was more simply and as effectually expressed before; and, in the
above example, there may be some truth in this. But there is another description
of cycles which <EM>can</EM> only effectually be expressed, in a condensed form,
by the preceding notation. We shall call them <EM>varying cycles</EM>. They are
of frequent occurrence, and include successive cycles of operations of the
following nature:--
<P>
<TABLE>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD align=right width="1%">(9.)
    <TD align=middle width="99%"><IMG height=24
      src="images/adaeq14.gif" width=644>
</TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>where each cycle contains the same group of operations, but in which the
number of repetitions of the group varies according to a fixed rate, with every
cycle. (9.) can be well expressed as follows:--
<P>
<TABLE>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD align=right width="1%">(10.)
    <TD align=middle width="99%"><IMG align=absMiddle height=23
      src="images/adaeq15.gif" width=139>, the limits
      of <EM>p</EM> being from <EM>p</EM>-<EM>n</EM> to <EM>p</EM>.
</TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Independent of the intrinsic advantages which we thus perceive to result in
certain cases from this use of the notation of the integral calculus, there are
likewise considerations which make it interesting, from the connections and
relations involved in this new application. It has been observed in some of the
former Notes, that the processes used in analysis form a logical system of much
higher generality than the applications to number merely. Thus, when we read
over any algebraical formula, considering it exclusively with reference to the
processes of the engine, and putting aside for the moment its abstract
signification as to the relations of quantity, the symbols +, ×, &amp;c. in
reality represent (as their immediate and proximate effect, when the formula is
applied to the engine) that a certain prism which is a part of the mechanism
(see <A href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteC">Note C</A>.)
turns a new face, and thus presents a new card to act on the bundles of levers
of the engine; the new card being perforated with holes, which are arranged
according to the peculiarities of the operation of addition, or of
multiplication, &amp;c. Again, the <EM>numbers</EM> in the preceding formula
(8.), each of them really represents one of these very pieces of card that are
hung over the prism.
<P>Now in the use made in the formulæ (7.), (8.) and (10.), of the notation of
the integral calculus, we have glimpses of a similar new application of the
language of the <EM>higher</EM> mathematics. <IMG align=absMiddle alt=Sigma
height=15 src="images/sigma.gif" width=13>, in
reality, here indicates that when a certain number of cards have acted in
succession, the prism over which they revolve must <EM>rotate backwards</EM>, so
as to bring those cards into their former position; and the limits 1 to
<EM>n</EM>, 1 to <EM>p</EM>, &amp;c., regulate how often this backward rotation
is to be repeated.
<P align=right>A. A. L. </P>
<CENTER>
<H3><EM><A name=NoteF>Note F</A></EM></H3></CENTER>There is in existence a
beautiful woven portrait of Jacquard, in the fabrication of which 24,000 cards
were required.
<P>The power of <EM>repeating</EM> the cards, <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#menaref2">alluded to</A> by M.
Menabrea, and more fully explained in <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteC">Note C</A>., reduces to
an immense extent the number of cards required. It is obvious that this
mechanical improvement is especially applicable wherever <EM>cycles</EM> occur
in the mathematical operations, and that, in preparing data for calculations by
the engine, it is desirable to arrange the order and combination of the
processes with a view to obtain them as much as possible <EM>symmetrically</EM>
and in cycles, in order that the mechanical advantages of the <EM>backing</EM>
system may be applied to the utmost. It is here interesting to observe the
manner in which the value of an <EM>analytical</EM> resource is <EM>met</EM> and
<EM>enhanced</EM> by an ingenious <EM>mechanical</EM> contrivance. We see in it
an instance of one of those mutual <EM>adjustments</EM> between the purely
mathematical and the mechanical departments, mentioned in <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteA">Note A</A>. as being a
main and essential condition of success in the invention of a calculating
engine. The nature of the resources afforded by such adjustments would be of two
principal kinds. In some cases, a difficulty (perhaps in itself insurmountable)
in the one department would be overcome by facilities in the other; and
sometimes (as in the present case) a strong point in the one would be rendered
still stronger and more available by combination with a corresponding strong
point in the other.
<P>As a mere example of the degree to which the combined systems of cycles and
of backing can diminish the <EM>number</EM> of cards requisite, we shall choose
a case which places it in strong evidence, and which has likewise the advantage
of being a perfectly different <EM>kind</EM> of problem from those that are
mentioned in any of the other Notes. Suppose it be required to eliminate nine
variables from ten simple equations of the form--

<P>We should explain, before proceeding, that it is not our object to consider
this problem with reference to the actual arrangement of the data on the
Variables of the engine, but simply as an abstract question of the
<EM>nature</EM> and <EM>number</EM> of the <EM>operations</EM> required to be
performed during its complete solution.
<P>The first step would be the elimination of the first unknown quantity
<EM>x</EM><SUB>0</SUB> between the first two equations. This would be obtained
by the form--
<P>
<CENTER>(<EM>a</EM><SUP>1</SUP><EM>a</EM>-<EM>a</EM><EM>a</EM><SUP>1</SUP>)<EM>x</EM><SUB>0</SUB>
+
(<EM>a</EM><SUP>1</SUP><EM>b</EM>-<EM>a</EM><EM>b</EM><SUP>1</SUP>)<EM>x</EM><SUB>1</SUB>

(<EM>a</EM><SUP>1</SUP><EM>c</EM>-<EM>a</EM><EM>c</EM><SUP>1</SUP>)<EM>x</EM><SUB>2</SUB>
+<BR>+
(<EM>a</EM><SUP>1</SUP><EM>d</EM>-<EM>a</EM><EM>d</EM><SUP>1</SUP>)<EM>x</EM><SUB>3</SUB>

<EM>a</EM><SUP>1</SUP><EM>p</EM>-<EM>a</EM><EM>p</EM><SUP>1</SUP>, </CENTER>
<P>for which the operations 10 (×, ×, -) would be needed. The second step would
be the elimination of <EM>x</EM><SUB>0</SUB> between the second and third
equations, for which the operations would be precisely the same. We should then
have had altogether the following operations:--
<P>
<CENTER>10(×, ×, -), 10(×, ×, -) = 20(×, ×, -) </CENTER>
<P>Continuing in the same manner, the total number of operations for the
complete elimination of <EM>x</EM><SUB>0</SUB> between all the successive pairs
of equations would be--
<P>
<CENTER>9 · 10(×, ×, -) = 90(×, ×, -) </CENTER>
<P>We should then be left with nine simple equations of nine variables from
which to eliminate the next variable <EM>x</EM><SUB>1</SUB>, for which the total
of the processes would be
<P>
<CENTER>8 · 9(×, ×, -) = 72(×, ×, -) </CENTER>
<P>We should then be left with eight simple equations of eight variables from
which to eliminate <EM>x</EM><SUB>2</SUB>, for which the processes would be--
<P>
<CENTER>7 · 8(×, ×, -) = 56(×, ×, -) </CENTER>
<P>and so on. The total operations for the elimination of all the variables
would thus be--
<P>
<CENTER>9·10 + 8·9 + 7·8 + 6·7 + 5·6 + 4·5 + 3·4 + 2·3 + 1·2 = 330. </CENTER>
<P>So that <EM>three</EM> Operation-cards would perform the office of 330 such
cards.
<P>If we take <EM>n</EM> simple equations containing <EM>n</EM>-1 variables,
<EM>n</EM> being a number unlimited in magnitude, the case becomes still more
obvious, as the same three cards might then take the place of thousands or
millions of cards.
<P>We shall now draw further attention to the fact, already noticed, of its
being by no means necessary that a formula proposed for solution should ever
have been actually worked out, as a condition for enabling the engine to solve
it. Provided we know the <EM>series of operations</EM> to be gone through, that
is sufficient. In the foregoing instance this will be obvious enough on a slight
consideration. And it is a circumstance which deserves particular notice, since
herein may reside a latent value of such an engine almost incalculable in its
possible ultimate results. We already know that there are functions whose
numerical value it is of importance for the purposes both of abstract and of
practical science to ascertain, but whose determination requires processes so
lengthy and so complicated, that, although it is possible to arrive at them
through great expenditure of time, labour and money, it is yet on these accounts
practically almost unattainable; and we can conceive there being some results
which it may be <EM>absolutely impossible</EM> in practice to attain with any
accuracy, and whose precise determination it may prove highly important for some
of the future wants of science, in its manifold, complicated and
rapidly-developing fields of inquiry, to arrive at.
<P>Without, however, stepping into the region of conjecture, we will mention a
particular problem which occurs to us at this moment as being an apt
illustration of the use to which such an engine may be turned for determining
that which human brains find it difficult or impossible to work out unerringly.
In the solution of the famous problem of the Three Bodies, there are, out of
about 295 coefficients of lunar perturbations given by M. Clausen
(Astro<SUP>e</SUP>. Nachrichten, No. 406) as the result of the calculations by
Burg, of two by Damoiseau, and of one by Burckhardt, fourteen coefficients that
differ in the nature of their algebraic sign; and out of the remainder there are
only 101 (or about one-third) that agree precisely both in signs and in amount.
These discordances, which are generally small in individual magnitude, may arise
either from an erroneous determination of the abstract coefficients in the
development of the problem, or from discrepancies in the data deduced from
observation, or from both causes combined. The former is the most ordinary
source of error in astronomical computations, and this the engine would entirely
obviate.
<P>We might even invent laws for series or formulæ in an arbitrary manner, and
set the engine to work upon them, and thus deduce numerical results which we
might not otherwise have thought of obtaining; but this would hardly perhaps in
any instance be productive of any great practical utility, or calculated to rank
higher than as a philosophical amusement.
<P align=right>A. A. L. </P>
<CENTER>
<H3><EM><A name=NoteG>Note G</A></EM></H3></CENTER>It is desirable to guard
against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers
of the Analytical Engine. In considering any new subject, there is frequently a
tendency, first, to <EM>overrate</EM> what we find to be already interesting or
remarkable; and, secondly, by a sort of natural reaction, to <EM>undervalue</EM>
the true state of the case, when we do discover that our notions have surpassed
those that were really tenable.
<P>The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to <EM>originate</EM>
anything. It can do whatever we <EM>know how to order it</EM> to perform. It can
<EM>follow</EM> analysis; but it has no power of <EM>anticipating</EM> any
analytical relations or truths. Its province is to assist us in making
<EM>available</EM> what we are already acquainted with. This it is calculated to
effect primarily and chiefly of course, through its executive faculties; but it
is likely to exert an <EM>indirect</EM> and reciprocal influence on science
itself in another manner. For, in so distributing and combining the truths and
the formulæ of analysis, that they may become most easily and rapidly amenable
to the mechanical combinations of the engine, the relations and the nature of
many subjects in that science are necessarily thrown into new lights, and more
profoundly investigated. This is a decidedly indirect, and a somewhat
<EM>speculative</EM>, consequence of such an invention. It is however pretty
evident, on general principles, that in devising for mathematical truths a new
form in which to record and throw themselves out for actual use, views are
likely to be induced, which should again react on the more theoretical phase of
the subject. There are in all extensions of human power, or additions to human
knowledge, various <EM>collateral</EM> influences, besides the main and primary
object attained.
<P>To return to the executive faculties of this engine: the question must arise
in every mind, are they <EM>really</EM> even able to <EM>follow</EM> analysis in
its whole extent? No reply, entirely satisfactory to all minds, can be given to
this query, excepting the actual existence of the engine, and actual experience
of its practical results. We will however sum up for each reader's consideration
the chief elements with which the engine works:--
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>It performs the four operations of simple arithmetic upon any numbers
  whatever.
  <P></P>
  <LI>By means of certain artifices and arrangements (upon which we cannot enter
  within the restricted space which such a publication as the present may admit
  of), there is no limit either to the <EM>magnitude</EM> of the
  <EM>numbers</EM> used, or to the <EM>number of quantities</EM> (either
  variables or constants) that may be employed.
  <P></P>
  <LI>It can combine these numbers and these quantities either algebraically or
  arithmetically, in relations unlimited as to variety, extent, or complexity.
  <P></P>
  <LI>It uses algebraic <EM>signs</EM> according to their proper laws, and
  developes the logical consequences of these laws.
  <P></P>
  <LI>It can arbitrarily substitute any formula for any other; effacing the
  first from the columns on which it is represented, and making the second
  appear in its stead.
  <P></P>
  <LI>It can provide for singular values. Its power of doing this is referred to
  in M. Menabrea's memoir, <A
  href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#menaref6">where he
  mentions</A> the passage of values through zero and infinity. The
  practicability of causing it arbitrarily to change its processes at any
  moment, on the occurrence of any specified contingency (of which its
  substitution of <IMG align=absMiddle height=22
  src="images/adaeq19.gif" width=216> for <IMG
  align=absMiddle height=17 src="images/adaeq20.gif"
  width=105>, explained in <A
  href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteE">Note E</A>., is in
  some degree an illustration), at once secures this point. </LI></OL>
<P>The subject of integration and of differentiation demands some notice. The
engine can effect these processes in either of two ways:--
<P>First. We may order it, by means of the Operation and of the Variable-cards,
to go through the various steps by which the required <EM>limit</EM> can be
worked out for whatever function is under consideration.
<P>Secondly. It may (if we know the form of the limit for the function in
question) effect the <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note20"
name=BKnote20>integration or differentiation by direct</A> substitution. We
remarked in <A href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteB">Note
B</A>., that any <EM>set</EM> of columns on which numbers are inscribed,
represents merely a <EM>general</EM> function of the several quantities, until
the special function have been impressed by means of the Operation and
Variable-cards. Consequently, if instead of requiring the value of the function,
we require that of its integral, or of its differential coefficient, we have
merely to order whatever particular combination of the ingredient quantities may
constitute that integral or that coefficient. In <EM>ax<SUP>n</SUP></EM>, for
instance, instead of the quantities
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=98 src="images/notegn4.gif"
width=245> </CENTER>
<P>being ordered to appear on V<SUB>3</SUB> in the combination
<EM>ax<SUP>n</SUP></EM>, they would be ordered to appear in that of
<P>
<CENTER><EM>anx</EM><SUP><EM>n</EM>-1</SUP> </CENTER>
<P>They would then stand thus:--
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=105 src="images/notegn3.gif"
width=282> </CENTER>
<P>Similarly, we might have <IMG align=absMiddle alt=(a/(n+1))*x^(n+1) height=23
src="images/adaeq23.gif" width=69>, the integral of
<EM>ax<SUP>n</SUP></EM>.
<P>An interesting example for following out the processes of the engine would be
such a form as
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=57 src="images/notegn2.gif"
width=132> </CENTER>
<P>or any other cases of integration by successive reductions, where an integral
which contains an operation repeated <EM>n</EM> times can be made to depend upon
another which contains the same <EM>n</EM>-1 or <EM>n</EM>-2 times, and so on
until by continued reduction we arrive at a certain <EM>ultimate</EM> form,
whose value has then to be determined.
<P>The methods in Arbogast's <EM>Calcul des Dérivations</EM> are peculiarly
fitted for the notation and the processes of the engine. Likewise the whole of
the Combinatorial Analysis, which consists first in a purely numerical
calculation of indices, and secondly in the distribution and combination of the
quantities according to laws prescribed by these indices.
<P>We will terminate these Notes by following up in detail the steps through
which the engine could compute the Numbers of Bernoulli, this being (in the form
in which we shall deduce it) a rather complicated example of its powers. The
simplest manner of computing these numbers would be from the direct expansion of

independently, <EM>n</EM> may be any whole number whatever; although when (7.)
occurs as <EM>one of the</EM> D's in (6.), it is obvious that <EM>n</EM> is then
not arbitrary, but is always a certain function of the <EM>distance of that</EM>
D <EM>from the beginning</EM>. If that distance be =<EM>d</EM>, then
<P>

<P>It is with the <EM>independent</EM> formula (8.) that we have to do.
Therefore it must be remembered that the conditions for the value of <EM>n</EM>
are now modified, and that <EM>n</EM> is a perfectly <EM>arbitrary</EM> whole
number. This circumstance, combined with the fact (which we may easily perceive)
that whatever <EM>n</EM> is, every term of (8.) after the (<EM>n</EM>+1)th is
=0, and that the (<EM>n</EM>+1)th term itself is always <IMG align=absMiddle
height=22 src="images/adaeq24.gif" width=167>,
enables us to find the value (either numerical or algebraical) of any
<EM>n</EM>th Number of Bernoulli B<SUB>2<EM>n</EM>-1</SUB>, <EM>in terms of all
the preceding ones</EM>, if we but know the values of B<SUB>1</SUB>,
B<SUB>3</SUB>...B<SUB>2<EM>n</EM>-3</SUB>. We append to this Note a Diagram and
Table, containing the details of the computation for B<SUB>7</SUB>
(B<SUB>1</SUB>, B<SUB>3</SUB>, B<SUB>5</SUB> being supposed given).
<P>On attentively considering (8.), we shall likewise perceive that we may
derive from it the numerical value of <EM>every</EM> Number of Bernoulli in
succession, from the very beginning, <EM>ad infinitum</EM>, by the following
series of computations:--
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;1st Series.--Let <EM>n</EM>=1, and calculate (8.) for this value
of <EM>n</EM>. The result is B<SUB>1</SUB>.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;2nd Series.--Let
<EM>n</EM>=2. Calculate (8.) for this value of <EM>n</EM>, substituting the
value of B<SUB>1</SUB> just obtained. The result is
B<SUB>3</SUB>.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;3rd Series.--Let <EM>n</EM>=3. Calculate (8.) for
this value of <EM>n</EM>, substituting the values of B<SUB>1</SUB>,
B<SUB>3</SUB> before obtained. The result is B<SUB>5</SUB>. And so on, to any
extent.

engine when just prepared for computing B<SUB>2<EM>n</EM>-1</SUB> (in the case
of <EM>n</EM>=4); while the table beneath them presents a complete simultaneous
view of all the successive changes which these columns then severally pass
through in order to perform the computation. (The reader is referred to <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteD">Note D</A>. for
explanations respecting the nature and notation of such tables.)
<P>Six numerical <EM>data</EM> are in this case necessary for making the
requisite combinations. These data are 1, 2, <EM>n</EM>(=4), B<SUB>1</SUB>,
B<SUB>3</SUB>, B<SUB>5</SUB>. Were <EM>n</EM>=5, the additional datum
B<SUB>5</SUB> would be needed. Were <EM>n</EM>=6, the datum B<SUB>9</SUB> would
be needed; and so on. Thus the actual <EM>number of data</EM> needed will always
be <EM>n</EM>+2, for <EM>n</EM>=<EM>n</EM>; and out of these <EM>n</EM>+2 data,
<IMG align=absMiddle height=19
src="images/adaeq25.gif" width=82> of them are
successive Numbers of Bernoulli. The reason why the Bernoulli Numbers used as
data are nevertheless placed on <EM>Result</EM>-columns in the diagram, is
because they may properly be supposed to have been previously computed in
succession by the <EM>engine</EM> itself; under which circumstances each B will
appear as a <EM>result</EM>, previous to being used as a <EM>datum</EM> for
computing the succeeding B. Here then is an instance (of the kind alluded to in
<A href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteD">Note D</A>.) of the
same Variables filling more than one office in turn. It is true that if we
consider our computation of B<SUB>7</SUB> as a perfectly isolated calculation,
we may conclude B<SUB>1</SUB>, B<SUB>3</SUB>, B<SUB>5</SUB> to have been
arbitrarily placed on the columns; and it would then perhaps be more consistent
to put them on V<SUB>4</SUB>, V<SUB>5</SUB>, V<SUB>6</SUB> as data and not
results. But we are not taking this view. On the contrary, we suppose the engine
to be <EM>in the course of</EM> computing the Numbers to an indefinite extent,
from the very beginning; and that we merely single out, by way of example,
<EM>one amongst</EM> the successive but distinct series of computations it is
thus performing. Where the B's are fractional, it must be understood that they
are computed and appear in the notation of <EM>decimal</EM> fractions. Indeed
this is a circumstance that should be noticed with reference to all
calculations. In any of the examples already given in the translation and in the
Notes, some of the <EM>data</EM>, or of the temporary or permanent results,
might be fractional, quite as probably as whole numbers. But the arrangements
are so made, that the nature of the processes would be the same as for whole
numbers.
<P>In the above table and diagram we are not considering the <EM>signs</EM> of
any of the B's, merely their numerical magnitude. The engine would bring out the
sign for each of them correctly of course, but we cannot enter on <EM>every</EM>
additional detail of this kind as we might wish to do. The circles for the signs
are therefore intentionally left blank in the diagram.
<P>Operation-cards 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 prepare <IMG align=absMiddle
alt=-½·((2n-1)/(2n+1)) height=25
src="images/adaeq17.gif" width=77>. Thus, Card 1
multiplies <EM>two</EM> into <EM>n</EM>, and the three <EM>Receiving</EM>
Variable-cards belonging respectively to V<SUB>4</SUB>, V<SUB>5</SUB>,
V<SUB>6</SUB>, allow the result 2<EM>n</EM> to be placed on each of these latter
columns (this being a case in which a triple receipt of the result is needed for
subsequent purposes); we see that the upper indices of the two Variables used,
during Operation 1, remain unaltered.
<P>We shall not go through the details of every operation singly, since the
table and diagram sufficiently indicate them; we shall merely notice some few
peculiar cases.
<P>By Operation 6, a <EM>positive</EM> quantity is turned into a
<EM>negative</EM> quantity, by simply subtracting the quantity from a column
which has only zero upon it. (The sign at the top of V<SUB>8</SUB> would become
- during this process.)
<P>Operation 7 will be unintelligible, unless it be remembered that if we were
calculating for <EM>n</EM> = 1 instead of n = 4, Operation 6 would have
completed the computation of B<SUB>1</SUB> itself, in which case the engine
instead of continuing its processes, would have to put B<SUB>1</SUB> on
V<SUB>21</SUB>; and then either to stop altogether, or to begin Operations 1,
2...7 all over again for value of <EM>n</EM>(=2), in order to enter on the
computation of B<SUB>3</SUB>; (having however taken care, previous to this
recommencement, to make the number on V<SUB>3</SUB> equal to <EM>two</EM>, by
the addition of unity to the former <EM>n</EM>=1 on that column). Now Operation
7 must either bring out a result equal to zero (if <EM>n</EM>=1); or a result
<EM>greater</EM> than <EM>zero</EM>, as in the present case; and the engine
follows the one or the other of the two courses just explained, contingently on
the one or the other result of Operation 7. In order fully to perceive the
necessity of this <EM>experimental</EM> operation, it is important to keep in
mind what was pointed out, that we are not treating a perfectly isolated and
independent computation, but one out of a series of antecedent and prospective
computations. <BR clear=right>
<P>Cards 8, 9, 10 produce <IMG align=absMiddle alt=-½·((2n-1)/(2n+1))+B_1(2n/2)
height=25 src="images/adaeq18.gif" width=143>.  In
Operation 9 we see an example of an upper index which again becomes a value
after having passed from preceding values to zero. V<SUB>11</SUB> has
successively been <SUP>0</SUP>V<SUB>11</SUB>, <SUP>1</SUP>V<SUB>11</SUB>,
<SUP>2</SUP>V<SUB>11</SUB>, <SUP>0</SUP>V<SUB>11</SUB>,
<SUP>3</SUP>V<SUB>11</SUB>; and, from the nature of the office which
V<SUB>11</SUB> performs in the calculation, its index will continue to go
through further changes of the same description, which, if examined, will be
found to be regular and periodic.
<P>Card 12 has to perform the same office as Card 7 did in the preceding
section; since, if <EM>n</EM> had been =2, the 11th operation would have
completed the computation of B<SUB>3</SUB>.
<P>Cards 13 to 20 make A<SUB>3</SUB>. Since A<SUB>2<EM>n</EM>-1</SUB> always
consists of 2<EM>n</EM>-1 factors, A<SUB>3</SUB> has three factors; and it will
be seen that Cards 13, 14, 15, 16 make the second of these factors, and then
multiply it with the first; and that 17, 18, 19, 20 make the third factor, and
then multiply this with the product of the two former factors.
<P>Card 23 has the office of Cards 11 and 7 to perform, since if <EM>n</EM> were
=3, the 21st and 22nd operations would complete the computation of
B<SUB>5</SUB>. As our case is B<SUB>7</SUB>, the computation will continue one
more stage; and we must now direct attention to the fact, that in order to
compute A<SUB>7</SUB> it is merely necessary precisely to repeat the group of
Operations 13 to 20; and then, in order to complete the computation of
B<SUB>7</SUB>, to repeat Operations 21, 22.
<P>It will be perceived that every unit added to <EM>n</EM> in
B<SUB>2<EM>n</EM>-1</SUB>, entails an additional repetition of operations
(13...23) for the computation of B<SUB>2<EM>n</EM>-1</SUB>. Not only are all the
<EM>operations</EM> precisely the same however for every such repetition, but
they require to be respectively supplied with numbers from the very <EM>same
pairs of columns</EM>; with only the one exception of Operation 21, which will
of course need B<SUB>5</SUB> (from V<SUB>23</SUB>) instead of B<SUB>3</SUB>
(from V<SUB>22</SUB>). This identity in the <EM>columns</EM> which supply the
requisite numbers must not be confounded with identity in the <EM>values</EM>
those columns have upon them and give out to the mill. Most of those values
undergo alterations during a performance of the operations (13...23), and
consequently the columns present a new set of values for the <EM>next</EM>
performance of (13...23) to work on.
<P>At the termination of the <EM>repetition</EM> of operations (13...23) in
computing B<SUB>7</SUB>, the alterations in the values on the Variables are,
that

<P>In this state the only remaining processes are, first, to transfer the value
which is on V<SUB>13</SUB> to V<SUB>24</SUB>; and secondly, to reduce
V<SUB>6</SUB>, V<SUB>7</SUB>, V<SUB>13</SUB> to zero, and to <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch_foot.html#note21" name=BKnote21>add
<EM>one</EM></A> to V<SUB>3</SUB>, in order that the engine may be ready to
commence computing B<SUB>9</SUB>. Operations 24 and 25 accomplish these
purposes. It may be thought anomalous that Operation 25 is represented as
leaving the upper index of V<SUB>3</SUB> still=unity; but it must be remembered
that these indices always begin anew for a separate calculation, and that
Operation 25 places upon V<SUB>3</SUB> the <EM>first</EM> value <EM>for the new
calculation</EM>.
<P>It should be remarked, that when the group (13...23) is <EM>repeated</EM>,
changes occur in some of the <EM>upper</EM> indices during the course of the
repetition: for example, <SUP>3</SUP>V<SUB>6</SUB> would become
<SUP>4</SUP>V<SUB>6</SUB> and <SUP>5</SUP>V<SUB>6</SUB>.
<P><A name=cycleOfVariables>We thus see</A> that when <EM>n</EM>=1, nine
Operation-cards are used; that when <EM>n</EM>=2, fourteen Operation-cards are
used; and that when <EM>n</EM>&gt;2, twenty-five Operation-cards are used; but
that no <EM>more</EM> are needed, however great <EM>n</EM> may be; and not only
this, but that these same twenty-five cards suffice for the successive
computation of all the Numbers from B<SUB>1</SUB> to B<SUB>2<EM>n</EM>-1</SUB>
inclusive. With respect to the number of <EM>Variable</EM>-cards, it will be
remembered, from the explanations in previous Notes, that an average of three
such cards to each <EM>operation</EM> (not however to each
Operation-<EM>card</EM>) is the estimate. According to this, the computation of
B<SUB>1</SUB> will require twenty-seven Variable-cards; B<SUB>3</SUB> forty-two
such cards; B<SUB>5</SUB> seventy-five; and for every succeeding B after
B<SUB>5</SUB>, there would be thirty-three additional Variable-cards (since each
repetition of the group (13...23) adds eleven to the number of operations
required for computing the previous B). But we must now explain, that whenever
there is a <EM>cycle of operations</EM>, and if these merely require to be
supplied with numbers from the <EM>same pairs of columns</EM>, and likewise each
operation to place its <EM>result</EM> on the <EM>same</EM> column for every
repetition of the whole group, the process then admits of a <EM>cycle of
Variable-cards</EM> for effecting its purposes. There is obviously much more
symmetry and simplicity in the arrangements, when cases do admit of repeating
the Variable as well as the Operation-cards. Our present example is of this
nature. The only exception to a <EM>perfect identity</EM> in <EM>all</EM> the
processes and columns used, for every repetition of Operations (13...23), is,
that Operation 21 always requires one of its factors from a new column, and
Operation 24 always puts its result on a new column. But as these variations
follow the same law at each repetition (Operation 21 always requiring its factor
from a column <EM>one</EM> in advance of that which it used the previous time,
and Operation 24 always putting its result on the column <EM>one</EM> in advance
of that which received the previous result), they are easily provided for in
arranging the recurring group (or cycle) of Variable-cards.
<P>We may here remark, that the average estimate of three Variable-cards coming
into use to each operation, is not to be taken as an absolutely and literally
correct amount for all cases and circumstances. Many special circumstances,
either in the nature of a problem, or in the arrangements of the engine under
certain contingencies, influence and modify this average to a greater or less
extent; but it is a very safe and correct <EM>general</EM> rule to go upon. In
the preceding case it will give us seventy-five Variable-cards as the total
number which will be necessary for computing any B after B<SUB>3</SUB>. This is
very nearly the precise amount really used, but we cannot here enter into the
minutiæ of the few particular circumstances which occur in this example (as
indeed at some one stage or other of probably most computations) to modify
slightly this number.
<P>It will be obvious that the very <EM>same</EM> seventy-five Variable-cards
may be repeated for the computation of every succeeding Number, just on the same
principle as admits of the repetition of the thirty-three Variable-cards of
Operations (13...23) in the computation of any <EM>one</EM> Number. Thus there
will be a <EM>cycle of a cycle</EM> of Variable-cards.
<P>If we now apply the notation for cycles, as explained in <A
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html#NoteE">Note E</A>., we may
express the operations for computing the Numbers of Bernoulli in the following
manner:--
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=124 src="images/notegt1.gif"
width=632> </CENTER>
<P>Again,
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=38 src="images/notegt2.gif"
width=564> </CENTER>
<P>represents the total operations for computing every number in succession,
from B<SUB>1</SUB> to B<SUB>2<EM>n</EM>-1</SUB> inclusive.
<P>In this formula we see a <EM>varying cycle</EM> of the <EM>first</EM> order,
and an ordinary cycle of the <EM>second</EM> order. The latter cycle in this
case includes in it the varying cycle.
<P>On inspecting the ten Working-Variables of the diagram, it will be perceived,
that although the <EM>value</EM> on any one of them (excepting V<SUB>4</SUB> and
V<SUB>5</SUB>) goes through a series of changes, the <EM>office</EM> which each
performs is in this calculation <EM>fixed</EM> and <EM>invariable</EM>. Thus
V<SUB>6</SUB> always prepares the <EM>numerators</EM> of the factors of any A;
V<SUB>7</SUB> the <EM>denominators</EM>. V<SUB>8</SUB> always receives the
(2<EM>n</EM>-3)th factor of A<SUB>2<EM>n</EM>-1</SUB>, and V<SUB>9</SUB> the
(2<EM>n</EM>-1)th. V<SUB>10</SUB> always decides which of two courses the
succeeding processes are to follow, by feeling for the value of <EM>n</EM>
through means of a subtraction; and so on; but we shall not enumerate further.
It is desirable in all calculations so to arrange the processes, that the
<EM>offices</EM> performed by the Variables may be as uniform and fixed as
possible.
<P>Supposing that it was desired not only to tabulate B<SUB>1</SUB>,
B<SUB>3</SUB>, &amp;c., but A<SUB>0</SUB>, A<SUB>1</SUB>, &amp;c.; we have only
then to appoint another series of Variables, V<SUB>41</SUB>, V<SUB>42</SUB>,
&amp;c., for receiving these latter results as they are successively produced
upon V<SUB>11</SUB>. Or again, we may, instead of this, or in addition to this
second series of results, wish to tabulate the value of each successive
<EM>total</EM> term of the series (8.), viz. A<SUB>0</SUB>,
A<SUB>1</SUB>B<SUB>1</SUB>, A<SUB>3</SUB>B<SUB>3</SUB>, &amp;c. We have then
merely to multiply each B with each corresponding A, as produced, and to place
these successive products on Result-columns appointed for the purpose.
<P>The formula (8.) is interesting in another point of view. It is one
particular case of the general Integral of the following Equation of Mixed
Differences:--
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=55 src="images/notegn5.gif"
width=436> </CENTER>
<P>for certain special suppositions respecting <EM>z</EM>, <EM>x</EM> and
<EM>n</EM>.
<P>The <EM>general</EM> integral itself is of the form,
<P>
<CENTER><IMG height=28 src="images/notegn6.gif"
width=560> </CENTER>
<P>and it is worthy of remark, that the engine might (in a manner more or less
similar to the preceding) calculate the value of this formula upon most
<EM>other</EM> hypotheses for the functions in the integral with as much, or (in
many cases) with more ease than it can formula (8.).
