<P>Charles Babbage died in 1871. He commenced the Difference Engine about 1822,
and the Government abandoned it in 1842. He commenced the Analytical Engine
about 1833.
<P>A few years before his death he began to execute in metal that part which he
called the "Mill," where the operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division can be performed.
<P>I will give here an extract from Part II. of his <EM>Essay towards the
Calculus of Functions</EM>, 1816, because it shows the working of his mind at
that time, which further on led him to devote his life to the perfection of
machinery for the numerical solution of Functions arrived at by mathematical
analysis:--
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"My subsequent inquiries have produced several new methods of
  solving functional equations containing only one variable quantity and much
  more complicated, and have convinced me of the importance of the Calculus,
  particularly as an instrument of discovery in the more difficult branches of
  analysis. Nor is it only in the recesses of this abstract science that its
  advantages will be felt: it is peculiarly adapted to the discovery of those
  laws of action by which one particle of matter attracts or repels another of
  the same or a different species; consequently it may be applied to every
  branch of natural philosophy, where the object is to discover by calculation
  from the results of experiment the laws which regulate the action of the
  ultimate particles of bodies. To the accomplishment of these desirable
  purposes, it must be confessed that it is in its present state unequal; but
  should the labours of future inquirers give to it that perfection which other
  methods of investigation have attained, it is not too much to hope that its
  maturer age shall unveil the hidden laws which govern the phenomena of
  magnetic, electric, or even of chemical action." </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To which I would add also the laws which govern our Cosmos, the leading
object of this Society.
<P>By his will he left all that existed of his analytical engine, its drawings
and notations, as well as his workshop and tools, to me, his youngest son. I was
at that time on furlough in England, and after his death I endeavoured to
complete the work as far as the instructions in the hands of the workmen
admitted, and in that state it remains in the <A
href="http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/">South Kensington Museum</A> at the present day.
<P>I had to return to India at the end of my leave, but retired from the Indian
Service in 1874.
<P>Among the things which came to me in his will there was a large number of
pieces fitted and ready for the difference engine; but many of the frame plates
had been cut up and used by my father for experimental work. I thought to
replace them and put together what existed. 1 began by having plates made to
complete the framework as originally designed, and to put in their places the
pieces, some completely finished and others less so. I also contrived a new
driving gear which answered perfectly, but I found the expenses heavy and the
utility doubtful, and about 1879, not knowing what to do with it, I sent the
whole (excepting five or six small pieces sent to different places) to the
melting-pot.
<P>About that time I heard that Mr. Wilkinson, a nephew and successor of
Clement, had broken up his workshop and melted up what remained there of the
unfinished pieces of the difference engine. Had I known this in time I might
have kept what I had, for I still hold to the opinion expressed in <EM>Babbage's
Calculating Engine</EM>, published in 1889, that the calculating part of the
difference engine might have been completed, at the time the Government gave it
up, for, say, £500.

hspace=5 src="images/hpbae.jpg" width=307> In 1856 I
turned my attention to the machine of the Messrs. Schentz, and, with a view of
instructing myself, I applied my father's system of Mechanical Notation to their
machine. My father was very pleased with my work, and sent me to exhibit my
diagrams at the meeting of the British Association at Glasgow. The diagrams are
now in the South Kensington Museum, and I have employed the notation for the
present machine, and have found it very useful.
<P>Soon after my return to England I began to think that I might be able to
complete the "Mill," not as part of the larger machine which my father proposed,
but something which would be practically useful by itself in the hands of a
skilled operator.
<P>The iron top and bottom frame plates were cast in 1880, and the work was
carried on, somewhat intermittently, until the 21st. of January 1888, when the
machine produced a table from 1st. to 44th. multiples of <IMG alt=Pi height=10
src="images/pi.gif" width=11> to twenty-nine places of
figures, which could have been prolonged indefinitely; but the machinery did not
work smoothly, and in the 32nd. multiple of <IMG alt=Pi height=10
src="images/pi.gif" width=11> the carriage had failed
and a figure had gone wrong. For a time I was discouraged, and in 1896
circumstances led me to discontinue the work, and I turned to other less
expensive pursuits and offered the unfinished work of my father, with all the
drawings and papers belonging to it, as well as my own imperfect work, to the
South Kensington Museum, and the offer was accepted.
<P>In 1906 my attention was accidentally attracted to my work. I saw what was
amiss and the way to remedy it, with the result that it was sent to the factory
of Mr. R. W. Munro at Tottenham, and, under my close supervision, it has been
completed and the apparatus made to print the calculated results on paper, from
which a zinc block has been made. <BR clear=right>

<CENTER><EM>Errata.</EM> </CENTER>
<P>The Secretaries are indebted to several correspondents for pointing out
errata in the facsimile of work produced by General Babbage's calculating
machine (<CITE>M.N.</CITE>, vol. lxx. p. 520).
<P>These errors are not entirely the same as certain errors in the facsimile
sheet distributed by General Babbage at the meeting.
<P>General Babbage has kindly given the following explanation of this.
<P>Two separate calculations A and B were made on the machine while it stood in
the maker's shops, and several mistakes occurred.
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>A wrong value of <IMG alt=Pi height=10
  src="images/pi.gif" width=11> •was given to the
  machine in both cases, so that the whole of the multiples are wrong as
  multiples of <IMG alt=Pi height=10
  src="images/pi.gif" width=11>.
  <P></P>
  <LI>In A the printing mechanism of the machine made errors in 8<IMG alt=Pi
  height=10 src="images/pi.gif" width=11>, 9<IMG alt=Pi
  height=10 src="images/pi.gif" width=11>, and 11<IMG
  alt=Pi height=10 src="images/pi.gif" width=11>. This
  is the specimen reproduced in the <CITE>M.N.</CITE>
  <P></P>
  <LI>In B the printing mechanism made an error in 22<IMG alt=Pi height=10
  src="images/pi.gif" width=11>. This is the specimen
  distributed by General Babbage at the meeting. </LI></OL>
<P>The failure in printing was due to weakness in certain springs, which had
been strengthened before the machine was exhibited; thus the printed figures did
not agree with the calculated.
<P>The following corrections should be made in the facsimile printed in the
<CITE>M.N.</CITE>
<P>In <IMG alt=Pi height=10 src="images/pi.gif"

correction throughout.
