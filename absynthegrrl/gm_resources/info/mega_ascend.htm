<p class="pagecaption">Mega Corp Ascendency</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is the usage label applied to the time between the late 1890s and late 1990s when the <a href="../companies_inx.htm">Mega-Corps</a> began to coalesce and form. The time is marked by rapid declines in the powers of traditional governments, including the democratic experiment of the United States. The Mega-Corps began forming their own para-military security forces. By the end of the 1950s these forces rivaled many nation-state military groups.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the mid 1970s the Mega-Corps had the governance powers over the rest of the populations. Some were benevolent and some were not. Those desiring to live in peace and prosperity soon found the only avenue was to sigh on with on of the Corps.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Arcology living began on the Isle of Wight in the 1890s. This facility was a group of gated housing tracts set up and maintained by <a href="ciwl_etc.htm">ITC</a> for its employees working at the construction and test facilities located on the island. By the late 1980s arcologies were the norm for Corp personnel. They offered increased security and luxurious living situations.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Ascendency Dev Notes</p>

<p class="regtxt5">update Savoy - need a name and they become a hotel mega-corp, one of the first
a Hilton equivalent fills this spot in the US</p>

<p class="regtxt5">it is likely the US is the most resistant nation-state - taking the longest to fall to the corporate governemnt - because of its isolation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">things to consider - tech came from Babbage Engine computation systems driven by steam
would the Engineer help with electricity?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">did the Wellinghams get a tech idea infusion from the Hut?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hut has electricity, computers, fusion power systems, and other gadjets that could jump the earth tech in different ways far sooner than in our time-line.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">a power consortium will form - it could start as a subsidiary of ITC - sort of a United Energy and Transport kind of idea. there should be competing groups coming on line later - eventually leading to a diversified global energy field</p>

<p class="regtxt5">ITC could license out FRP tech to other dev groups in other places where power is in demand</p>

<p class="regtxt5">postulate FRP tech being large enough to not be practical for person transport solutions - could consider battery technology coming online instead of oil/gas/internal combustion for personal transport drives.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">need a company that specializes in spun fiber technologies - this will form the webbing and structures used for the chunnel project. this should come through the Door, maybe as a result of Valen and She... interacting. need name for this company. this can be funded as a startup by ITC.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">given the close ties of all these business units would the British Crown attempt to force a breakup into smaller independent companies? this could prompt the first Corp/Government war and begin the stage for Mega-Corp domination.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the Wellinghams will begin to feel social pressures from their peers as the peers realize ITC and industrialization are breaking down the "old order" way of doing things. it has little effect - it would effect Lucy and Mina in their selection of spouses, however, since neither is that interested, it is an empty threat. particularly as the members of their "peer" group would expect them to not work.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">this will begin an erosion of women as protected citizens. should lead to a sufferage-like motion far earlier. ITC will introduce programs to hire women and train them, further eroding the social condition. ITC provides legal assistance to all women employees, negating the norms of the time and allowing women control over their own pay, health, and safety. This further degrades relations between the Wellinghams and "the peerage".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If Lucy and Borusa hook up it will cement the ITC/HyperDyne alliance</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lucy, Mina, et. al. will not be removed by the Hut.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">need name of law firm ITC contracts with</p>
