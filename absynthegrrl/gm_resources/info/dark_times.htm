<p class="regtxt5">About forty years ago forces allied with the Demon Lords of Hell attempted to open the seven Hell Gates. These gates are portals leading directly into Hell itself. If they had managed to open all seven gates then the greater demons and lords would have had free access to the prime material plane.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fortunately several bands of brave (foolish) adventurers were on hand to prevent the opening of all gates. In a series of great battles employing numerous majikal items and much power these adventurers managed to seal all but one of the Hell Gates. This final gate resides under the fortress of the leader of the Dark Forces, known only as the Hand. At the end of the battles these adventurous souls scattered and retired to various different places. These adventurers lacked several essential major artifacts to seal the final gate but they were able to drive the Dark Forces back to their one main holding and destroy large numbers of their following.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There has been no evidence of Dark Force activity in the last 30 years.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Very few of these events really impacted the Free Islands so this is most of what is known on the islands. The Lotus Empire provided some troops for one of the major assaults against a Hell Gate located beyond their northern border. A few adventurers from the Free Islands were involved in the outer assault troops. Only the bands of fearless adventurers mentioned above actually went inside the temples that housed the Hell Gates.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It is of course feared that the Hand is sitting quietly and marshalling his forces for another attempt at opening the gates but no hard evidence has been seen.</p>
