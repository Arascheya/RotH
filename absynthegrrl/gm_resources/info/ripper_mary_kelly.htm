<font color="#c90000">APR 1887-MAR 1888</font>
<BR><br>
Kelly and Barnett lived in George St, then moved to
Little Paternoster Row, Dorset St, and then they lived in
Brick Lane.<sup><font color="#000000">19</font></sup>
<BR><br>

<a name="areamap"></a>
<font color="#c90000">MAR 1888</font>
<BR><br>
Kelly and Barnett finally moved into 13 Miller's Court, 26 Dorset St. This single room, <font size="2" color="#000000">(10 ft. x 12 ft.)</font> was actually the ground floor back room of the main house, partitioned off from it. The only door was just inside the arched entry to the court. The couple’s rent was 4s/6d <font size="2" color="#000000">(22 ½p)</font> per week. <font size="2" color="#000000">(the rent was 29/- (£1 45p) behind when Kelly died.)</font><sup><font color="#000000">20</font></sup>

<ol>
Dorset St ran east-west from Commercial St to Crispin St. At the Commercial St end it faced the churchyard of Christ Church, Spitalfields  an area sometimes known as <em>Itchy Park</em>. Opposite the western end stood the Providence Row Night Refuge and Convent at 50 Crispin St, Dorset St was quite a narrow thoroughfare and was about 130 yards long. It was flanked by old, brick-built properties, probably dating from the early eighteenth century, whose doors opened directly to the street.
<BR><br>
Dorset St's properties were numbered consecutively along the south side from west to east (1-20) and back along the north side from east to west (21-39). Guarding either end on the north side were 2 pubs. The 3-story Britannia <font size="2" color="#000000">(aka Ringer’s after its landlady, Matilda Ringer)</font> was actually #87 Commercial St, at the eastern end, whilst the similarly imposing Horn Of Plenty, <font size="2" color="#000000">(officially #5 Crispin St, landlord Christopher Brown)</font> was at the western end. 3 alleyways ran out of the northern side of Dorset St: Paternoster Row, which lay between #35 & #36 ran all the way into Brushfield St, exiting alongside the Oxford Arms pub. It contained several common-lodging houses. The others were New Court and Miller's Court, both of which contained low-grade housing. New Court was almost mid-street, its narrow entry located between #33 & #34. The narrow entrance to Miller's Court was about a quarter of the way along the street from the eastern end, nestling between #26 & #27, both of which were owned by a grocer and slum property landlord, John McCarthy. Whilst McCarthy resided at #27 and carried on his chandler's business from its ground floor shop, #26 was being used as a storeroom at the time of the murder.
<BR><br>
A pub called the Blue Coat Boy (William James Turner) stood at #32. 2 other chandlers provided competition to McCarthy, Barnett Price at #7 and Alfred Coates at #36. A feature of the locality was the 'slum landlord' who owned or rented a number of cheap properties. Coates, for instance, also had a common lodging house in Flower & Dean St. In addition to his shops, John McCarthy was also the landlord of the properties in Miller's Court <font size="2" color="#000000">(aka McCarthy's Rents or McCarthy's Court)</font>. In 1890, his brother Daniel took over the shop at #36. Eventually John McCarthy acquired the common lodging house at #30, one of many such houses in Dorset St.

<BR><br>
Two large lodging houses were known as Crossingham's after their owner, William Crossingham; namely #35 where Annie Chapman had lodged and #17 opposite the entrance to Miller's Court. Other known lodging houses at the time were nos. 9, 10, 11-12 and 28-29. In all about 750 beds were provided in Dorset St, officially <font size="2" color="#000000">(though the rules were flouted widely and in practice there would have been many more)</font>.
<BR><br>
<a name="povertymap"></a>
Most of the properties that were not registered lodging houses were rented out to tenants on a room by room basis. There is little evidence of other businesses being conducted from Dorset St. in the 1880s, but in the years following we see two milk contractors listed (at #13A & #14A by Messrs William Wright & Amos Payne) and a coal dealer, Mrs Jane Brooks from #39. Since the Brooks family was resident at #39 by 1881 there is a good chance that the business was operational much earlier than its listing in Kelly’s Directory.
<BR><br>
Dorset Street possessed a bad reputation. It was renowned for its poverty and crime. Being part of what the Rev. Barnett called the "wicked quarter mile", it fell within H-Division of the Metropolitan Police and was one of the streets that was double patrolled. Charles Booth, an early sociologist who surveyed London, produced his <em>poverty map</em> in 1887, colour coding the different streets of the metropolis. Dorset St achieved the lowest ranking, shaded black and described as vicious and semi-criminal.
<BR><br>
Miller's Court was approached from Dorset St. via a flagged passage that ran under an arch. Little more than a yard wide, it was about twenty feet long. The door to Room 13 was the last on the right before the passage opened out into a yard about fifteen feet square. The yard contained a water tap and a communal dustbin. There was no other access to #13, which had been partitioned off from the back of 26 Dorset St. The two windows of #13 looked out into the yard. Along the left-hand side of Miller's Court the passage extended beyond the yard for a further forty feet, here being about ten feet wide. It was flanked by lines of two-story, 'one up, one down' slum houses, built of brick. Miller’s Court had 2 units on the left, <font size="2" color="#000000">(the last not being used as accommodation)</font> and 3 on the right. Numbering started with #1, downstairs on the left, with #2 above it, running down the left side and back up on the right such that #12 was upstairs, nearest to Mary's window. The houses were all whitewashed at ground floor level. Light was provided by a gas lamp mounted on the wall outside #1.<sup><font color="#000000">21</font></sup>

Mary Ann Cox, a widow and an unfortunate, residing at 5
Miller's Court <font size="2" color="#000000">(last house top of the court)</font>, saw Kelly with a man.<sup><font color="#000000">50</font></sup>

<ol>
The man was short, stout, with a blotchy faced. He looked to
be in his thirties. He had a short carroty moustache, a billycock
hat, a longish dark shabby coat, and a quart pale of beer. Kelly
wore a linsey frock and a red knitted crossover shawl.<sup><font color="#000000">51</font></sup>
</ol>
They stood ahead of Cox, going up the court. Cox said, "Good
night, Mary Jane." Kelly replied, "Good night. I'm going to have
a song." Cox knew Kelly was drunk, and Kelly started singing. The
man made no noise, but closed the door behind them as they went
into Kelly's room. There was a light from the window, but the
shade was drawn. Cox continued onto her room.<sup><font color="#000000">52</font></sup>

George Hutchinson, Victoria Home, Commercial St, walked up Commercial St. He passed Thrawl St, and just before reaching Flower and Dean St, he met Kelly. "Will you lend me a sixpence?" she asked. "I can't. I spent all my money going down to Rumford," he replied. She said, "Good morning. I must go and find some money," and she continued on toward Thrawl St.
<BR><br>
Hutchinson then saw a man approach Kelly from the opposite
direction. He tapped her on the shoulder, saying something. They
both started laughing. Kelly said, "All right." The man then
said, "You will be all right for what I have told you." He put
his right hand on her shoulder. In his left hand was some type of
small parcel, American cloth, with a strap around it.
<BR><br>
Hutchinson stood against the lamp outside of The Queen's Head
pub, <font size="2" color="#000000">(74 Commercial St, north corner of Commercial St & Fashion St)</font>,
and continued to watch Kelly and the man as they walked back up
Commercial St. As they passed, the man put his head down with
his hat over his eyes.

<ol>
The man was Jewish-looking, respectable appearance, long dark
coat with astrakhan collar and cuffs, dark jacket, and trousers,
light waistcoat, dark felt hat turned down in the middle, lined
collar, black tie with a horseshoe pin, button boots, gaiters
with white buttons, thick gold watch chain with a red-stoned
seal. He was 34-35, 5'-6", pale complexion, dark hair and
eyelashes, slight moustche culred up at each end. <font size="2" color="#000000">(Hutchinson
stooped down to see the man's face. The man sternly looked back.
Kelly and the man went on into Dorset St, and Hutchinson
followed them.)</font><sup><font color="#000000">64</font></sup>
</ol>
Kelly and the man stood at the corner of the court. The man
said something, and Kelly replied, "All right my dear. Come
along, and you'll be comfortable." The man then placed an arm her
shoulder and gave her a kiss. "I seemed to have lost my
handkerchief," Kelly said. The man then pulled out a red one and
gave it to her.<sup><font color="#000000">65</font></sup>
<BR><br>
Kelly and the man went up the court. Hutchinson followed
them, but could not see them.<sup><font color="#000000">66</font></sup>

Hutchinson then waited to see if they would come out.<sup><font color="#000000">67</font></sup>

a black wide-awake hat. Further up the court, Lewis saw a man and
a woman. The woman was drunk, and no one else was in the court.
Lewis continued on to the Keyler's, 2 Miller's Court <font size="2" color="#000000">(room above Venturney's room)</font>. Once there, she fell asleep in a chair.<sup><font color="#000000">69</font></sup>

Caroline Maxwell, 14 Dorset St, wife of a lodging-house
deputy from Dorset St, said she saw Kelly standing at the
corner of the court. Kelly wore a green bodice, dark skirt, and a

Sup Arnold ordered McCarthy to force open the door, which
struck a small table standing on the left of the bed.<sup><font color="#000000">92</font></sup>
<BR><br>
a search of the room was made. Photographs were taken. Dr

<font size="2" color="#000000">(part of a hat brim was in the grate and a near-by kettle had a
melted spout and handle. The ashes were still warm.)</font><sup><font color="#000000">93</font></sup>

<a name="description"></a>
<font color="#c90000">NOTE:</font>
<BR>
What
description we have of Kelly comes from several sources: Mrs
Phoenix stated Kelly was "5 feet 7 inches in height, and of
rather stout build with blue eyes and a very fine head of hair
which reached nearly to her waste;" Mrs Prater described her as
tall, pretty, "fair as a lilly," and "on good terms with
everybody;" yet, Mrs Maxwell described her as "a pleasant little
woman, rather stout, fair complexion, and rather pale...spoke
with a kind of impediment." It is known that she was about 25
years of age, and might have had a little boy living with her <font size="2" color="#000000">(per Barnett the boy was 6-7 years old, and he and Kelly had only been together for about 18 months total)</font>, and she was
considered quite attractive with a fair and fresh colored
complexion. She was known on sight to Insp Dew, who said she
paraded around Whitechapel usually with 2-3 friends. She
never wore a hat, always wore a spotless clean white apron, and
had a reputation for violence and a quick temper. Her alleged
nicknames were "Black Mary," "Fair Emma," and "Ginger."<sup><font color="#000000">125</font></sup>

<BR><br>
It is also known that the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) made
inquiries in Limerick to trace her family, and that 2 members
of the RIC were at Miller's Court, assisting the Metropolitan
Police with their investigations.<sup><font color="#000000">126</font></sup>
