<p class="regtxt5">Seal Teams are sent out by Ishra to seal dangerous or unused gates. They are under the command of a Spider Born. Teams are multi-racial, drawing from any realm that is gate-aware.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Each team is issued a <a href="../items/spidership.htm">Spider Ship</a> as part of their equipment. They are trained by Ishra in the best strategies and techniques of sealing or closing gates. Seal Teams can either seal a gate system, or close it entirely, depending on circumstances and directives. They also have the best training to handle special or emergency circumstances.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are seven seal teams, although team 6 has gone missing.</p>
