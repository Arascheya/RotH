<p class="pagecaption">Ezra's or Ezra's Magic Shop</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ezra's Magic Shop is owned by <a href="../npcs/nikki_b.htm">Nikki</a>, <a href="../npcs/mira_b.htm">Mira</a>, and <a href="../npcs/olivia_b.htm">Olivia</a> Bishop. Mira runs the store because Nikki is a Yew Nork police detective. The shop has been in the family since great grandfather Ezra Bishop started it. The shop had a dry spell as capitalism dominated and the idea of entertainment turned to video games, movies, and TV. Starting five years ago the shop has seen a resurgence. This is partly from Mira's awakening to things beyond the veil and the forming of the Mirror Souk by the Arakovs just down the block.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nikki can see anyone touched from beyond the veil. Mira, known as Lady Zarysha, is a rising star on the local magic circuit, is brilliant with trick mechanics, and is a talented reader after her awakening. Olivia is a potion guru and sorceress of decet strength. Olivia, Nikki, and Mira's awakenings were unexpected and accidental, caused when a planar entered their shop, thinking it was a true magic items shop. He kept asking questions that forced the sisters to begin to question, then traded them a real artifact for a set of tarot cards. Residuals from the artifact woke them up. They still have no idea what the artifact is for, just that it radiates quite a lot of power under starlight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Artifact is a Star Crystal from the cult of Star Power Druids, who use the energy of the stars in their rituals and spells. Most Star Druids have long since passed from the multi-verse, but the star gems are quite valuable to any arcane that understands how to derive power from them. Olivia wears it on a platinum-iridium chainmail necklace of a quite ornate nature. Something about the gem comforts her, reducing odd nightmares about starships, attacks, and evacuations.</p>

The Bishop sisters live above the shop, each sister having a floor and sharing the roof-top patio. Nikki is on the second floor, Olivia on the third, and Mira on the fourth. There is a second entry to the occult section of the shop in the basement access.</p>
