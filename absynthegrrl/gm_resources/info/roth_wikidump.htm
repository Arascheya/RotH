Realms of the Hut Online
Teaser

Many forces contend for power in the Realms of the Hut. Each seeking ascendency over the others. Good seeks to triumph over evil, order over chaos, anarchy over law, yet the Realms would suffer as much under too much "good" as under too much "evil". Every extreme threatens the whole, thus the Keepers of the Balance work in the shadows to keep the multi-verse from tearing itself apart.

Each person chooses an ethos that they live by. Sometimes it is conscious and sometimes not, yet each one forms a part of the whole. The actions of each being shapes the direction and focus of the Realms. What choices will you make?

Basics

Realms of the Hut Online is an MMORPG set in a multi-verse of magic, majik, and technology. The opportunities for advancement and adventure are endless as new realms, planes, heavens, hells, and everything in between are developed and added.

Expanded Description

The Realms of the Hut takes place across a multiverse of worlds. On every world there are nexus events occurring between the polarities of all races. These polarities include Law, Order, Chaos, Anarchy, Good, Evil, Light, and Dark. Each player will choose their own ethos and beliefs and these will evolve over time as they explore more of the Realms around them.

While the choice of Polarity can seem obvious at the first, it is important to remember the multiverse suffers as much under too much Law as too much Anarchy, too much Good as too much Evil. Because of this, there is a last group, working from the shadows, to prevent the multiverse from tearing itself apart. These are the Keepers of the Balance. The exact ways in which Keepers are recruited is not known, only that some are called and few accept.

Within the Realms of the Hut your character's actions will change the face of destiny across the multiverse. There will be epic battles between the various Polarities as each group strives for supremacy. Sometimes the fate of the many depends on the actions of the few. You have the chance to be one of the few and carve your fame across the ages.

What This Game Is

You choose your own path and skills. You will not be forced into pre-defined classes.
Character advancement is based on the skills you use.
Everyone has the opportunity to see different quests, adventures, and paths through the game based on their choices along the way. The Realms of the Hut will unfold differently for every player.
Combat is not the only answer to quests, power struggles, and stories. Many events have multiple ways of completion.
This is a hybrid environment - there are "theme park" style missions, however, the political and power intrigues are sandbox based. Players can aspire to control almost every locale in the Realmsof the Hut.
Player progress is tracked by elements of the story they have experienced rather than just "level and loot". This needs to be demonstrated in all promotional materials and sites.
What This Game Is Not

Level based.
A grind fest.

Basic Game Concept

This is an evolving story based game. The game launches with a set of power blocks and their specific agendas. Players can aspire to take control of these blocks, tear them down, work within them, or define their own.

Player advancement is of the Rune Quest model, meaning, each skill a player has improves with use. Players begin with a basic set of skills with additions for a prototype model they chose. After that point, skills may be added through training and improved by use. This game will not "level" like the standard MMORPG. Player stats will not increase in the way of standard "leveling" MMORPGS. Skills will improve, stats may be augmented through training and magic, however, there will be hard caps on how much any stat can be boosted.

Because of this approach, numbers will always matter. A group of "low power" creatures can always take down a high power character by weight of numbers. Players will need to choose their battles carefully and group up if the really want to slay everything in their path.

Game Play

Story and political intrigues are more important than random killings. The story is set to evolve based on player changes to the power structures.

"Theme Park" Missions will be a mix of main story, power struggle, and sub-plots. All missions should advance some kind of story line or provide needed background and materials to support actions in the sandbox aspects of the game. All quests should have different out-comes and paths depending on which conversation path is chosen.

High quality gear will be available in places where solo and grouped players will have access. Realms of the hut will not limit access to high quality items to only those players that choose to group. Realms of the Hut is intended to support Solo Players at the same level as Group Players. Forced grouping of any type will not be a design element.

Solo players can take control of power blocks, however,they have to defend themselves the same as any other block.

Dungeons and multi-player lairs will be available, however, these are really just smaller power blocks and can be taken over just like any other locale. All story elements and all high quality equipment will be available without the need to run them.Dungeon and lair content will enrich the world, but none are critical for story lines.

Players can choose to be crafters, merchants, inn-keepers, or other non-adventuring professions. Apprenticeships and other tasks will be necessary before being able to own a store-front or business. Players can always seek employment in various establishments. Mechanics for this can be simple in the first release and built upon dependent on player interest.

Leaders of all major powers start as NPCs under control of Rani Corp. Deposed NPCs can remain in game or fade away based on story and design decisions.

User perspective is switchable between First Person perspective and Visible Avatar perspective. There should be no frame-rate or performance hit from either mode.

Avatars to be highly customizable. Avatar wardrobes to be extensive, with additional styles available in various places in-world. Avatar hair styles and colors, body items such as tattoos and piercings, and weight should be customizable after the first character creation. There will be opportunities for player characters to set up and run various businesses catering to the other players. Character gender, basic size, and race should be fixed after first choice, to maintain some possibility of being recognized.

Consider some type of "makeup table" in the player Huts that provide appearance modification options, suck as make-up effects, removal of existing piercings, holes would remain for re-insertion later, and simple hair styling. This should expose a limited sub-set of the appearance modification sliders and selectors used during avatar creation. A more complete modification option will be various "chop shops" or "body mod" shops where the character pays a fee of some kind to allow more extensive customization.

Clothing can be modified by a tailor to provide additional versions of a "master garment". This will allow players to take that favorite armor or item and have variations created for different looks and situations. The tailors will charge a fee for each modified garment provided. At the end of the process the character will have the original plus the variant they contracted for.

Not all possible player races can survive equally well in the various environments and special gear will be required in some areas. This can be found, purchased, or made if the player character has the necessary skill.

Players can choose the tailoring profession as a skill choice. Various types of modifications require various levels of skill. Player tailors will have a materials cost that has to be covered for the modifications. You can provide gratis service, but the fee will still have to be paid by the tailor.

All NPCs will respond to the character based on appearance/race. For example: if a Lotus Empire person is in the High Valley, it will be noticed, commented on, and cause a stir.

NPCs will respect local time zones. This means they will close their shops in the evening, take lunch breaks, etc. Locale servers will need to be available to prevent this from locking out large numbers of users, but this is better than finding 24/7 awake NPCs, something very unhealthy for them. Game time does not equal real-time. Game time will advance more quickly, to be determined during dev cycles, to allow all regions to cycle through sleep/wake cycles of NPCs.

All areas will not automatically be open to everyone. If a thief enters the bank, the guards will shadow her. Characters not belonging to a particular faction or religion will be challenged, turned away, or interfered with if they attempt to enter an area belonging to a faction, religion, or political group. Access will require bribes, stealth, subterfuge, or other game-play related actions to gain access to that area. This can be relaxed or heightened by Players if they are in charge of the locale or facility.

Thieves can rob the banks, getting away with other player's possessions. There will be consequences in terms of reputation, guards looking for them, becoming a "wanted person" in terms of other players, etc.

Many groups of NPCs/bot-encounters will speak with the PC before initiating hostilities, unless they are aligned with an "attack on sight" or a directly opposing faction.

Avatar Advancement to be skills based rather than level based. Skills improve, however, basic "biology" can only be slightly improved. None of the more and more hit points per level for example.

A Hut Design Tool, provided as part of the game, will allow users to add custom rooms to their Hut instance and to create custom clothing and decorative items. It can also be used to create custom realms. These areas and items remain local to the player system until they have been submitted, vetted, and approved by the game design and maintenance group. Submissions require a repaired Hut (Hut basic starting quest) and the acquisition of a Hut Submission System Crystal. The HSSC is a quest item, and a new one must be found for each desired submission. The HSSC is destroyed as part of the submission process. There should be several different quests for obtaining HSSCs dependent on Realm and character skills.

This is an adult game and includes full nudity, sexual encounters, sexual innuendo, drugs, and violence. Age verification and legality will be checked for all players. Player-Player sexual encounters are permitted, however actual consent must be given by both, even if the scenario itself is violent, perverted, or strange. Either participant can disengage at any point if their comfort level is exceeded. Severe penalties will be brought against any player forcing non-consensual behavior on another player.

An adult filter can be set to reduce the display of violence and/or sexuality. This reduction will remove access to some of the quests and story lines. The player will be warned of this effect when selecting the various filtering options. There will always be a story path to the main goals that will function with full filtering on.

There will be three levels of risk available for player avatars, selectable for PvP and PvE aspects of the game.

High Risk - avatar can be captured, imprisoned, tortured, and raped before death or escape.
Medium Risk - avatar can be captured and tormented before death or escape. Torment is of a less violent and vile level than the High Risk category
Low Risk - avatar can be captured and held before death or escape, however rude things will not be done to them
Support PvP and PvE, especially in the sandbox areas. There should be safe places in each realm where Players can go for a quiet drink or take a meeting. These will often be taverns and inns. There will be at least one NPC controlled facility in each area. These NPCs will not be deposable. If Players want a more rowdy establishment, they will need to open one and run it as they choose.

Balance PvP to reduce spawn point camping. Lower level "ganking" is reduced by the no "leveling" concepts. Further reductions could be handled by either:

Reducing skills of high skilled player when engaging a lower skilled player. Difference in skills would need to be relatively large, the higher skilled player would have had to have initiated combat, and the situation would have to be a non-story related case.
Move gankers to their own server. Repeating offenders would be immediately moved to a single server where they could thump on each other to their heart's content. The character shifted would not be able to transfer back to a regular server. The ganker account would be flagged so any new character would be monitored and shifted if it engaged in the same behaviors.
Death Penalties - Player will spawn back in their bedroom in their instance of the Hut. All equipment will remain at the site of their death. Equipment is lootable, particularly in campaign related deaths. The lootable function can be reconsidered if it is abused severely. Once the player has a functioning Hut it is in their interest to jump it to their location as often as possible. Additional options for death penalties are:

Skill reduction based on type of injury. An example, brain injury would reduce skills that rely on intelligence and street-smarts. Basic body damage would reduce stamina and strength related skills. Skills will return over time. "Therapy" in the form of training with better skilled players or NPCs would reduce the time necessary to return to the previous skill level. Recovery time would be measured in game days.
Skill reduction where the skills come back slowly, over time, as the player recovers from the shock of death. This is a simpler version of the above.
Equipment does not bind to a player. Equipment may always be bought, sold, swapped, or traded.

Equipment is destroyable, either through wear or specific damage. Equipment with higher levels of enhancement is harder to destroy.

Artifacts and Major Artifacts exist in limited numbers. To improve game play all artifacts have a random jump factor as one of their enchantments. This means each use runs the risk of the Artifact jumping away from the player to some location to be found by anyone in that area. This is a settable capability at the time of design. Some Artifacts will weld themselves to a player if required by the plot.

Inventory

Players are given an option for any item they acquire. They may carry it with them in their packs, bags, or by wearing it, or they may send the item directly to the Hut treasure chambers. Any item sent to the Hut can only be retrieved by going to the treasure chambers and picking it up. This allows players to loot without as much concern for carrying their "to be sold" items.

The only "annoying" part of inventory management is selling items. In this case the player must collect what they wish to sell and transport it to one or more vendors. Carts may be rented in most major markets to allow transportation of larger amounts of goods. Cart rental costs will vary from market to market and cart vendor to cart vendor. Players would be wise to ask or shop around.

Players may purchase their own cart from the cart vendors for ridiculously high prices.

Personal inventory will follow tradition and be relatively limited to force consideration of what items are needed for any given expedition.

Factions

Various NPC Power Groups will be present at launch that could be allied with
Player created groups to form alliances with
Technology and Design Items

Free-To-Play business model. Support with ad placements, in worlds where adds for real-world items would make sense, and a store for in-game enhancements.

The Hut Designer tool comes with simple, stock textures, clothing patterns, and room designs. Enhancement packages can be purchased. Optionally - Advanced Users can import their own textures and models after careful checking by the game engine to verify integrity and function. The design tool will also allow players to craft their own realms. These can be submitted for hosting on the main servers or linked in from a server of their choice. Content will be checked by RotH personnel and entry links flagged with warnings and ratings if the content is Adult. Inflammatory, racist, other offensive content will be de-linked after verification by a RotH community support person. Any violation of the consent requirements for activities will lead to de-linking and banning of the player. The consent requirement can be checked at link time, so an entire area can then be a "rough play" area.

Game Play and Server balancing issues will be determined and addressed by design/production staff only. This is one area where complaints from the players will be used only to prompt discussion. Tester input will be given more consideration during Beta phases of development.

Have special functions for certain areas. As an example, there is a garden area near the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus (WoW). You can go in and rest, but it confers no special benefit. Would be nice to have areas that do have benefit to visit or stay in for a while.

World elements impact players. Fall off the cliff and take damage, swim in the heavy current and it will modify your trajectory or sweep you away. Skills will modify chances of falling, being swept away, etc.

Pre-Release Games
Pre-Release Games Concept

Create interest prior to actual game launch by engaging interested gamers
Provide puzzles of varying difficulty to release information before it is widely available
Games Concepts (Pre-Games)

Concept:

Start the first ones early in the development phase for information that is already locked. This would be backgrounders leading up to the environment in which the instanced huts begin to appear in the multi-verse.
Information moves from backgrounders into setting up starting conditions for main game as development progresses.
Pre-Games

Send email with Summoning Gem and simple challenge to solve for "login"
Link to web image with Summoning Gem, sun, and rock casting shadow over the gem. Player must drag the gem into the light, a new page will open showing a single room of the library, with the doors bricked over. A bell hangs over a small table, age blackened bronze, stained with years of soot from the oil lamp on the table. The lamp provides the only light in the room.
Possible Items to Include in Pre-Games

Avatar creation/customization system - once this has been tested, let pre-gamers create avatars for forums and pre-game engine using this tool. This is based off the cruder one used in Conflict for Mars.

Skills
Skills are learned by doing and by training. To learn something new the character must find someone to train then in the basics. After the initial training they can improve through using the skill or by buying additional training. It becomes harder and harder to buy training the more advanced a skill becomes.

Skills that are not practiced will degrade over time. The character will never revert to no ability at the skill, however, the advanced abilities fade if not kept current. An advanced skill can be re-learned more quickly than the first learning because there is a body-mind memory effect.

Physical and coordination based items will degrade as characters age as well. This degradation cannot be significantly reversed by additional practice or training.

Skills vs Classes

Those players wishing to avoid the complexities of individual skill learning and determination can seek out a "class trainer". A class trainer will train all skills grouped under their particular category without the character needing to call out each one. A class trainer will also give advice on what to do to improve in the areas of the particular "class".

These "classes" aren't set in stone and a player may choose to train individual skills or seek a different class trainer at any time.

To Consider:

If players are allowed to create older characters, there will need to be some type of starting skill-set modifier. This should not give significant game-play advantage, but should simulate time in-world and the learning that would occur in the starting environment.

Standard Issues:

In the games we have evaluated, the typical issue is large amounts of cash creeping into the economy and this requires arbitrary money-sinks to keep money available from spiralling out of control.

Analysis:

Compare the real world money flow with a gaming world money flow.

Real World money sources:

Employment - this is the major way
Sale of items, either produced or brokered
Exploration/prospecting - very rare, very hard, usually low results except for rare peak moments

Real World money sinks:

Housing/shelter - rent, mortgage, repairs
Food
Medical needs - includes spikes for illness or injury
Transportation either owned or used

Game World money sources:

Mob drops
Dungeon quests
Resource aquisition and sales
Equipment sales
Mission completion pay-outs

Game World money sinks:

Transportation either purchase of owned method or per-trip costs
New equipment
Arbitrary sinks - decided by designers of game and vary from game to game

Equipment repairs
Healing
Death taxes
Unusually high transportaion costs
Unusually high training costs
Game related problems:

Current game worlds are free market capitalism taken to the ludicrous extreme - infinite cash and resource inputs to a system where there is a finite number of items, services, etc. to draw it down, thus requiring arbitrary "penalties" to try and balance the economy so everything doesn't become worthless. Some of these inputs are listed below.

Mobs always drop loot, cash and items, regardless of how many times a player kills them
Dungeon quests always pay out in loot and cash for repeat runs
Resources always respawn, allowing unlimited harvesting
Repeatable missions always pay out in loot and cash
Realms of the Hut Game economy for alpha and beta testing:

Mobs only pay out loot or cash on first three encounters by any one character
Dungeons only pay out in loot or cash on first two runs
Leave resources as renewable but only usable by each character once per week. Adjust based on alpha and beta results.
Repeatable missions only pay out loot or cash the first two times they are run.
Game cash can be converted to store tokens for purchase of items. Conversion rates to be determined before launch.

Note:

This is a discussion of monetary economy only. All encounters will pay out experience for every run.

Alternate:

Consider a primarily barter based economy. In this case, items and resources are the primary currency. To acquire a custom item the player will have to complete one or more tasks for the provider. These can be resource gathering, information gathering, or anything else appropriate to the provider. Monetary currency would be for luxury items only and would not be a regular drop from mobs or hoards.

As an extension of this, consider items available have to equal items turned in. If various mobs start with five bows, then only five bows can be in rotation. For other items to enter rotation, they would have to be created for a player and then sold by that player. Once the item is sold to an NPC, it can be spawned into a mob or treasure hoard.

Need to stress that not all players will be able to have the same items at the same time. This would have the additional benefit of reducing the "theme park" feel. This availability concept would be a non-negotiable item during beta testing.
