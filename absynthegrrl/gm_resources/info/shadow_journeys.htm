<p class="regtxt5">The Shadow Journeys are a series of video games produced by CyCore Games. They deal with an old world, sliding into decay, and the people living in the shadows of its past glory.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Series</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Journey One - Leave Taking</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Starts in the Forever City, a complex warren of living areas based on the Kowloon Free City. Instead of being a small area of a much larger city, it is the city. The city began as a large, planned city, on a world rich in money and influence. As their power and influence faded, the residents had to make do with what they could scrounge and re-purpose. The fade happened long enough ago that the residents have forgotten how things were. Food is provided by automated factory systems that function outside the city. These are maintained by automated systems, however, a few ritually trained citizens provide third level support. Parts are scarce, so the entire systems is slowly breaking down. There are secret projections, held by the city rulers, that estimate when food shortages will start and how long until the situation goes critical.</p>
