<p class="pagecaption">Shadow Journeys Series</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Shadow Journeys are a series of video games produced by CyCore Games. They deal with an old world, sliding into decay, and the people living in the shadows of its past glory.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Series</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Journey One - Leave Taking</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Starts in the <a href="forevercity.htm">Forever City</a>, a complex warren of living areas based on the Kowloon Free City. Instead of being a small area of a much larger city, it is the city. The city began as a large, planned city, on a world rich in money and influence. As their power and influence faded, the residents had to make do with what they could scrounge and re-purpose. The fade happened long enough ago that the residents have forgotten how things were. Food is provided by automated factory systems that function outside the city. These are maintained by automated systems, however, a few ritually trained citizens provide third level support. Parts are scarce, so the entire systems is slowly breaking down. There are secret projections, held by the city rulers, that estimate when food shortages will start and how long until the situation goes critical.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The city has richer and poorer sections, a temple area, and the undergrounds, where the food trains come in and the automated systems distribute it. Power is loose and amorphous, with no one group being in charge. There is policing of a form, mostly in the richer areas. In the poor sections,people band together into sections, each occupying a cluster of rooms, a segment of floors, and other physically close kinds of arrangements.</p>

<p class="regtxt12"><a href="http://randomwire.com/kowloon-walled-city-rebuilt-in-japan/">Arcade built to resemble Walled City</a></p>

<p class="regtxt12">Players start out as teens in the city. There is a bit of variety in education and skills, preparing for the character professions listed below. The story unfolds based on profession and decisions, with several outcomes possible. Players can choose what social standing they come from, rich, poor, quasi-police, quasi-section enforcers, etc. Players choose possible starting experiences based on what is available in the area of the city they start in. Players can not be very high on the strata of any power group.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Journey Two</p>

<p class="regtxt12">For consideration: Adventures Under the Crescent Moon - exports from the Forever City end up on this world. This world concept is cross between Arakis and Al Quadim - plot is to figure out who the puppet masters are that rule this world from the shadows - these are from the Ashatari controlling world(s)</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Journey Three</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Consider: either the ruling planet of the Ashatari Empire or a regional governorship planet - regional would play into the final, unpublished episode</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Journey Four - planned for, but dev has not started</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Power of the Ashatari - players confrnt the might of Empire, can they shift it, bring it down, or find a place to call their own where they can access ealth and power</p>
