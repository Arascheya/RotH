<p class="pagecaption">Time Line Data</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Galactic Republic/Empire</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - galaxy wide empire, just before Razak release, she clawed her way to power and consolidated power from the old Alliance during her lifetime. She flees to Amanda as the empire begins to crumble. She did some good in her consolidation, including promoting safety for citizens and expanding the funding to the Karanal research project. Being one of the forerunners of the Ancients she lived in a time when lifespans were closer to 125 to 175 years</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Talons of the Celestial Dragon - smuggling, counter government organization during time of Alliance/Empire. One of Valen’s chief programs was to try and isolate/destroy this organization</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Elentaryn - technical director for Karanal research facility. His appointment was arranged by his father, a major force in the Talons of the Celestial Dragon. (see entry 12 Tamer, 2479 ALW in file 2469 to 4000 for more info on this)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lewellyn - time of Valen then shifted to Shandi’s time frame. Lynn does hyperdrive engineering by patterns and has developed her own display software to show it. She can’t work mathematically - she has to convert the equations to patterns, tweak the patterns, then decompose the pattern into equations, then bang on the equations until they are simplified. she dropped out of the masters engineering program because of a few instructors that cared only for the math and whether the student could produce the equations on demand - ie on tests</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Valen</p>
<p class="regtxt5">childhood - mother dies when she is 7. She believes her father killed her. Her father and brother work as data thieves. Her sister is also involved until she dies during a job. Valen is then pressed into service. (see Valen2000 for details)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">university - she is studying political science and government kinds of things, she is also beginning to work at forming contacts - mutate to place her in intelligence services as a field operative. She receives training in security and cryptography, along with basic survival training and a sampling of other skills. She functions reasonably well in hostile environments. This training gives her the edge to claw through the political jungle and seize power</p>
<p class="regtxt5">a year into her 3 year posting riots break out, she is instrumental in crushing them, using her abilities to analyze and break situations. she sets herself and Amanda as possible recruits for the uprising, then turns the military on them once she’s infiltrated. during the fighting Amanda flees, having been convinced the rioters were more right than the system.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">it takes her 30 years to rise to the position where she can stage the takeover of the senate and the disbanding of the same.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">her reign of terror lasts 25 years so she is 80 (about middle age when she is betrayed) at first she actually does improve situations some - placing strong controls to prevent government abuses, then she begins to undermine them as the necessity of government actions forces her to look the other way once in a while</p>
<p class="regtxt5">her actions directly result in the whereabouts of the Razaks being learned, by her assistant and others - they go and check it out, ending up being seduced by Onemind and beginning the destruction of the Alliance. Assistant stages coup early in Razak release, they are weak and undermanned so they are working with sedition and stealth for the first 60 years, after that the begin to step up the destruction of non Razak life</p>
<p class="regtxt5">until her overthrow and break down her primary concern is making sure no one can force her into any action or tell her what to do.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">one alternative - superceeded by Hut option - death at age 125 trying to save a child from burning. she saves the child but can’t get clear in time</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Zeltrop - Before Last War</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mirya and Annie - pre last war, their deaths set off the events leading to the war. Maybe place their deaths in part of the weapons plant rather than in the airframe.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Zeltrop - Time of the Ancients</p>
<p class="regtxt5">at some point Eltaryn recognizes that the world gates are functioning similar to hyperdrive engines. both produce a translation field allowing entry into another dimensional environment for travel, the main difference being the world gates are self sustaining and the hyperdrive requires constant initialization, also the dimensional spaces are not the same.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">During evacuation - original colonists to Karanal - need to track movements after arrival, then leaving in front of Razak patrols. basic - remained on Karanal long enough to get most of the new colony built up but then were forced to flee not much later when a random patrol found them</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Alternate Earth - After Zeltrop Evacuation</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Irendi - post evac new earth person, their departure from that world will return them to Z probably about the time Shandi has the hut config’d and has placed Castle Fred II under its own management.</p>
