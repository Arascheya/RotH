<p class="regtxt5">Chernikov is one of the few Eastern Block groups to survive the massive political and economic upheavals brought on through several radical changes in governmental structures. They have carefully bought any failing major contractor world-wide until they now control most large projects. They are one of the more benign Mega-Corps, treating their employees and clients fairly.</p>
