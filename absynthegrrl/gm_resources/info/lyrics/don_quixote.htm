<p class="pagecaption">Don Quixote</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Through the woodland through the valley</p>
<p class="regtxt5">comes a horseman wild and free</p>
<p class="regtxt5">tilting at the windmills passing</p>
<p class="regtxt5">who can that brave young horseman be?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he is wild but he is mellow, he is strong but he is weak</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he is cruel but his is gentle, he is wise but he is meek</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Reaching for his saddlebag</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he takes a battered book into his hand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">standing like a prophet now</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he shouts across the ocean to the shore</p>
<p class="regtxt5">till he can shout no more:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"I have come oer moor and mountain like a hawk upon the wing</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I was once a shining knight who was the guardian of a king</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I have searched the whole world over looking for a place to sleep</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I have seen the strong survive and I have seen the lean grow weak</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the children of the earth who wake to find the table bare</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the gentry in the country riding off to take the air"</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Reaching for his saddlebag</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he takes a rusty sword into his hand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">then striking up a knightly pose</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he shouts across the ocean to the shore</p>
<p class="regtxt5">till he can shout no more:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"See the jailor with his key who locks away all trace of sin</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the judge upon the bench who tries the case as best he can</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the wise and wicked ones who feed upon life's sacred fire</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the soldier with his gun who must be dead to be admired</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the man who tips the needle, see the man who buys and sells</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the man who puts the collar on the ones who dare not tell</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the drunkard in the tavern stealing gold to make ends meet</p>
<p class="regtxt9">see the youth in ghetto black condemned to life upon the street"</p
>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Reaching for his saddlebag</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he takes a tarnished cross into his hand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">standing like a preacher now</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he shouts across the ocean to the shore</p>
<p class="regtxt5">then in a blaze of tangled hooves</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he gallops off across the dusty plain</p>
<p class="regtxt5">in vain to search again for no one will hear</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Through the woodland through the valley</p>
<p class="regtxt5">comes a horseman wild and free</p>
<p class="regtxt5">tilting at the windmills passing</p>
<p class="regtxt5">who can that brave young horseman be?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he is wild but he is mellow,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he is strong but he is weak</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he is cruel but his is gentle,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he is wise but he is meek</p>
