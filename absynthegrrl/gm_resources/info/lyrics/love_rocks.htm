<p class="regtxt5">Neil Diamond</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Love on the rocks<br/>
Ain't no surprise<br/>
Pour me a drink<br/>
And I'll tell you some lies<br/>
Got nothin' to lose<br/>
So you just sing the blues all the time<br/>
Gave you my heart<br/>
Gave you my soul<br/>
You left me alone here<br/>
With nothing to hold<br/>
Yesterday's gone<br/>
Now all I want is a smile</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">First, they say they want you<br/>
How they really need you<br/>
Suddenly you find you're out there<br/>
Walking in a storm<br/>
When they know they have you<br/>
Then they really have you<br/>
Nothing you can do or say<br/>
You've got to leave, just get away<br/>
We all know the song</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">You need what you need<br/>
You can say what you want<br/>
Not much you can do<br/>
When the feeling is gone<br/>
May be blue skies above<br/>
But it's cold when you love's on the rocks</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">First, they say they want you<br/>
How they really need you<br/>

Walking in a storm<br/>
When they know they have you<br/>
Then they really have you<br/>
Nothing you can do or say<br/>
You've got to leave, just get away<br/>
We all know the song</p>
