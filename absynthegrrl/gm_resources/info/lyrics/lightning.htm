<p class="regtxt5">1952 Vincent Black Lightning Lyrics</p>
<p class="regtxt5">by Richard Thompson</p>
<p class="regtxt5">From his album, "Rumor and Sigh"</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Says Red Molly, to James, "Well that's a fine motorbike.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A girl could feel special on any such like."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Says James, to Red Molly, "My hat's off to you.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It's a Vincent Black Lightning, 1952.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And I've seen you on the corners and cafes, it seems.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Red hair and black leather, my favorite color scheme."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And he pulled her on behind,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And down to Boxhill,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They'd Ride.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Says James, to Red Molly, "Here's a ring for your right hand.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But I'll tell you in earnest I'm a dangerous man;</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For I've fought with the law since I was seventeen.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I've robbed many a man to get my Vincent machine.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And now I'm twenty-one years, I might make twenty-two.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And I don't mind dyin' but for the love of you.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But if fate should break my stride, then I'll give you my Vincent,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To Ride."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">"Come down Red Molly," called Sargent McQuade.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"For they've taken young James Aidee for Armed Robbery.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shotgun blast hit his chest, left nothing inside.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Oh, come down, Red Molly, to his dying bedside."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When she came to the hospital, there wasn't much left.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He was runnin' out of road. He was runnin' out of breath.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But he smiled, to see her cry.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And said, "I'll give you my Vincent.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To Ride."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Said James, "In my opinion, there's nothing in this world</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Beats a '52 Vincent and a Redheaded girl.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Now Nortons and Indians and Greavses won't do.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Oh, they don't have a Soul like a Vincent '52."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Well he reached for her hand and he slipped her the keys.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He said, "I've got no further use...for these.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I see Angels on Ariels in leather and chrome,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Swoopin' down from Heaven to carry me home."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And he gave her one last kiss and died.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And he gave her his Vincent.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To Ride.</p>
