<p class="pagecaption">Telegraph Road - Dire Straights</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A long time ago came a man on a track</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And he put down his load where he thought it was the best</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He made a home in the wilderness</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He built a cabin and a winter store</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And he ploughed up the ground by the cold lake shore</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And the other travellers came riding down the track</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And they never went further, they never went back</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Then came the churches, then came the schools</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Then came the lawyers, then came the rules</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And the dirty old track was the telegraph road</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Then came the mines - then came the ore</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Then there was the hard times then there was a war</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Telegraph sang a song about the world outside</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Telegraph road got so deep and so wide</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Like a rolling river</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze</p>
<p class="regtxt5">People driving home from the factories</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They've got six lanes of traffic</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Three lanes moving slow</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">I used to like to go to work but they shut it all down</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I've got a right to go to work no work here to be found</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Yes and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Well all the birds up on the wires and up one the poles</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They can always fly away from this rain and this cold</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You can hear them singing out their telegraph code</p>
<p class="regtxt5">All the way down the telegraph road</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">You know I'd sooner forget but I remember those nights</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When life was just a bet on a race between the lights</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You had your head on my shoulder and your hand in my hair</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Now you act a little colder like you don't seem to care</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But believe in me baby and I'll take you away</p>
<p class="regtxt5">From out of this darkness and into the day</p>
<p class="regtxt5">From these rivers of headlights from these rivers of rain</p>
<p class="regtxt5">From the anger that lives on the streets with these names</p>
<p class="regtxt5">'cos I've run every red light on memory lane</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I've seen desperation explode into flames</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And I don't wanna see it again</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">From all of these signs saying sorry but we're closed</p>
<p class="regtxt5">All the way down the telegraph road</p>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>
