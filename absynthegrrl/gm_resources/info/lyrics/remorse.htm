<p class="pagecaption">Remorse - Bella Morte</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He stands in the chill of night</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With snow swirling down</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Memories lurking in his eyes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Blood is on his hands</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She still lives inside of him</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She still holds his eyes in thrall</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She still softly sings to him</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And she still owns his soul</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And he will live forever more</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The walls of his world crashing down</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Alone in the dark</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The walls of his world crashing down</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shadows in his mind</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The walls of his world crashing down</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sanity has gone</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Tears of blood roll down his cheeks</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As she cried his name</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Trapped he stood and watched her fall</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Screaming in the rain</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He still hears her crying there</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sees her pictures on the wall</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He still sees her lying there</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And he still hears her call</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Walls of white and silken sheets</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Line his padded cell</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Far beyond the metal door</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Eternity his hall</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Well, they did not understand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When he cried out her name</p>
<p class="regtxt5">No, they did not understand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Death was the only way</p>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>
