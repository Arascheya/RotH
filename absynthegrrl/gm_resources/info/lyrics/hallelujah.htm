<p class="pagecaption">Hallelujah</p>
<p class="regtxt5">written by Leonard Cohen</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now I've heard there was a secret chord<br/>
That David played, and it pleased the Lord<br/>
But you don't really care for music, do you?<br/>
It goes like this<br/>
The fourth, the fifth<br/>
The minor fall, the major lift<br/>
The baffled king composing Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Your faith was strong but you needed proof<br/>
You saw her bathing on the roof<br/>
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you<br/>
She tied you<br/>
To a kitchen chair<br/>
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair<br/>
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Baby I have been here before<br/>
I know this room, I've walked this floor<br/>
I used to live alone before I knew you.<br/>
I've seen your flag on the marble arch<br/>
Love is not a victory march<br/>
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was a time you let me know<br/>
What's really going on below<br/>
But now you never show it to me, do you?<br/>
And remember when I moved in you<br/>
The holy dove was moving too<br/>
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You say I took the name in vain<br/>
I don't even know the name<br/>
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?<br/>
There's a blaze of light<br/>
In every word<br/>
It doesn't matter which you heard<br/>
The holy or the broken Hallelujah</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I did my best, it wasn't much<br/>
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch<br/>
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you<br/>
And even though<br/>
It all went wrong<br/>
I'll stand before the Lord of Song<br/>
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah</p>
