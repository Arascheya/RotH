<p class="pagecaption">A Tale They Won't Believe</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We left Macquarie Harbour it was in the pouring rain</p>
<p class="regtxt5">none of us quite sure if we would see England again</p>
<p class="regtxt5">some fool muttered death or liberty</p>
<p class="regtxt5">there was six of us together a jolly hungry crew</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and as the days went by you know our hunger quickly grew</p>
<p class="regtxt5">some fool muttered death or liberty</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">So that night we made fires out of twigs and out of bark</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and our stomachs they were grumbling all through the night so dark</p>
<p class="regtxt5">we were only trying to keep ourselves alive</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but when the sun came up next morning well the six had turned to five</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And I said, right there's another one, don't you frown,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Chew the meat and hold it down, It's a tale they won't believe,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When I get down to Hobart town</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">All five of us were nervous and I'll tell you that's a fact</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but you should have seen the bastard who was carrying the axe</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He was a sick man he had murder in his heart</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And then we reached the Franklin River, and it took two days to cross</p>
<p class="regtxt5">we were wet and almost starvin' and for food were at a loss</p>
<p class="regtxt5">we were hungry men with murder on our minds.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">So that night we made a fire out of twigs and out of bark</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and our stomachs they were rumbling all through the night so dark,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And they were making noises the dead could not ignore</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and when the sun came up next morning,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the five had turned to four!</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And I said, right there's another one, don't you frown,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Chew the meat and hold it down, It's a tale they won't believe,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When I get down to Hobart town</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Well the four of us kept marching to a place called Western Teirs</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A country full of tasty game but for us it held no cheer</p>
<p class="regtxt5">we had no guns we were traveling without hope.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But the axe it loomed so ominous and God's hand was at play</p>
<p class="regtxt5">a sick man is a type of game which can not run away</p>
<p class="regtxt5">so stay easy, my poor man, your time's at hand.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">So that night we made fires out of twigs and out of bark</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and our stomachs they were grumbling all through the night so dark</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I can't say I feel guilty, after all it wasn't me</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but when the sun came up next morning the four had turned to three</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And I said, right there's another one, don't you frown,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Chew the meat and hold it down, It's a tale they won't believe,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When I get down to Hobart town</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">well the three of us kept moving but one was fading fast</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he had been bitten by a snake and you could see he would not last</p>
<p class="regtxt5">stay easy my good man your time is at hand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and when he could last no longer his days were fading fast</p>
<p class="regtxt5">we were far to weak to carry him subsistency comes first</p>
<p class="regtxt5">stay easy my good man your time is at hand</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">So that night we made fires out of twigs and out of bark</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and our stomachs  they were grumbling all through the night so dark</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was a messy job but it was one we had to do</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but when the sun came up next morning the three had turned to two</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And I said, right there's another one, don't you frown,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Chew the meat and hold it down, It's a tale they won't believe,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When I get down to Hobart town</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Now he had been looking at me funny, sort of eyeing me for days,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And you would not need to be too bright to know that bastard's ways:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He was a sick man, he had murder in his heart.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But even bastards have to rest, and even bastards have to sleep,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And when he was in the land of Nod straight over I did creep,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and the axe that he had wielded now was mine.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">So that night, I made the fire, out of twigs and out of bark,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and my stomach it kept rumbling all through the night so dark.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I can't say that I enjoyed it, and it wasn't exactly fun,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but when the sun came up next morning, the two had turned to one!</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And I said, right there's another one, don't you frown,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Chew the meat and hold it down, It's a tale they won't believe,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When I get down to Hobart town</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Well now history is a pack of lies, as any fool can tell,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">So when I got down to Hobart town I told my story well,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But do you think they would believe one word I said?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For they thought that I was covering for my mates still at large,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Said they'd be roaming in the bush so wild and free,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And back to old Macquarie Harbour they sent me</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">But I remember the fires made out of twigs and made of bark</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and my stomach it was grumbling all through the night so dark</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And this young fool he just said to me it's liberty or death</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and he looked a rather tasty one, I just could not help it singing</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And I said, right there's another one, don't you frown,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Chew the meat and hold it down, It's a tale they won't believe</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When I get down to Hobart town</p>
