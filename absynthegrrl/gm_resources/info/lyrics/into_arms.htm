<p class="pagecaption">Into My Arms Lyrics - Nick Cave - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8owifmb8n2s&feature=related">YouTube</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">I don't believe in an interventionist God<br/>
But I know, darling, that you do<br/>
But if I did I would kneel down and ask Him<br/>
Not to intervene when it came to you<br/>
Not to touch a hair on your head<br/>
To leave you as you are<br/>
And if He felt He had to direct you<br/>
Then direct you into my arms</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Into my arms, O Lord<br/>
Into my arms, O Lord<br/>
Into my arms, O Lord<br/>
Into my arms</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And I don't believe in the existence of angels<br/>
But looking at you I wonder if that's true<br/>
But if I did I would summon them together<br/>
And ask them to watch over you<br/>
To each burn a candle for you<br/>
To make bright and clear your path<br/>
And to walk, like Christ, in grace and love<br/>
And guide you into my arms</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Into my arms, O Lord<br/>
Into my arms, O Lord<br/>
Into my arms, O Lord<br/>
Into my arms</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And I believe in Love<br/>
And I know that you do too<br/>
And I believe in some kind of path<br/>
That we can walk down, me and you<br/>
So keep your candlew burning<br/>
And make her journey bright and pure<br/>
That she will keep returning<br/>
Always and evermore</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Into my arms, O Lord<br/>
Into my arms, O Lord<br/>
Into my arms, O Lord<br/>
Into my arms</p>
