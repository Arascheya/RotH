<p class="regtxt5">Scary Bitches</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Well I never thought that I could hate anybody<br/>
As much as I hate you<br/>
You used to be my friend 'till you ran off with my lover<br/>
Now you've gone off with somebody new</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bridge: If we ever were to meet in the street<br/>
        I wouldn't have a lot to say<br/>
        But every night before I go to sleep<br/>
        I get down on my knees and pray</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And this is what I say;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Chorus: I hope you die young<br/>
        I hope you die in pain<br/>
        Hope you die alone in the pouring rain<br/>
        I hope you die cold and empty inside<br/>
        They send you to hell on the other side<br/>
        I hope you die young<br/>
        I hope you die in pain<br/>
        Hope you die alone and half insane<br/>
        And I hope that I'm still alive so I can<br/>
        Dance and sing and Piss all over your grave!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Well I've got a little doll, I gave it your name<br/>
I stick pins in it just to cause you pain<br/>
This morning I crushed its head in a vice<br/>
You've turned me into someone that's not very nice</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Remember when I cooked you beef curry for tea?<br/>
Well I hope it was infected with B.S.E.<br/>
'Cause nothing would give more pleasure to me<br/>
Than to watch you slowly die from C.J.D.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Chorus (x2)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And I hope that I'm still alive so I can<br/>
Dance and sing and Piss all over your grave! (x2)</p>
