<p class="pagecaption">String of Pearls - Soul Asylum</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She swings the string of pearls on the corner</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The street lights reflect the light in the water</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The string it snaps and the pearls go sailing</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And they splash and bounce and roll 'cross the wet street</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">As she bends to chase the pearls a car swings 'round the corner</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She darts from the eyes of the panic-struck driver</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Who's racing to the delivery room</p>
<p class="regtxt5">'Cause in the back seat his wife is busting out of her womb</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And the sack breaks and out come the Siamese Twins</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Who grow up to become the first President</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With two heads</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Are better than one</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">He puts his heads in his hands, says I got to put my heads together</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I can become the best President ever</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And not just President</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Fend for yourself</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Signs his name, takes the blame for all of the names with no shame</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In their beliefs</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They adjourn and they leave, and in walks a man</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With a broom and a knife and blood on his hands</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And he sweeps everything under the rug</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And goes home to his kids and gives them a hug</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But his wife was not there, she had just left a letter</p>
<p class="regtxt5">That said "you'd be much better off without me"</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Now his wife took the train to her ex-lover's funeral</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Who died in the bathroom, hit his head on a urinal</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When they got together, the knowledge was carnal</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And the widow was at the funeral, and they had quite a catfight</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And they fell into the hole where the casket was resting</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And the preacher just left in the middle of the service</p>
<p class="regtxt5">'Cause death was one thing, but women made him nervous</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And he ran to his car and he drove 'round the corner</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Then something in the street caught the light in his eye</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He pulled over, reached down, and picked up a pearl from the gutter</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And he didn't know what to think</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And he brought it home and washed it in the sink</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">And he gave the pearl to Sister Mary Teresa</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Who could not accept it so she gave it to Lisa,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A young prostitute who was missing a pearl</p>
<p class="regtxt5">On the necklace that broke late last night</p>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>
