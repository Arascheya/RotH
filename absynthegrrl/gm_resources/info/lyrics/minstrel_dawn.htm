<p class="regtxt5">If you could read my mind love, what a tale my thoughts could tell</p>
<p class="regtxt5">just like an old time movie 'bout a ghost from a wishing well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">in a castle dark or a fortress strong with chains upon my feet</p>
<p class="regtxt5">you know that ghost is me and I will never be set free</p>
<p class="regtxt5">as long as I'm a ghost that you can't see</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">If I could read your mind love, what a tale your thoughts could tell</p>
<p class="regtxt5">just like a paperback novel, the kind that drugstores sell</p>
<p class="regtxt5">when you reach the part where the heartaches come</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the hero would be me the hero often fails</p>
<p class="regtxt5">you won't read that book again because the ending's just too hard to take</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">I'd walk away like a movie star</p>
<p class="regtxt5">who gets burned in a three way script into number two</p>
<p class="regtxt5">a movie queen to play the scene</p>
<p class="regtxt5">of bringing all the good things out in me</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but for now love I never thought I could act this way</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and I've got to say that I just don't get it</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I don't know where we went wrong</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but the feelings gone and I just can't get it back</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If you could read my mind love,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">what a tale my thoughts could tell</p>
<p class="regtxt5">just like an old time movie 'bout a ghost from a wishing well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">in a castle dark or a fortress strong with chains upon my feet</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the story always ends if you read between the lines</p>
<p class="regtxt5">you'll know I'm just trying to understand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the feelings that you lack</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I never thought I could act this way</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and I've got to say that I just don't get it</p>
