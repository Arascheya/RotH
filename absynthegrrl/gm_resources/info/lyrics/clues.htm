<p class="pagecaption">Too Many Clues In This Room  (Summertime Dream) 4:57</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The space shuttle ends where the subway begins</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There's a tear on the face of the moon</p>
<p class="regtxt5">From dusk until dawn they have searched all day long</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But there's too many clues in this room</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At best it is said we've been locked deep inside</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Of an old sea man's chest full of charts</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Where maps are contained and what's left of his brains</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When his crew threw his balls to the sharks</p>
<p class="regtxt5">All around the looking glass</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dancing to a tune</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sweeping out the house with a fine tooth comb</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Which history's shown</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Leads to ruin</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">In a word it is said that at times we must fall</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But the worst of it all was the lies</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We died for the cause just like regular outlaws</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In the dust of an old lawman's eyes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In times best forgot there was peace there was not</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In her pains mother earth came to bloom</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her children were born in the eye of the storm</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And there's too many clues in this room</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The power that is stored in this no man's land of chance</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Is the someone who knows what they're doin'</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The old soldiers say in they're own crusty way</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We've got too many troops in this room</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">All around the looking glass</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dancing to a tune</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sweeping out the house with a fine tooth comb</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Which history's shown</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Leads to ruin</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The space shuttle ends where the subway begins</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Praise the lord there's a train leavin' soon</p>
<p class="regtxt5">From dusk until dawn they have searched all day long</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But there's too many clues in this room</p>
