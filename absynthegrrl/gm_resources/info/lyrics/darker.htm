<p class="pagecaption">Darker Than This - Spike's Song</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Marysia</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Story Behind the Song:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">This song was written about Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and his obsession with the Slayer, inspired in particular by the episode Fool For Love. It was recorded live in July 2001 using what crude methods and bad guitar playing were available to me :)</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Dark, so much darker than this.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I'm trying to find a way close to you,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Cannot get close to you</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soon, it gets darker than this.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I just wanted a word from you,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tried to believe in you</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Thought about changing the world,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">About changing my world,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aabout changing for you</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Begged you to show me the way,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Just to ask me to stay,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But you never would</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">CH: And you won't leave me alone,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Won't let me go free, I need to go home</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But I don't know anymore,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">where it is I belong, when my heart...</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Dark, need to bleed you all dry</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Need to rip out your heart, but I can't see you cry</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I'll beg you to show me the way,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And you'll stand there amazed and you won't hear a word I say</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I've changed, and I did it for you,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">But you won't let me find a way close to you,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Cannot get close to you</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soon, it grows darker than this,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Always darker than this</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And I am just dreaming my death away,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dreaming your life away</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">-Chorus-</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Lost, I'm a fool for your love</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Never learned how to play, only know how to fight</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I tried, though I knew I would lose</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Threw my old life aside and I asked you to choose</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And now it grows darker than this</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Cause you won't let me find a way close to you</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Cannot get close to you</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soon I'll be colder than this</p>
<p class="regtxt5">So much older than this</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And then I'll be draining your soul away</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Able to walk away</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">-Chorus-</p>
