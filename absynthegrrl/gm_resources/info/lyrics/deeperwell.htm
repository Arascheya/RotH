The sun burned hot, it burned my eyes<br/>
Burned so hot I thought I'd died<br/>
Thought I'd died and gone to hell<br/>
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well<br/>
I went to the river but the river was dry<br/>
I fell to my knees an I looked to the sky<br/>
I looked to the sky and the spring rain fell<br/>
I saw the water from a deeper well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">
Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well<br/>
Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">
I was ready for love I was ready for the money<br/>
Ready for the blood and ready for the honey<br/>
Ready for the winnin', ready for the bell<br/>
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well<br/>
I found some love and I found some money<br/>
Found that blood would drip from the honey<br/>
Found I had a thirst that I could not quell<br/>
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">
Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well<br/>
Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">
Well I did it for kicks and I did it for faith<br/>
I did it for lust and I did it for hate<br/>
I did it for need and I did it for love<br/>
Addiction stayed on tight like a glove<br/>
So I ran with the moon and I ran with the night<br/>
And the three of us were a terrible sight<br/>
Nipple to the bottle to the gun to the cell<br/>
To the bottom of a hole of a deeper well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">
Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well<br/>
Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">
I rocked with the cradle and I rolled with the rage<br/>
I shook those walls and I rattled that gage<br/>
I took my trouble down a deadend trail<br/>
Reachin' out a hand for a holier grail<br/>
Hey there mama did you carry that load<br/>
Did you tell your baby 'bout the bend in the road<br/>
'Bout the rebel yell 'bout the one that fell<br/>
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">
Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well<br/>
Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well</p>
