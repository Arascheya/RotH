<p class="regtxt5">Take a little walk to the edge of town<br/>
Go across the tracks<br/>
Where the viaduct looms,<br/>
like a bird of doom<br/>
As it shifts and cracks<br/>
Where secrets lie in the border fires,<br/>
in the humming wires<br/>
Hey man, you know<br/>
you're never coming back<br/>
Past the square, past the bridge,<br/>
past the mills, past the stacks<br/>
On a gathering storm comes<br/>
a tall handsome man<br/>
In a dusty black coat with<br/>
a red right hand</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He'll wrap you in his arms,<br/>
tell you that you've been a good boy<br/>
He'll rekindle all the dreams<br/>
it took you a lifetime to destroy<br/>
He'll reach deep into the hole,<br/>
heal your shrinking soul<br/>
But there won't be a single thing<br/>
That you can do.<br/>
He's a god, he's a man,<br/>
he's a ghost, he's a guru<br/>
They're whispering his name<br/>
through this disappearing land<br/>
But hidden in his coat<br/>
is a red right hand</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You ain't got no money?<br/>
He'll get you some<br/>
You ain't got no car?<br/>
He'll get you one<br/>
You ain't have no self-respect,<br/>
you feel like an insect<br/>
Well don't you worry buddy,<br/>
cause here he comes<br/>
Through the ghettos and the barrio<br/>
and the bowery and the slum<br/>
A shadow is cast wherever he stands<br/>
Stacks of green paper in his<br/>
red right hand</p>

<p class="regtxt5">(Organ solo)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You'll see him in your nightmares,<br/>
you'll see him in your dreams<br/>
He'll appear out of nowhere but<br/>
he ain't what he seems<br/>
You'll see him in your head,<br/>
on the TV screen<br/>
And hey buddy, I'm warning<br/>
you to turn it off<br/>
He's a ghost, he's a god,<br/>
he's a man, he's a guru<br/>
You're one microscopic cog<br/>
in his catastrophic plan<br/>
Designed and directed by<br/>
his red right hand</p>
