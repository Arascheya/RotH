<p class="pagecaption">Angel from Montgomery</p>

<p class="regtxt5">John Prine</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I am an old woman named after my mother<br/>
My old man is another child that's grown old<br/>
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire<br/>
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Chorus:<br/>
Make me an angel that flies from montgom'ry<br/>
Make me a poster of an old rodeo<br/>
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to<br/>
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy<br/>
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man<br/>
But that was a long time and no matter how I try<br/>
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Repeat chorus:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing<br/>
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.<br/>
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning<br/>
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Repeat chorus:</p>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>
