<p class="regtxt5">/* concept - suicide of sorts, called back by Mistress von Fronkonstien, did she come back willingly? what was it like on the other side? - this is the opening piece for Love's Bitch at the Cathouse */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Nausea sings the part of the resurrected victim</p>
<p class="regtxt5">victim wasn't in hell like the resurrector thought, she was in a peaceful limbo and not very happy being brought back. by the end of the song there needs to be a truce, an understanding that the victim will not opt out again immediately. this is a lvoe song, but for a disfunctional couple where the end of the song isn't happily ever after</p>
