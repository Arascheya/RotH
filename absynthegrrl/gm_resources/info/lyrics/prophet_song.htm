<p class="regtxt5">Oh Oh people of the earth<br/>
listen to the warning the seer she said<br/>
Beware the storm that gathers here<br/>
Listen to the wise one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair<br/>
Spreading her hands on the multitude there<br/>
Woman who cried for a love gone stale<br/>
And ice cold hearts of charity bare.<br/>
I watched as fear took the old one's gaze<br/>
Hopes of the young in troubled graves<br/>
I see no day, I heard her say<br/>
So grey is the face of every mortal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oh Oh people of the earth<br/>
Listen to the warning<br/>
The prophetess said<br/>
For soon the cold of night will fall<br/>
Summoned by your own hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oh Oh children of the land<br/>
Quicken to the new life<br/>
Take my hand<br/>
Fly and find the new green bough<br/>
Return like the white dove.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She told of death as a bone white haze<br/>
Taking the lost and the unloved babe<br/>
Late too late all the wretches run<br/>
These kings of beasts now counting their days.<br/>
From mother's love is the son estranged<br/>
Married his own his precious gain<br/>
The earth will shake in two will break<br/>
And death all around will be your dow'ry</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oh Oh people of the earth<br/>
Listen to the warning the seer she said<br/>
For those who hear and mark my words<br/>
Listen to the good plan.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oh Oh - and two by two my human zoo<br/>
They'll be<br/>
running for to come<br/>
running for to come<br/>
out of the rain</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Flee for your life<br/>
Who head me not,<br/>
let all your treasure make you<br/>
Fear for you life<br/>
Deceive you not<br/>
the fires of hell will take you<br/>
Should death await you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gods give you grace<br/>
to purge this place<br/>
And peace all around<br/>
may be your fortune.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oh Oh children of the land<br/>
Love is still the answer, take my hand<br/>
The vision fades, a voice I hear<br/>
"Listen to the Mad One!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">But still I fear and still not dare<br/>
Laugh at the Mad One.</p>
