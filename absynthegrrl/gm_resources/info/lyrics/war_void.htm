<p class="pagecaption">War in the Void</p>
<p class="regtxt5">now its just my luck to have the watch with nothing left to do</p>
<p class="regtxt5">watch the empty scanners  as we patrol along our route</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and wonder when they'll come again and pitch us to the war</p>
<p class="regtxt5">whirl off one more youngster in the void</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">the kid was so damn eager, it was all so big and new</p>
<p class="regtxt5">you never had to tell him twice or find him work to do</p>
<p class="regtxt5">evenings on the mess deck he was always first to sing</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and show us pictures of the girl he'd met in spring</p>
<p class="regtxt5">REFRAIN</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt9">REFRAIN</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but I told that kid a hundred times</p>
<p class="regtxt5">don't take your kills for granted</p>
<p class="regtxt5">they'll turn on you and shoot you down</p>
<p class="regtxt5">so fast they'd seem enchanted</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but tonight some red eyed Zeltrop girl</p>
<p class="regtxt5">lies staring at the wall</p>
<p class="regtxt5">for her lover's gone into the Great Void.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">now its a thing that us old timers know</p>
<p class="regtxt5">in the lazy peaceful calm</p>
<p class="regtxt5">there comes a ship from nowhere</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and it hits us like a bomb</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and a fifteen thousand tonner</p>
<p class="regtxt5">can be thrown upon her beam</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and a battle cruiser can be shredded by their beams</p>
<p class="regtxt5">while the void takes all into it with a scream</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">the kid was on the fringes sitting staring at the stars</p>
<p class="regtxt5">from where I flew I swear I could see</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the tears fall from his eyes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">so I hadn't the heart to tell him</p>
<p class="regtxt5">he should be on a line</p>
<p class="regtxt5">even on a flight so close to home</p>
<p class="regtxt5">REFRAIN</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">when they struck he sat up with a start</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I roared to him break left</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but for all that he could hear me</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I could as well not made a sound</p>
<p class="regtxt5">so I broke right to go assist and felt my face go pale</p>
<p class="regtxt5">as franticaly he dodged the volley</p>
<p class="regtxt5">now I could see her swinging round</p>
<p class="regtxt5">to bring the mains on line</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I watched his ship exploding so terrible and slow</p>
<p class="regtxt5">then like some great bear they turned and roared at us again</p>
<p class="regtxt5">while over the com I heard him call my name</p>
<p class="regtxt5">REFRAIN</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">now its just my luck to have the watch</p>
<p class="regtxt5">with nothing left to do</p>
<p class="regtxt5">watch the empty scanners</p>
<p class="regtxt5">as we patrol along our route</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and wonder when they'll come again</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and pitch us to the war</p>
<p class="regtxt5">whirl off one more youngster in the void</p>
<p class="regtxt5">and I tell these kids...REFRAIN</p>
