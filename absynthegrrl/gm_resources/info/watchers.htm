<p class="pagecaption">Council of Watchers</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Exists to provide support to the current Slayer. The council gathers information, weapons, and majik items necessary for the Slayer to perform her duties. They also provide cover stories and other smoke screens to keep the Slayer/Demon battles out of the public eye.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The council is headquartered in London and membership is by recommendation from existing members. There are several layers of access to the data maintained by the council. There are researchers and other positions that know little of the Slayer and the actual battles occuring. There are members who know most of the activities going on, and then there are the actual sitting council members who make the decisions about what the Slayer's current task will be.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In 1890's London council members include such varied persons as Bram Stoker, Abraham von Helsing, and several other well placed British citizens. Jonathan Harker will likely be asked to join once he returns from Transylvania.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The watchers evolved from those around the First One when she was chosen. Over the years they have desired and attained greater control over the slayer. They now view themselves as the logical repository of knowledge and control over the slayer and will take extreme measures to retain that control. They are not unhappy that slayers don’t last long.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is an inner council, composed of 15 members, that oversees the entire council operation. They are under the influence of an external agency that is using them to promote its own agenda. At the moment this agenda aligns strongly with the Cthulian Gate crowd. The slayers are kept pointed away from any of the Cthulian events. Maria and Robert may learn of this. Angelique may also know of this.</p>
