<p class="regtxt5">Game production company in the middle of the Meriksas. They are known for Conflict for Mars and the Shadow Journey games. Currently they are working as a contractor for Rani Corp on <a href="roth.htm">Realms of the Hut.</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">CyCore games is located near <a href="../places/waverlys.htm">Waverly's Pub</a>. They rent the offices from Tom O'Malley and later Irena.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Forever City, one of the episodes of the <a href="shadow_journeys.htm">Shadow Journey</a> games, came with a world editor. Forever City started as a single player game, then became episode 1 of the online Shadow World series. The world editor was modified to support the online model of the Shadow Journey games. It was easy to use, supported a rich and powerful editing environment and allowed Shadow Journeysto become the most modded game series of all time. Forever City takes place in a hive city, think Kowloon Walled City on steroids, and follows the path of a kid growing up in the lower sections. Jaime will want to borrow heavily from Forever City for a location in Realms of the Hut. The game was formative for her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The world editor of Forever City is one of the assets Jaime wants to use in Realms of the Hut.</p>
