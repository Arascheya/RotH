<p class="regtxt5">Gracie Sport Gear was founded by Maluhia Jessica (MJ) Montoz, using funds from her surf winnings, her parents, and the Finleys. She started it as an islands only source for more stylish surf gear for women. She started with a single shop at the Royal Wahaiian in Lanahua. The items sold were produced in the Montoz and Finley homes, until they had to hire more help and lease production space. Her designs became an instant favorite with the local surfers and the younger tourists.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gracie shops were opened on the north shore and on Kuawa. Expansion accelerated once an employee talked her into an online presence. This led to franchises in surf spots world wide. Once the online expansion started, Gracie received requests to provide sport gear for other sports. They now have full lines of ski wear, everyday wear, swim wear, kids lines, footwear, and accessories, all made for the woman athlete.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gracie is a major sponsor of women's surfing and of the women's contests at Eku.</p>
