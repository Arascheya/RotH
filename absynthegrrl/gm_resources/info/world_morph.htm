<p class="pagecaption">World Morphers Inc.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is an umbrella company for handling various Imperium construction needs. It is a quasi-clandestin group. They will hire workers from various locations, transport them to the construction site, then return them when the job is over. The workers aren't told where they are working or what the purposes are. Once finished they are paid well and told to remain silent.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This company was established before Valen came to power however it was rarely used. Valen transformed them into a profitable group and encouraged them to branch out into fully legitimate projects as a cover. They were the prime contractor on the Karanal project.</p>
