<p class="pagecaption">Gate Dimension</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Gate Dimension is the place traveled through to go from one <a href="../gates_inx.htm">Gate</a> to the next. It is a featureless shifting void of greyish green shadows and swirling patterns. To cross successfully to the next Gate, the guide must concentrate as fully as possible on the appearance of the target gate and location. The more perfect the visualization, the more likely the guide is to emerge through the correct gate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Magical or Technological items will allow direct linking from one Gate to another. Travel actually occurs through the Gate Dimension, but the user is unaware of it as the travel is very nearly instant. These Gate Items are rare and costly. There is usually a chance they will not remain with the user after the journey. Arcanes can achieve a similar result through high level magical spells. Lower level 'teleport' spells use the Gate linkages on a world to transmit the target(s) from one nearby Gate Node to another one close to the destination and then to the destination.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All gates in the multi-verse interact with the Gate Dimension. No gate can be formed directly between locations without this interaction. This is a deliberate "patch" to the multi-verse, put in place by the <a href="3sisters.htm">Sisters</a> near the dawn of time. The patch was necessitated after a very bad gate creation incident started a destructive chain reaction in a segment of the multi-verse. When gates were opened directly between Realms, an energy differential could exist. The greater this differential, the more energy and material would by syphoned through the gate, to attempt to balance the difference. The Gate Dimension was formed as a buffer to this effect, balancing the imbalances at the gate interfaces and preventing catastrophic events.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some believe <a href="../npcs/ishra.htm">Ishra</a>, The Web Queen, came into being as part of the multi-versal patch. This is true, to a point. Ishra was on the Realm that punched the problem gate and was sucked through along with the rest of the Realm. When the patch was created she was "Uplifted" to Sisterhood. Many of the beings from her world mutated into the void creatures that wander the Gate Dimension. Even <a href="3sisters.htm">The Sisters</a> aren't sure why Ishra ended up Uplifted instead of just another Gate Dimension being, with a finite life-sapan. Balance, in particular, has become a good friend of Ishra over the milenia since the event.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Permanent Gates appear as "dimples" in the fabric of the Gate Dimension. They are usually clustered in a circle of 7, with an entry pathway to the center of the circle where the dimples decend from.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prolonged exposure to the Gate Dimension will result in deformation of the mind and body of the traveler. These changes become more pronounced with each exposure until a stable point is reached. This is usually calculated as CON+1d6 exposures before it begins to manifest and stability is reached after 1d6 adjustments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These effects will fade slowly if the victim refrains from using any World Gate or related majik for one month for each time through a Gate. Any travel through any Gate will immediately reset the clock on the recovery process, reverting the changee back to fully changed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These distortions will be both physical and mental. In all cases there will be a balance of positive abilities conferred as well as negative effects and appearances. Some examples are listed below.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Aggressive - always battle-ready</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Timid, Retreating</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Scheming - always tries to manipulate or achieve goals through the most convoluted manner possible</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dishonest, Deceitful</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dense, Oblivious</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Covetous, Greedy</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Cruel - in a petty, annoyingly hurtful kind of way. Truly Cruel beings will be warped and twisted in much more severe ways, severe enough that Kayara will abandon them to the Gate Dimension if she doesn't out-right kill them.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Passionate, Led By Emotion</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Unflappable - calm in any occurrence</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dispassionate, Emotionless - cold, calculating, analytical</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dull, "Average" - unremarkable in any way, although may have some physical attribute that would need to be concealed if they were to be used for infiltration</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Gate Dimension is home to many creatures. Some very peaceful, others that are always hungry. These mutated from original plants and animals sucked into the proto-void that existed at the time of the multiversal patch.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Creatures</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Void Worms</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Accolytes of Ishra</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Beings descended from the TruSpiders sucked through the tear with Ishra. They have mutated and grown in power as they have lived in the Gate Dimension. Most remain with Ishra at the Center of the Webs, however, a few venture out into the void or step into realms, eager for new experiences. <a href="../npcs/talia_a.htm">Talia</a>'s mom is one of the adventurous ones. They are humanoid, with large, webbed hands and feet, allowing them to swim through the dimension similar to the void worms.</p>
