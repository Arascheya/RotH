AbsyntheGrrl: multiple -attachments: if this can take a 
week or two to come on-line i can write an add-in to 
handle this it will take this time to make sure the 
multi-attachment add-in doesn't break single images that 
have already been uploaded.
Devious Girlsz: ?
Devious Girlsz: come again?
AbsyntheGrrl: multiple images per post - if that is a 
desired behavior - and if you haven't found the add-in 
mod you were using before
Devious Girlsz: hmm...
Devious Girlsz: we can re submitt the previous images.
Devious Girlsz: If we know where they are.
Devious Girlsz: each post,
Devious Girlsz: moderators can edit.
Devious Girlsz: at least, I can.
AbsyntheGrrl: true enough - i believe they ended up in 
the uploads folder...
Devious Girlsz: but...
Devious Girlsz: when you click it,
Devious Girlsz: you get an error?
Devious Girlsz: are they even in the uploads folder?
Devious Girlsz: or did they get wiped somehow?
AbsyntheGrrl: i'm not sure - i  thought they were - but 
having not seen them, ever i can't say for certain - just 
that there seemed to be quite a few images in there...
AbsyntheGrrl: more images than it seemed were 
showing in existing topics
AbsyntheGrrl: what gets written would work going 
forward - recovery would require the re-posting you are 
describing
Devious Girlsz: I can have my boy to the tedious work. 
:P
AbsyntheGrrl: the design parameters would be: for 
display: check for multiple images - display them, check 
for single image, display it
AbsyntheGrrl: design for posting: present multiple post 
section of dialog - up to ten say - process and store each
AbsyntheGrrl: for admin: add a switch to the control 
panel to turn off multiple file posting if desired - turning 
off multiple images would not kill display of existing 
multiple images in their existing posts - it would just make 
all new posts single image
Devious Girlsz: ok, check it out...
Devious Girlsz: can u make it so...
Devious Girlsz: when someone posts an image, a 
thumbnail goes to a external page?
Devious Girlsz: like deviantARK
Devious Girlsz: It goes to the front page.
AbsyntheGrrl: possibly - i will need to see where/how 
the post thumbnail is getting created and see if it can be 
copied to file at the same time - i winder if they are using 
the gallery add-in at deviant?
Devious Girlsz: lol
Devious Girlsz: deviantART is intense coding.
AbsyntheGrrl: they have how many coders working on 
it? seems like a lot from the admin journals...:-)
AbsyntheGrrl: the external page - where/how would 
you see it bening displayed?
Devious Girlsz: 4X4
AbsyntheGrrl: would it hijack part of the forum main 
page or be something seperate?
Devious Girlsz: ...
Devious Girlsz: Sure.
Devious Girlsz: It would be like,...
Devious Girlsz: we'll scratch that.
Devious Girlsz: We'll do that later.
Devious Girlsz: As long as we can change it.
AbsyntheGrrl: we can - especially since we decided to 
allow for it up front - that way the code can be set up 
with this in mind for later
DEV-NOTE:add thumbnail locator field to multi-table - maybe hijack the single image data and replicate it in the multi-table? maybe in single image mode the data is set in the posts table and replicated in the multi table for thumbnail location? need to know where the thumb is, unless set a system var to track where to stash a hard-coded thumb...
Devious Girlsz: cool.
