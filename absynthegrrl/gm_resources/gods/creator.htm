<p class="pagecaption">Creator</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is one of the really early gods. It split from the primal force at the dawn of the current universal age. It is the creative force that balances the destructive force.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At the start of this age it and the destructor were in balance, each one understanding the importance of the other and of a balance between their effects.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As the age progressed each one sought more and more to achieve supremacy in view point. As time went along and various intelligent beings were created and evolved they would attempt to use these for proxy wars.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At last a group of younger gods fought each of these primal powers to a standstill and imprisoned them outside the flow of time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Creator struggles to free itself and create a new group of followers. This time the goal is the destruction of the younger ones and any of their allied creatures. Then it seeks to overwhelm and destroy the Destructor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The exact whereabouts of the Elder Sign sealed gateway to the Creator is not known.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Neither The Creator nor The Destructor realizes that the destruction of the other will doom them both and bring on the next age of the universe. If they are released from imprisonment they will immediately seek each other out and attempt to destroy the other. This will end the multiverse and trigger a new creation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Creator is imprisoned in the center of <a hre="../places/planescape/centrys.htm">The Sphere</a>. She... has set the containment to wax and wain in terms of energy output to provide a night and day cycle to <a hre="../places/planescape/centrys.htm">The Sphere</a>. It is the leakage of creative force that makes <a hre="../places/planescape/centrys.htm">The Sphere</a> the place of such possibility.</p>
