<p class="pagecaption">Lesser Powers - Proxy Gods</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is the way the <a href="younger_gods.htm">Greater Powers</a> - the Younger Gods - refer to the various deities, demi-gods, godlings and such of the sentient races.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is much speculation about the origins of the proxy gods. Some believe they are the coalescing of the religious energies of the race(s) that worship them. In this view the more worshippers feeding energy to the god, the more powerful it is. Others believe they are unintentional fragments from the Greater Powers that broke off during the binding of the <a href="creator.htm">Creator</a> and <a href="destructor.htm">Destructor</a>. Still others believe they are their own entities, formed as a result of the creation of the universe.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The manner of their creation is not important to understanding their role in the <a href="../info/multiverse.htm">multi-verse</a>. Most of them are vain, self centered and interested only in their own glorification. They see the beings worshipping them as ready tools to promote their greatness to the rest of the <a href="../info/multiverse.htm">multi-verse</a>. Typical proxy gods care nothing for the non-sentient life forms nor for the inanimate items of truth, beauty, and art that the sentient races create as part of their life cycles. Their only interest is in gathering as many followers as possible and inspiring these followers to convert or destroy any that do not worship them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are a few exceptions in behavior. Nature gods and goddesses tend to take a more balanced view of the whole situation, only entering into the fray when necessary. There are also a few older Proxy Gods that have risen above the petty squabbles of the majority.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On some level the Proxy Gods know the <a href="younger_gods.htm">Greater Powers</a> can kick their asses, but they also know that as long as the multi-versal balance doesn't get too far out of alignment, the <a href="younger_gods.htm">Greater Powers</a> will probably not interfere.</p>
