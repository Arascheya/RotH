<p class="pagecaption">Razaks - Demons from the Outer Worlds</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They are known mostly from rumors, myths, and legends. These say they are mind eating horrors or worse. They can instill the OneMind kind of situation by infecting new groups with the linking nanotech that produced them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Razaks are a race that believes in the total subjugation of the individual to the group. Their basic ruling principle is that of a hive/one mind kind of philosophy. Within that philosophy there are specializations based on the abilities of the component member. Each Razak can function as an autonomous entity in times of emergency or if no others are nearby. This is very taxing on their emotional wellbeing and can cause suicide, catatonia, and other severe forms of mental breakdown.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Razaks believe they are the only true intelligence in the galaxy. They also believe everything existing in the galaxy is there for their exclusive use. All contacts with them will result in the Razaks destroying whatever beings they have found.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They are not stupid and will use whatever means will most likely result in the annihilation of what they have contacted. There are legends of them cooperating with other races until they could build up their resource and power bases to a point where they could successfully turn on their enemies. It required an all out effort by the rest of the races in the galaxy to push them back to their home world the last time they spread forth through the galaxy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Their ruling/controlling principle is OneMind, kind of a linking of the minds of all members of the race. It is accomplished through self-replicating nanites. Any target race can be linked in this way, however, some races do not respond well to the nanite infection and rapidly die. The ring worn by the Mind, the manifestation of OneMind, is the master controller for the nanites. It has a thought crystal like matrix for data storage, com. systems and interfaces to allow the commander to send and recieve orders and data from any linked in soldier.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During the t/z counterattack the main ring was stolen by one of the ground assault groups. They didn’t know what they had. All they knew was they had captured a high-ranking official and were trying to transport it back for questioning. During the transport, it killed itself, leaving little in the way of personal effects - a black ring, some clothes, and some other miscellaneous jewelry.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first person to touch it was compelled to take it, hide it, and finally begin wearing it as his own. On return to Zeltrop he did not reveal its existence, the rest of the crew had forgotten about it by then. There were only three who had survived the firefight in the area where the Razak had been captured. They took to hanging with each other as the evac proceeded into its final stages. If conditions had been ideal they would have been able to create a OneMind ‘cell’ on Z. as it was they perished in the gas attacks. The ring was recovered by an arcane who happened across the ruins of the village the three had been living in.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Unity</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* this section deals with the Razak Unity as it could apply to a single planet with an existing population - this would be in the early infiltrate and destroy from within phase of conquest */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Disclaimer - all information was obtained with the knowledge of the earth based Unity or through ‘mental eavesdropping’, therefore it is possible the goals and activities of the Unity may have been changed. It is also possible that the information I gathered by eavesdropping might have been altered also.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">General Unity</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Here I’m going to try and deal with the history and goals of the Unity, as well as give info I have on them and how they operate. The methods/circumstances pertaining to the gathering of this info are listed in chronological order in section 2.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This movement has existed among the various races of intelligent life forms in the universe for millennia. Where, when, how, or why they came to be is lost in history. It has overtaken and destroyed countless races since it’s beginnings. It is believed to be an offshoot of the Razak Unity and a subtle infiltration plan of theirs launched when they still were recovering from massive attritions in the days of the last galactic federation. There are no records of any race surviving long after adopting it’s philosophy - they are usually torn apart by inner conflict or defeated in an attempt to purge the universe of those not willing to be converted. This also accounts for the destruction of countless other races that refused to adopt the Unity viewpoint and were destroyed as a result.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Unity philosophy states: individuality is the downfall of intelligent beings from the grace of the creator being. All living minds were meant to join together in one glorious whole, and thus be awarded an audience with the creator being so that we might learn what it wishes us to do. Every living being with the ability to comprehend our goal must be united in this great effort or we will fail. Therefore, those who will not join us are standing in our way, and in the creator being’s way, and must die to the last of their heretic breed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">That, of course, is a condensed version of the whole, but it does present the basics. As for the obvious questions that arise on reading this, the Unity thoughtfully supplies the answers: all races, without exception, from the beginning of time, have had some concept of a supernatural being or beings who rule all, or at least have tremendous power. Each time a component of Onemind dies, its part is given to another, or it is replaced by one of the newborn. The creator being has decreed that among the gifted (intelligent) races who do not choose to join us are ignoring the creator being’s will and usurping the creator being’s gift, and it is the will of the creator being’s that they be destroyed for the good of the whole. The rise of individuality was brought about by the Opposer, the destroyer of wholeness and harmony and it is this who infests the minds of all who believe that separate can be good. In the beginning, all the minds were component cells of Onemind, but the creator being desired that we should go forth and gather information and experiences to be shared by all. This weakened Onemind and allowed the Opposer to tempt the weaker links of the chain. All things were created because the creator being was lonely in the universe - were meant to keep it company and do the creator being’s bidding. Finally the creator being has decided to give us another chance. We will be welcomed back into the creator being’s embrace if we all band together and work for it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">That is about the extent of the Unity philosophy as it was presented to me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This means that right now off shoots of the Unity are combing the universe by whatever means, looking for new races they must convert or decimate. I guess that could be one explanation for UFOs. However this is about the big picture of the Unity and not what primarily concerns us here.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The earth Unity was started by a group of ‘galactic evangelists’ who happened across this planet. I don’t believe it’s connected with our being here now. I do feel, though, that they know we’ve been here. I believe they can feel our presence, but couldn’t pick us out in a crowd. The ‘evangelists’ determined that this culture wouldn’t be able to handle a cold turkey visitation, so they began a program of indoctrination from within. It would often involve the abduction of an individual, or group of individuals, an indoctrination period, and then reintroduction of these ‘prophets’ into the mainstream world. For some reason this group has more patience than most, this program has been going on for several thousand years. This approach was taken out of curiosity and that they didn’t feel like devoting the entirety of their energies to this one system. Rather they will arrive, indoctrinate, plant, and move on to the next system in their ‘parish’ and repeat the process. There are indications that they are about ready to begin another phase though. I think it has something to do with changes in the leadership over the duration of the project. The new leaders are very likely to step up to a conversion/harvest option soon. There has been a recent implantation, probably within the last 200 years, that has helped the rapid technology increase. They seem to believe that with the higher tech comes a more easily manipulated system. Given the ways the communications nets can be used, there is validity in this theory. There is a small group of local ‘missionaries’ that are in marginal control of some of this. It is there job to create as many interlocking links as possible. The whole organization is set up in cells, very like a spy or rebellion infrastructure.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This group’s goals are infiltration and control of the world government and economic structures. Followed by a world wide religious crusade promoting Unity philosophy.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Section 2</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/*  to be constructed based on Irendi and Rani group history  */</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Section 3 - the Unity and the Rani Group</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Unity knows of the Rani Group as a multinational and they have some suspicions there is more going on than just that. They know there have been influences in the past and are a bit suspicious of the present. Nothing concrete until the shuttle missions begin, and then not until mission 12 and beyond. Their handlers aren’t due back for a while so they are attempting to deal with this situation from a purely planet based position. Their next attempts will be to begin involving world powers into the ‘hunting’ of these ‘alien invaders’. At this point they desire more to know who, what, why, the Rani Group is. If they ever find out they have the ties to the old Zeltropian system then it will become open warfare as that system has been painted as the Opposer incarnate.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Section 4 - actual history and origins</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Razak Unity started out as a loosely federated group of worlds back in the far past of the galaxy. As they expanded outward they came into contact with other civilizations. The first few were relatively peaceful and treatees were negotiated. At last, however, they came across a hostile group and war ensued. The Unity was suffering massive defeats when they contracted with the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a> to enhance their fighting forces. The <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a> created a coordinated suite of <a href="../info/razak_tech.htm">battle technologies</a> for the Razak Unity. The primary component was a nanite-like mechanism that could be implanted in the soldiers to allow for better coordination of attacks and in passing tactical information between units. Damage resistance and disease/poison immunities were added as well. The tech worked wonderfully in the war and soon the Unity had won the war. Instead of deactivating as had been expected, the nanites remained online, leaving the veterans linked. As the vets had to interact more and more with the random, scattered actions of the non-enhanced they grew more and more frustrated and bitter. When the ruling body decreed the vets relocate to an outer colony to reduce tensions, they rebelled. Within months they had destroyed or "infected" the rest of the Unity populace with the sharer tech. Thus the Razak Unity Hive Mind as it is today was born. The infection is based on to any offspring of an infected parent. The average Razak lifespan for beings from the original Unity genetic lines, has stabilized at 175 to 225 years. Old age effects are not present until the last 5 to 10 years of the total lifespan.</p>
