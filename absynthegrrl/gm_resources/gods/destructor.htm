<p class="pagecaption">Destructor</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is one of the really early gods. It split from the primal force at the dawn of the current universal age. It is the destructive force that balances the creative force.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At the start of this age it and the creator were in balance, each one understanding the importance of the other and of a balance between their effects.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As the age progressed each one sought more and more to achieve supremacy in view point. As time went along and various intelligent beings were created and evolved they would attempt to use these for proxy wars.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At last a group of younger gods fought each of these primal powers to a standstill and imprisoned them outside the flow of time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Destructor struggles to free itself and create a new group of followers. This time the goal is the destruction of the younger ones and any of their allied creatures. Then it seeks to overwhelm and destroy the Creator.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The exact whereabouts of the Elder Sign sealed gateway to the Destructor is not known.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Neither The Creator nor The Destructor realizes that the destruction of the other will doom them both and bring on the next age of the universe. If they are released from imprisonment they will immediately seek each other out and attempt to destroy the other. This will end the multiverse and trigger a new creation.</p>
