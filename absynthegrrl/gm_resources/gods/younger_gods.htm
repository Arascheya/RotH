<p class="pagecaption">The Greater Powers - the Younger Gods</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The three entities that are the Younger Gods or Greater Powers, came into being as fragments of the sentients created and destroyed by the Creator and Destructor coalesced into conciousness. They became more and more disturbed by the rampant creation and destruction, just for the sake of it and moved to stop the Elder Gods from continuing the practice. The Younger Gods combined their powers and imprisoned the Creator and the Destructor outside the flow of time. The Creator is imprisoned at the very center of <a href="../places/planescape/centrys.htm">Sphere</a>. The Destructor is imprisoned in the depths of the Null Point, the very center of Possibility's Realm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Younger Gods exist as a triad and are known by several different names based on their aspects.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stability, Order, Creation, is the face of matter, order, and form. She is known as <a href="../npcs/she.htm">She Who Must Never Be Named</a> in the city at the center of forever, Centrys, also known as City at the Center, City of Gates, and Sphere. This is the anchor point for the material forms of the multiverse. Centrys is her domain, although <a href="../npcs/she.htm">She...</a> is never directly seen by the populace of the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Choas, Possibility, Void is the face of the void, emptiness, unfulfilled potential, and formlessness. She drifts through the dark places of the universe and contemplates the raw forces of energy and entropy. She has a pocket domain, the <a href="../../common/place_images/nullpoint.jpg">Null Point</a>, that drifts on the Winds of Chaos, formed when the various dimension sets of the multi-verse colide with each other. These winds sweep through the multi-verse, causing random and rapid changes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Change, Balance, Keeper is the <a href="../npcs/irena_k.htm">Balance Keeper</a>, the one who balances between form and formlessness. This is the face that creates races, brings change to stagnant systems and order to chaotic systems. As part of her chaos she will periodically incarnate into a member of one of the sentient races and observe from within. She also uses this tactic to bring stability or chaos as required. Change is the one who has the most contact with the various Temporal forms within the multi-verse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These three are considered the Great Powers. From them all <a href="proxy.htm">others</a> are derived. In their images are the gods and goddesses of the sentient creatures created. Deep within the psyches of all sentients is a tiny kernel that came from these Powers at their creations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Greater Powers exist across all time streams. There is only one of each and they are unkillable by any normal means. There are only two ways to end them:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">1) they can meet together and unmake themselves, returning to the energy pool that is the <a href="../info/multiverse.htm">multiverse</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">2) they will end if the Creator and Destructor ever meet.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Notes</p>

<p class="regtxt5">See also <a href="../info/3sisters.htm">Three Sisters</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">The three started as omniscient, however, as Change relates to the Hut crew, "Omniscience, Omniscience means the walking of an ant is as noticeable and meaningful as the collapse of a star. While this is wonderful in some ways, it is also without a vital something. As we refined our consiciousness and became more aware, our focus narrowed. To notice a particular, non-shattering, event requires sifting through enormous amounts of sensation."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In another conversation Change admits to spawning various consciousnesses throughout the multi-verse. "The universe split into pieces and became aware, to try and understand itself. Each Temporal carries a tiny spark of Change, Stability, and Chaos."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They can change anything in the multi-verse, however, it is like poking a giant web, ripples and waves will trigger unexpected consequences in unexpected places. The greater magnitude the change, the more unexpected events. This leads them to a hands-off approach to events in the multi-verse. Stability is totally hands-off, Change will nudge, and Chaos is the most hands-on, since her aspect thrives with the randomness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">each has an item that they can use to focus their powers</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Void -<br/>
World -<br/>
Balance - a small balance with a crystal globe of Centrys in one pan and a ball of Void in the other, it will show which aspect has dominance for the area where it is held. the Great Mother uses this to determine which actions to take</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Scenario Notes: Madison</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In her last incarnation the Balance Keeper incarnated without her full set of memories. Only the Lady knows if this was intentional or not. The Lady has the keeping of the Balance Keeper's memories and consciousness. She is to return it when the Balance Keeper makes contact with her.</p>
