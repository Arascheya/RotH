<p class="pagecaption">Elaine Ariana (Rianna Scarlett) Timmenson</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rianna is one of the hottest musical performers currently going in the <a href="../info/mega_ascend.htm">Mega Corp Ascendency</a> phase of AU earth. She is a descendant of <a href="jose_collins.htm">Jose Collins</a> and <a href="dimentia.htm">Lottie Collins</a>. Rianna is a cyber-punkess playing raucous and inflammatory songs about the situation of the mega-corp dominated world. She is troubled by the hypocrisy of being a mega-star for the very system she reviles in her music.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her performance costume is elaborate enough that she can walk in many places unrecognized, until the paparazzi equivalent distribute her real-world look. Then she has to take to disguises if she wants to go out unencumbered.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rianna is a multi-media, multi-market, product, spawning anime series, games, and musical software, allowing the moving of virtual Rianna and her dance team to user created songs. Licensing is loosely controlled, enough that money pours in, not so much as to piss off the fans. There is talk of a live-action 3D vid of her in some type of action adventure product. Ariana is appalled and fascinated by how popular these cross-marketing items are.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rianna recently received a diary or journal from a long lost relative. This item contains an improbable series of observations about the 1890s, including actions of Alice Crowlen, the disappearance of Angelique Marsters, vague references to the Hut, allusions about the Wellinghams, strange creatures hidden in the ITC corporate facility, and the theory that ITC has been taken over by vampyr leadership. Rianna is fascinated and begins to research this period, trying to substantiate the diary.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* use Hatsune Miku as inspiration for how/what Rianna uses for costuming when performing. In performance her hair is bright scarlet and of improbable length - she is not a vocaloid, however, her performance image could be holographic, changling net suit, or some other high-tech "disguise" system */</p>
