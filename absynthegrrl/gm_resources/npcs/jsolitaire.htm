<p class="pagecaption">Jaime Solitaire</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime is 5'7" tall, with brown eyes, dark brown hair, three stud piercings above her right eye, and several tattoos of tribal black work. Her black work is the same as Nyisa's, but only on her right arm and shoulder and left thigh and hip. Nyis, Jamie, and Irena have the same chest work in honor of their friendship. She loved Nyisa'a work and asked if she could emulate it. She also has two studs above her belly button, three below, and a belly button piercing with ornate jewelry. She has a clit piercing, a hood piercing, and nipple piercings as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Daughter of Zerina Solitaire and a man her mother will not name. Jaime is a reader and a security genius. She can pull incredible detail from her deck of tarot cards or secure even the leakiest of corporate facilities. Her skills extend to computer networking as well as physical plants.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime worked her way through college by giving tarot readings to friends and strangers from an occult shop near campus. Her friends would not engage in any activity until they had checked it with her first. While at university she routinely ran an FRP for her friends. <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a> took her name from her favorite non-player character in Jaime's game.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime harbors a serious resentment against her absent father, although her mother has tried to defuse it whenever she noticed. Her mother feels no animosity and realizes that the relationship would have been worse had he stayed. This has lessened in recent years as she has used her skills to read for herself more. The readings she has seen show hints that life would have been worse had "dad" stayed around.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime became employed by Rani Corp. early in its growth. <a href="vashi_r.htm">Vashi</a> was a friend of hers in college. When <a href="vashi_r.htm">Vashi</a> was in need of a security expert she poached Jaime from her current employer. Over the years their friendship has strengthened. Jaime has no fear of taking <a href="vashi_r.htm">Vashi</a> to task when she is out of line about security or other issues. <a href="vashi_r.htm">Vashi</a> has come to rely on Jaime's tarot readings as a part of her business model planning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once she was allowed into the inner secrets of the Rani Corp operation and goals, Jaime began to notice how similar their background resembled the gaming world she had created. Over time <a href="vashi_r.htm">Vashi</a> and she came up with the idea of the MMORG as a recruiting tool. She contacted <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a>'s company and provided funding under the conditions that <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a> and <a href="sophia_n.htm">Sophia</a> were to be the lead design and development team and that she had complete creative control. The company would then recieve complete funding for the game project from Rani Corp.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime has shown no sign of suffering from the problems of love as her mother did. She has taken lovers and retains her gift. In her case, taking lovers has made the gift stronger. She has consistently used her abilities to the benefit of <a href="../info/rani.htm">Rani Corp</a>. This includes seeing the trend toward war between the Meriksas and the Ruskala, allowing <a href="../info/rani.htm">Rani Corp</a> to take steps for safety. She talked more with her mother as she grew up, her theory is it isn't sex that reduces the gift, but a transfer of power to a girl child during pregnancy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime grew up in the rougher parts of a large city. Her neighnorhood was abandoned buildings and run down apartments. There were lots of street kids and homeless. She and her mom got by reasonably well because of the crime boss her mom worked for. After the boss was taken down, her mom had to work harder to keep up. She was friends with <a href="s_draybin.htm">Sarah Draybin</a>, a semi-street kid in the hood. They were close and <a href="s_draybin.htm">Sarah</a> sort of lived with them after her mother was killed in a tenants rights dispute.</p>
