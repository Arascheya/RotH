<p class="pagecaption">Shareya (Shar)</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Current Version</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shar comes from an area of islands and pirates. Her family was killed early in her life and she has been living with her mother's mother, in a shack, in the deep swamps of a larger island. Her grandmother is a priestess of the <a href="ishra.htm">spider goddess</a> and a seer. Shar has learned the herbal arts from grandmother, but is not a seer or priestess.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shar would have remained with her grandmother and followed her path if she hadn't been enthralled by the pirate <a href="ghunayya.htm">Nayya</a>. <a href="ghunayya.htm">Nayya</a> came to the swamps seeking healing after a horrific battle for her freedom. Grandmother revealed they would become the fiercest pirates of the seas and travel beyond the edge of the world into new waters. This ends up being the seas near the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She started <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_bbb.htm">Blood Bath and Beyond</a> as a joke, and because she wanted some quick cash. When she found out it was a catchy name and became a favorite, she franchised out the name to various other merchants for a percentage of their take, and right of first refusal on any majik items or weapons traded or purchased.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Original Version</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shareya arrived with <a href="shardra.htm">Shardra</a> when she fled the forces on Arduin attempting to kill her. She is one of <a href="shardra.htm">Shardra</a>'s oldest friends. She started <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_bbb.htm">Blood Bath and Beyond</a> as a joke, and because she wanted some quick cash. When she found out it was a catchy name and became a favorite, she franchised out the name to various other merchants for a percentage of their take, and right of first refusal on any majik items or weapons traded or purchased.</p>
