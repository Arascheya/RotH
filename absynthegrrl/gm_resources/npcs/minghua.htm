<p class="pagecaption">Minghua "Ming" Kwan</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Minghua is five foot seven, with grey-white hair, and deep brown eyes. Her hair was dark brown until she hit puberty, then it turned the grey-white it is now. Her voice is low, a bit gravely, rough and her speech is a bit hesitant, as if talking is not her first form of communication. Her voice was damaged when a violent client attempted to stragle her when she was eighteen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ming is wary of strangers, especially men. She warms up quickly to people who show her kindness. She tends to trust women more easily than men. She does not want children and is not interested in serious relationships, at least not currently.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ming lived with her parents in a tiny, single room space, in the Gyoshu Section of the <a href="../info/forevercity.htm">Forever City</a>. Her father was a technician and her mother cooked at a small eatery two floors down in their section. Both her parents died in an epidemic that swept the poorer sections of the Forever City when she was fourteen. To keep the tiny room, she turned to prostitution. The single room apartment had a window into the nearby corridor that Ming would use to display herself to attract clients. She didn't mind it, somewhat enjoying the sex without commitment, and sometimes working with another neighbor, <a href="file:///z:/shapes/daiyu.htm">Daiyu Kikucha</a>, when a client would want two women. Ming and Daiyu have a mix of repeat clients and walk-bys. Daiyu is more closed down than Ming. They are friends, but not very close. Daiyu lives in a single room similar to Ming's.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Ming was eighteen, a violent client attempted to strangle her. It wasn't caused by anything she could think of. Later, she figured out it was how he got off. One of her neighbors, <a href="file:///z:/shapes/ruomei.jpg">Ruomei Tazhyn</a>, saved her by killing her assailant. She learned that no one cared because he had no political standing in the section.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ruomei and Michelle Han nursed her back to health. Michelle and her father run an apothecary shop next to Ming's room. They live in an apartment in the next level down, reached by a stair from the shop. Michelle and her father grow herbs on the roof of their section and fungus in the deep parts of the section.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ruomei lives in a slightly larger apartment next to Ming's. Ruomei is an e-tech and has been teaching Ming. Ruomei works in the sub-levels, on the trains that bring in the food and the subways that move people between the larger regions of the city. Ruomei also does e-tech things for the people in her sector. Ming stays with Ruomei when the low grade PTSD hits and she is too nervous to stay in her own place. A stray cat, Chianghou, adopted Ming and Ruomei shortly after Ming was attacked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ruomei leaves to go adventuring when Ming tuens twenty. Ruomei gives Ming the access codes to her aprartment and leaves Chianghou with her. Ming takes up the e-tech trade in a small way, scavanging broken items, attempting to fix them, then selling the working ones to others in the section. Ruomei also taught Ming basic self defense and how to use knives.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Taylin Orzarz and his family are another set of neighbors. Taylin is half-blind and runs a bake shop out of the front of his rooms. The bakery is in a center section, and the family lives in the far back. It is a large family, with everyone helping with the bakery. The older children sleep in the shop after it closes for the night. The younger ones live in the back with Taylin and his wife.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ming is a <a href="../pharmacom/organics/jossyth.htm">jossyth</a> user. She started after she was attacked. Ming has not become fully addicted. She knows she has to use it sparingly to keep sharp for her e-tech work.</p>
