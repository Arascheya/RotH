<p class="pagecaption">Eleza Ekretherion</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Eliza is a fighter. High spirited and brash she will claw her way through anything in her way. She comes from a dieing world where a Death City Recovery Team was sent.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Born on a world in conflict she was part of a last stand battle. During the final moments she was stunned by a blow from an opposition trouper. <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> found her under some rubble. When she awoke she first tried to gut <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> in her disorientation. Then she thought <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> was the goddess when she looked up. At last <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> convinced her she was only another person.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Eliza is a <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_shadow.htm">Shadow Walker</a> as well. Eleza is restlessness and angry and is even more obvious than it is in <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a>. Through her <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> begins to see what <a href="merris.htm">Merris</a> was talking about.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For personality think a cross between Faith and Eliza.</p>
