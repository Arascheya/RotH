<p class="pagecaption">Merp - previous player character</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A veteran of the Hell Gate Wars</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merp will be 50 years old give or take.  He will have kept up on some of his weapon skills (he trains some of the local youths to suppliment his moneys), he will tell stories now and then at the bar, but only those that a bard has already sung at the Inn or well known ones from the area.  He will give sound advise if asked for it, and sometimes he will volunteer some.  Anyone watching him closely will notice that he watches everyone in the Inn, especially strangers.  Occasionally his eyes look dark and troubled or possibly sad and wishful.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He is soft spoken and his voice has a cultured sound not often found in small fishing villages.  He is willing to bank roll adventurers down on their luck, and since he has been paid back more times than not he has the reputation of being a good judge of character.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merp is always willing to talk with adventurers just in from the field.  Unless a roll of INT*2 or less is rolled the adventurers will not notice that they have been pumped for information.  If they do notice that he has been asking a lot of questions he will just pass it off as "its been an unusually dull week here at the Inn".</p>
<p class="regtxt5">His surface back ground story is that he used to be an actor in the capitol city, and that he had to leave town fast due to loving unwisely.  "Make sure the Lady does not have a husband or is betrothed.  Also make sure she is not of the royal family."  If anyone catches him out on this one he will pass himself off as being the scapegoat for the losing side of a power play by some minor nobles.  Both stories have years worth of work in them so are very hard to break up, and Merp will never mention names or places (Note "in the capitol city" he does not mention which country.)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merp will also have reasonably accuate maps of the area and will only mention their exsistance after knowing the person for a long time or after a person has proven him/herself.</p>
