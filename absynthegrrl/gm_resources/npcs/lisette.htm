<p class="pagecaption">Lisette (Lis)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lisette appears hard and cold from a distance, but is warm, friendly, and accessible once you get to know her. She is fiercely loyal to her friends and a deadly enemy. Her cold side allows her to be an excellent Thieves Guild leader and her warmth makes her popular as a tavern keeper. Members of the guild often hold legitimate positions in the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern of Dark Delights</a>, however, not every employee is a Thieves Guild member. Those in the know have recognition signs for getting word to the guild when needed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lisette arrived with <a href="ghunayya.htm">Nayya</a> when she fled the forces of the East Oceanic Trading Company attempting to kill her. She is one of <a href="ghunayya.htm">Nayya</a>'s oldest friends. She has become the head of the Thieves Guild in Jakara, the capital city of the Lotus Empire.She is also the owner and manager of the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern of Dark Delights</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="ghunayya.htm">Nayya</a> and <a href="shareya.htm">Shareya</a> rescued Lisette soon after they formed their alliance. The core decision group has remained <a href="ghunayya.htm">Nayya</a>, <a href="shareya.htm">Shareya</a>, and Liksette ever since.</p>
