<p class="sectioncaption">Common Knowledge/Legend</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Oriana Web is the white-haired offspring of a street trollop and an elven adventurer/warrior. Oriana's father did not know about her until l5 years after her birth and he never saw her before his death. When he did learn about her, he entrusted a large amount of money to a friend and asked him to find the girl. Very shortly thereafter Oriana's father was lost during an adventure.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The friend, Phineas Web, a pleasant-looking if bookish sort of fellow, traveled to the City to find Oriana. What he found was a 17 year old street slut. He immediately set about using her father's money to train and educate the girl. During the three years of working with her, Phineas started an insurance company, and used Oriana as an example of what could happen to then-children if they died. The company became outstandingly successful, and Oriana quickly became a shining example of the result of Phineas' services.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Phineas, fell in love with Oriana. They married and he spent the last Five years of his life in absolute bliss. His unexpected death at the hands of person or persons unknown, shattered Oriana. The culprit was never caught, but most people ascribed the murder to old grudges and the rumor about a cult seeking retribution for Phineas' participation in the sacking of a temple.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Since her husband's death, Oriana has continued the insurance business and carried it to even higher profits than Phineas realized. She hosts two charity balls each year, and often attends parties given by the "right" people. She has even, in a couple of special cases, paid off on insurance claims even though the policies had lapsed (In both cases the families were destitute).</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Truth</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oriana may have been uneducated when Phineas found her, but she was not stupid. She spotted him as a mark from the go, and gladly used all he taught her without abandoning her connections with the darker side of the City. She relished her access to the City's upper crust. She enjoyed the money Phineas's insurance company provided her. She even liked Phineas, sort of.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Phineas' death and Oriana's skill with a dagger are not directly linked, but his blood is on her hands. She saw a great potential for expanding the insurance business to cover far more than just adventurers, but she also knew Phineas would object to diluting their resources by expanding. Oriana began to spread the story about a cult - a true tale Phineas had shared with her because it included much brave action by her father - then hired the assassin to kill Phineas. She killed the assassin and is the only person to know the truth behind Phineas' demise.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oriana met Keir Collis at a party and their involvement grew from there. Oriana, because of her ties with the underworld, has suspicions about the passing of Collis' other lovers. She has taken a number of precautions against Collis deciding to kill her, and she has informed him of roughly half of them.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Scenario Suggestions</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario 1: Ghosts in Walls.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The cult in Phineas' story does exist, and wants revenge for the desecration of their temple. The cultists, seeing Oriana and her success as entirely due to Phineas, decide she must die to fulfill their mission of revenge. Oriana, through underworld contacts, learns of the plot against her and hires the party to protect her from these assassins (This will make fora great "haunted mansion" type adventure where the assassins have gotten into the Web mansion and the characters have to find them before the assassins can carry out their mission of death.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario 2: Return of the Avenger.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oriana's father is not dead. He comes back and learns of his daughter's double life. Unbeknownst to her, he had written Phineas Web and both men agreed to keep his survival a secret to surprise Oriana. Later, as Phineas got the feeling Oriana might be plotting against him, Phineas sent a letter to a tavern both men had used as a message drop. Oriana's father got the letter and has reason to suspect his daughter murdered his friend. Apparently, the friendship between himself an Phineas involved some powerful oaths and he is honor-bound to avenge his oath-brother's death. He hires the characters, as people who know the area, to investigate Phineas Web's death.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario 3: He's Much Nicer When He's Dead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oriana decides it is time to marry again and she sets her sights on a minor noble as her next husband. Of course, Keir Collis is a bit of a complication as far as her plan is concerned. She hires or seduces the characters into killing him. She tells him he is bothering her, and she drops hints about his plot to buy insurance for his ships, then reporting them sunk to ruin her business. She could even point the characters in the direction of some of Keir's dead lovers and create a scandal that blows the roof off part of the City!</p>
