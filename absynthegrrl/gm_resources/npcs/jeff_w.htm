<p class="regtxt5">Jeff - womanizer, somewhat chauvinistic, interested in <a href="irendi_w.htm">Irendi</a>, especially after she starts to dress better, did not try to displace <a href="alan_b.htm">Alan</a> for her because <a href="alan_b.htm">Alan</a> had better contacts in upper management, has everyone in his division watched - security/espionage concerns, takes it a little too far - farther with females, not so much mysogenistic as he feels he's god's gift to women, homophobic, especially about lesbians because he cannot understand why a woman would prefer another woman over him, does not believe women can perform as well as men on the job, emotional, health issues, pregnancy, etc.</p>
