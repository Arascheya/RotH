<p class="pagecaption">N'Ashta</p>
<p class="regtxt5">N'Ashta is the engineering assistant on the <a href="../items/antigone.htm">Antigoni</a>. She is very capable with the Tech aspects of things, but very weak in the Magic side. She worships the ground the twins walk on because of their incredible skills.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">N'Ashta was abused by her parents and the Temple once they discovered she was a lesbian. The Temple tried to cure her at the request of her parents. This was done using psychological and physical torments, intended to reveal the wrongness of her beliefs. N'Ashta hates the Temple and has disavowed her parents. She never wears revealing clothes because they would show the scars from the tortures used by the Temple.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is spiritual, in her own way. She believes the life forms of Hexiaz are connected in a web of thought and energy that creates a 'god' that lives in the clouds. She is happiest when the ship is out in the clouds, away from the chaos and noise of the Hexiazi.</p>
