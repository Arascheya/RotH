<p class="pagecaption">Lynn - Llewellyn Tigrero</p>
<p class="regtxt5">hyperdrive, tech,  and computers - embedded control/HD control and operating programs</p>
<p class="regtxt5">wants - to see new places and work on hyperdrives, be left alone by pompous know-it-all pricks</p>
<p class="regtxt5">motivators - wants to be HD engineer on a starship, angry at system that has denied her this</p>
<p class="regtxt5">planets: what the hell is this? No environment controls, vermin, etc.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Personality tags:  remains in engineering or cabin most of the time, acrophobic, reserved</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ship Position: Engineer, much to the relief of <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> and <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Personality: quiet, polite except when someone tries to tell her how to maintain engine or starship systems.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Details:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">martial artist</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lyn grew up on space stations and starships, she has no real experience dealing with the wildness of surface conditions. She is almost the opposite of <a href="krystal.htm">Krys</a> in this way. She helps pull <a href="krystal.htm">Krys</a> through learning to survive in the empire, <a href="krystal.htm">Krys</a> pulls her through surviving on Zeltrop - she has no familiarity with the mix of organisms running riot on most planets, she has a very hard time dealing with this, and with having to thrash her way through all the plant and other life when they land on Zeltrop, insects in particular make her crazy</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She fixes hyperdrives more by a pattern kind of thing than by the normal methods. She got through school but it was very difficult, especially in the later classes. She could see the patterns of the hyperdrive energies in her mind, but the math that represented those patterns was very difficult until she was able to write a computer program to translate the formulas into patterns. Once she could do that then she could start to integrate between the two ways of seeing. In this regard she is like <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> and magic.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She tried to enlist in SpaceFleet, but her instructors branded her as unorthodox and difficult. She then applied to one of several of the large transport companies and actually had a job with one of them until she blew up at the captain when he tried to tell her how to do her job. He left her on Tenris and she worked there for a brief time until she hired on with a smaller operator. That lasted a couple of months until she was again unable to contain her ire and was let go on Bastyl’s Outpost. She managed to wrest a job at a really rundown repair facility there, mostly cause the old guy who ran it desperately needed help and she’d put up with his tantrums. He in turn was able to tolerate hers. They scraped a poor living until she repaired a drive problem that had plagued a small operator through several other facilities. He told his friends and work picked up after that. She has taken over once the old guy retired a few months before <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> and <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> arrive needing help.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She ended up on the fringe worlds because there was less hassle from the small ship owners when it came to certificates and paper validations of her skills. She was able to demonstrate a very high ability and her reputation grew by word of mouth until she was one of the more sought after engineers. Unfortunately her reputation for having no respect for command structures followed her also - so while everyone sought her out for repair no one would hire her as a crew member. <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> and <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> come across her on Bastyl’s Outpost, working out of a run down hanger facility near the port. She is now the owner and sole operator of Martinez Ship Services, which she inherited from Alonzo Martinez when he died.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lynn tends to hang out at the <a href="../places/farstarbar.htm">Far Star Bar</a> on station when she's not actively working. She is friends with the entire crew at the bar.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">she was born and lived much of her childhood on Terestene 5, one of the seven L-Point mining stations and habitats of the gas giant Terestene. These were holdings of <a href="../info/develstar.htm">DevelStar Resource Development Group</a>. Her father, mother and brother were all employed as mining crew.</p>
