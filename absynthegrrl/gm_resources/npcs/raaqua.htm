<p class="pagecaption">Raaqua - previous player character</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Raaqua comes from the region near the Isle of Experiment. She was a player character in the Dhar Ankes/Oriz scenario and one of the first iterations of the Hut. She was from a group of Shape Shifters - of the were-tiger clans.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* the following is some rough data on what was going on in this scenario/campaign package */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Raaqua is a baboon style character from traditional RuneQuest for this scenario. If he is needed he can be transformed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* transport to Hut - Minstrell of the Dawn was major clue holder at this point - the players enjoyed Gordon Lightfoot, so the song list was heavily his - plus there was a sharing of earth souls and Zelp souls in this campaign */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Raaqua-</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You awaken in a room with walls, floor, and ceiling made of a silver metal with a lime green tinge to them. The room is lit with bright white light from square panels in the ceiling.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You feel as though someone has placed your head in a vise and squeezed, but the feeling is not physical, more like you have had too many things happening all at once and your mind has shut down and is now just beginning to wake up again. You have vague recollections about incredible sights of pasts, futures, and alternate "nows". None of the images are clear enough to actually remember.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">About twenty feet away from you you see a male human with curly light brown hair, going slightly grey, a close trimmed beard and he is wearing close fitting leggings/breeches of a blue colored coarse fabric and a woolen shirt with a checked pattern of bright colors. On the floor next to him is a strange wooden device, with strings, similar to a lute but with a different body shape.</p>
