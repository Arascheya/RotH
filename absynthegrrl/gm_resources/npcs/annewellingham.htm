<p class="pagecaption">Anne Isabella Wellingham</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Anne Isabella Noel King was born in 1837 to Ada Lovelace and William King (Lord Lovelace). She was her mother's daughter, constantly picking her mother's brain about mathematics and Babbage Engine programming. Like the chief engineer she would like to take technology to the next level. She keeps the dream of the Difference Engine alive and remains in contact with Babbage after her mother's death. She persuades <a href="lordwillem.htm">Willen</a> to look into creating a working one. Once it tests out she and Henry Babage immediately set to work on an Analytic engine. For more information on the technology itself see <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/contents.html">Analytic Engine</a> on the fourmilab site.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She is older than <a href="lordwillem.htm">Lord Wellingham</a> by three years. They are very much in love. One of the things she finds most attractive about him is his ability to see her as a person rather than just a woman. This is one of her lessons to <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy</a> and her friend <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a>, demand the respect due all people, particularly in potential mates.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She has always encouraged <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy</a> to excel in the sciences, paying for tutors and additional resources when the local schools wouldn't accept that girls could learn those things. <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a> was another beneficiary of this attitude. As the daughter of the Wagon Lit comptroller and a friend of <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy</a> she also recieved a good education.</p>
