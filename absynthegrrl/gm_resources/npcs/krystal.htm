<p class="regtxt5">Details:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Krystal is the daughter of <a href="margla.htm">Margla</a> and ?. She was born in the hut and almost immediately placed in the desert in the place of a dead child in a family group killed by a sandstorm. She was found by owner of a brothel and was to be trained as one of the girls. She rescued the owner from an angry arcane shortly after arrival and was adopted as her daughter. When the time came for her training she was given a choice of what she desired to do. She went through the training and took to thieving on side. This she kept quiet about when she found out her step mom didn't approve of thieves.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">By the time she was 16 she was an accomplished thief and had become lovers with Annalise, another companion of the house. She recovered a bit of blackmail material from a noble who had been controlling the house. The noble retaliated by killing Annalise. Krystal had her resurrected and agreed to pay tithe for her. She supported tithe by stealing. Not long afterward Krystal killed the noble. The madam got her a position with <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> so she could get out of town before more trouble occurred.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> had her trained as a thief and assassin, she did well in the training but tended to avoid actual assassination assignments. She moved quickly up his organization until she became the head of the thieves. He trusted her as much as he trusted his lover, until he went nuts over <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a>’s interference.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Krystal was assigned to an adventuring party headed to the fabled Gardens of Lazaar. The party managed through very good fortune to look at parts of the <a href="../cobra_inx.htm">Cobra Book</a>, including the part detailing <a href="../places/karanal/karanaldata.htm">Karanal</a> and the super computer system there. She kept this out of her report.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her next assignment was as part of a rescue mission to earth. They were to rescue some people <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> had tricked into trying a flawed gate controller. While on mission she was injured by rifle fire and left by <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> for dead. She was rescued by <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> and <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> abandoned her on Earth a Seer told him she had seen the <a href="../cobra_inx.htm">Cobra Book</a> and data about an extremely powerful Ancient artifact, the <a href="../places/karanal/karanaldata.htm">Karanal</a> super computer. Now he wants her so he can get that information from her. He plans to extract it in any way necessary.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* this is the older or gaming version  replace this with the new version as soon as it is written*/</p>
<p class="regtxt5">she returned with them, then they had another hyperdrive fault, this one induced by some of the crew, and ended up on Z during gaming time again, <a href="lynn.htm">Llewellyn Spencer</a>, <a href="will.htm">William Jean-Luc Hazelwood</a>, and her were the only survivors, she would like to return to the galactic empire time period, mostly to remain away from <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a>'s organization, they need dilithium control crystals for the starship to re-launch it, it is hidden in the mountains, she is masquerading as a deaf mute on the <a href="riverwind.htm">River Wind</a> while searching that area for crystals, they need three more to repair the ship, she will take opportunities to slip off the <a href="riverwind.htm">River Wind</a> and scout</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* end of older/gaming version */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* new/Valen version */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">she was rescued by <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> and <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> and returned to their time. Her injuries were a bullet crease to the head, which dropped her, and a bullet near her knee. Later another hyperdrive fault returned them to Z. they ran a river ship, the <a href="riverwind.htm">River Wind</a>, while looking for supplies to repair the starship. <a href="margla.htm">Margla</a> drew <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a>, <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> and her into the <a href="../../hut_valen/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a> to free herself and bound them as the Second Triad in place of herself, <a href="she.htm">She Who Must Never Be Named</a>, and the <a href="../monsters/demons/consumer.htm">Consumer Demon</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">she is the most balanced of them all - exhibiting more of a zen acceptance of life, the universe, and everything. She is a capable warrior and an ardent lover. She is balanced enough in herself to give and receive love without a lot of the hangups and suspicions of those around her. during the time on <a href="ghostwind.htm">Ghost Wind</a> and later on the <a href="riverwind.htm">River Wind</a> she, <a href="lynn.htm">Lynn</a>, and <a href="will.htm">Will</a> become lovers.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">she has seen a lot and is sometimes made tired from it. She watched <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> go nuts, she saw Henry struggle with the wealth and power of his impromptu organization, she was transported to various strange places, including the high tech world of the Imperium.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She is also one of <a href="margla.htm">Margla</a>'s daughters.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">somewhere in her travels she will get <a href="../char_type_info/facedancers.htm">face-dancer</a> training - also need to rename this for copyright issues</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Bad to Worse</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was there when it went from bad to crazy. Aztol had been building secret alliances for years without informing any of us what he was doing. It didn't matter that I was his spymaster, or head of covert operations, as Irena would call it. His chief of troops, his head of technology, and myself were kept completely in the dark until his demonic allies delivered a bound container to our base.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We had been steeped in techno magic, but most of us still didn't understand it. Aztol had the container moved closer to a mass of tubes and hooked several up to the container. After twisting small wheels and waiting, he said, "Time to decant the prize." He motioned his house troops forward, then stepped to the front of the box. Several large hasps were released and the front swung open. Hanging by steel chains was Ishra, Queen of Spiders. She was half way between spider form and human form, appearing the same as many of her statues.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aztol motioned a team forward. They unhooked the chains from the container and dragged the form to a circle and clipped the chains to heavy tie points around the edge of the circle. Aztol stepped forward and rammed a large syringe into the still form and shoved the plunger down. Ishra's form shifted and shivered, fading and solidifying into a fully dark elf form. The team released her chains, dragged her through a door into a room crammed full of techno magic. There was barely enough room for the two chairs surrounded by racks of strange equipment. I had seen this room before, as head of covert ops. The equipment was a brain scan device, a devce which allowed the operator to reach into a mind and pull out its secrets, or stuff new ones in. Two of the team lifted Ishra and set her in the left chair, attaching heavy straps to her once she was settled. A dish, filled with clear crystals with swirling purple fog, was lowered over her head.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aztol motioned the team out of the room and turned to the machinery. I started to leave with them but he called for me to remain. He flipped switches and turned knobs on a large console until he was satisfied, then picked up another syringe. He emptied this one into the still form and stepped back. Slowly the red irised eyes opened and she surveyed her surroundings. "So glad you could join us, my dear," Aztol said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Release me," Ishra hissed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You wish to leave so soon? I'm hurt," Aztol replied. "I fear you may not do that. You see, you have things I need and you will give them to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In your twisted dreams, human!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have you attached to a very special device. With it I can make you think and believe whatever I wish. For example, summon one of your little recorder spiders, the ones you create for the bitch known as the keeper." He tapped a few switches and Ishra's face went from a defiant glare to a slack jawed stillness. Moments later a small spider appeared in her hand. "See? Thank you, my dear. Once you have settled in, I will have other things you will do for me. I look forward to a long and prosperous alliance." He was laughing as he walked away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He turned back and looked at me. "Oh, Krystal, will you see that she is fed? And make sure the door remains locked at all times. We wouldn't want her to be disturbed." I stared at Ishra long after Aztol had gone. I wouldn't have believed a techno device would work on a goddess. The nervousness I always felt stepped up to dread as the possibilities sank in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not happy with your master's activities, young one?" Ishra asked softly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did they capture you? I wouldn't have thought it possible."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She smiled without humor, "Betrayal, the usual situation in the Abyss. What turned the tables was the number of other demon lords willing to cooperate long enough to do this. Do you knw how your master managed such a thing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I may be the head of covert ops, the spymaster, but he rarely tells me everything I need to know."</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Describing Bad</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* mention her growing up in the most famous house of pleasure in the Lotus Empire and what her adoptive mom taught her about the politics of power - add to this Aztol's strategy of crashing about, ignoring the dynamics he could use to reduce his exposure - also mention, when he was weak and small, he was a better player, but started losing it as he became a force in his own right - now he walks in and starts killing without any real attempt to recruit or use local assets and intelligence */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need to figure out how long after Aztol grabs Ishra that Krys is left outside the pyramids - shouldn't be too much longer, since he is in the depths of madness when he grabs Ishra */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was a foundling, taken in by Ghanimah, the mistress of the highest ranking house of pleasure in the Lotus Empire. Ghani had no daughters and raised me as her own. She taught me the politics of power and many other lessons on how to survive in groups of people.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aztol started out poor and weak. He played the games of power well until he began to gather power. As his power grew, his disdain for everyone else grew with it. By the time he was a force to be reckoned with, he would march into a situation and start killing off those that opposed him. He always incurred costs far greater than if he'd taken time to study the local powers and play them against each other.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the early days, my position of spy master was valuable to him. He would consult with me before any campaign. As his disdain grew, his reliance on good intelligence and careful plotting was left behind. At the tme of the capture of Ishra, I was little more than a prop, a person to be displayed to others, but largely ignored on real matters.</p>
