<p class="pagecaption">Cassilda (Muggles - the little servant demon) - bound High Priestess of Meera</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Betrayed and imprisoned by <a href="thehand.htm">The Hand</a> early in his rise to power. She is the last of the Meera priesthood and the last to hold the knowledge of the spells of the cult. She was imprisoned in a blue glass bottle and left buried under Haven. To anyone finding the bottle she appears as a lesser demon capable of performing simple commands. Should any give her drink, food, and let her sleep with them she will revert back to her original form. Sleeping with Muggles does not require sex, just holding and cuddling. Once in this form she desires to find the holy relics of Meera and work to re-establish the cult. She has <a href="../char_type_info/facedancers.htm">Face Dancer</a> capabilities once she is freed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* this is what she will tell her benefactor at her release - modify as appropriate for the current scenario - she is originally a Haven NPC so beware of copyright */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I had seen a crippled youth walking along the road and befriended him.  He said he had just ventured forth into the world but had not yet selected a cult. I told him about mine and he agreed to come with me to hear more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He stayed and began to learn. A day came when I was given a pendant to signify my approach to Rune status.  Later on this day I was instructed to bring the boy to the priesthood for acceptance.  When he came into their chambers he said some evil sounding phrase and a chariot pulled by demons appeared.  He cut down the other Rune Priests and Lords with fire and spells then turned to me and said, "No my girl you have served my desires so I shall not cut you down with the rest, but neither can I allow you to go free.  You shall be imprisoned until a specific set of circumstances are met.  The only clues you may give are, 'Master give Muggles a drink, master feed Muggles, master sleep with Muggles.'  Yes, my dear you shall be as a lowly little demon, ha ha ha!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Thus I was until you found and released me.  What he has done with my pendant I do not know but I must find it.  Contained within it are some of the Rune Spells my cult knows.</p>
