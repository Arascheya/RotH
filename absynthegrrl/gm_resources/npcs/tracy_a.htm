<p class="regtxt5">computers and such - pendant - need to figure out what the pendant does</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Traci - manager of something bogus and unimportant at General Defense, given minimal support and resources because she turned down <a href="jeff_w.htm">Jeff</a>'s advances, comes across as a ditz at first, but underneath is a fair amount of intelligence, she is very good with computer systems, she helps <a href="irendi_w.htm">Irendi</a> crack her way into the Gen. Def. systems after Irendi is fired and helps her remove some of her designs, also helps <a href="irendi_w.htm">Irendi</a> track down the real spy in the firm roller blades are her favorite form of non motorized transport.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She programs as art - viewing programs as woven patterns/designs rather than logical steps/blocks. She has a very hard time explaining what she is doing when she’s writing code, this was the second reason she was moved out of programming assignments at General Defense. Has several tattoos, all very artistic and done as single pieces.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Traci has pendant that was given to her by her mother’s mother in Algeria when they were visiting her after her grandfather’s death. Traci was six at the time and the youngest of  3. None of the others were interested at all in being there or in listening to grandmother’s stories of life as a nomad. Traci would sit for hours and listen spellbound as the woman described her childhood and youth. Once when she was showing Traci some of her jewelry Traci looked at a 7 pointed star pendant and said, "Grandma, that’s my necklace."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her grandmother replied, "Of course it is dear, I was keeping it safe for you. May it bring you good fortune."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After that the bond between them became even deeper, lasting until her grandmother’s death 12 years later.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">grandmother was from area around Zerhamra near the grand erg occidental and the oued saoura</p>
