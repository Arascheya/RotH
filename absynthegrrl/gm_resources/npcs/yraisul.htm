<p class="pagecaption">Yasmine Raisul</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The picture was taken on her 18th birthday at the Yamasa Walhedra Archology, Seattle</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was born in Tangier Morrocco and was moved to Chiba City when her mother was recruited by Yamasa Walhedra. Yasmine was ten at the time. Her uncle moved to London when she moved to Chiba City.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They were relocated to the Special Projects Arcology when Yasmine was seventeen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yasmine is multi-lingual from these various moves, speaking fluent Arabic, Tarifit (a Berber dialect), Japanese, and English.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yasmine finds archology life to be boring and common place. She has begun slipping out and hanging at the Coffee Messiah and her uncle's restaurant next to it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">older info - from Jeff's game</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is a Tech-Wizard in her early to mid thirties. She has been around and while she may not be as up to date in raw knowledge as the newer/younger ones she makes up for it in hard earned wisdom. She is second on Snow's team and the one whom Snow would vote most likely to survive if she were to walk away from the corp.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was born in Casablanca Morrocco and was moved to Chiba when her mother was relocated by Ronin DigiTronics to work on one of their genetic research projects.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hangs out at the Coffee Messiah, an old style coffee house desperately hanging on to a dieing clientelle. It’s kitchy religious icons are faded now and the current owner makes only half hearted attempts to keep the chippers and other riff-raff out, but there are a couple of data ports and once you are known as a regular you are relatively safe hanging there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Next door is the Morocco Moon, a higher class Middle Eastern style restaurant run by her uncle. She maintains his staff and business databases in exchange for free meals in the kitchen. He has connections into? (local middle eastern power block of some sort - certainly not as powerful as the main players, more of a protection/assistance network for Moroccans living in the Metroplex)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She lives in the arcology near Snow's quarters and they have formed a friendship that extends beyond working on the same project.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yasmine is a fan of <a href="rianna.htm">Rianna Scarlett</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Icon: middle eastern dancer with veils. Veils spin off and become parts of attack/defense programming.</p>
