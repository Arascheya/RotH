<p class="pagecaption">Teresa</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Possible character - she is quiet, shy, and etherial. She is on an abandoned rail line waiting for a Death City train in the snow. She is a tragic sort of character in her home world and comes to Death City in the usual death as transition way.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Teresa becomes one of the drivers for Kali's team.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The <a href="the_author.htm">"Mystery Woman"</a> will talk to her once in a while. Eventually they end up hanging out together and Teresa takes up residence in another section of her warehouse. Teresa is the only one to ever get the woman's story.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Teresa was found by Kali beside the tracks at the request of Dispatch. She had frozen to death after running from home dressed in thin white shift. She fled to avoid her brother's advances. She is an incest survivor, except for being dead.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Current alternate - she was killed after being used by her brother and his friends. She had been suffering sexual assault from her brother for several years prior to this event.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Teresa is only slightly more talkative than the <a href="the_author.htm">Mystery Woman</a>. She and the Mystery Woman become friends over time. Eventually Teresa moves into another section of her warehouse. They talk to each other quite a bit through instant messaging. As they get to know each other better they can be found in the Mystery Woman's section sitting next to each other and IMing over their network.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Have Do You Believe in Angels by The Last Dancer come on when they are headed away from the pick up point. This could trigger some discussion of Teresa's past.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Pickup Scene</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali slowed Leopardess as she rounded the bend. There, to the right of the tracks, a white shape lay face down in the dead leaves and grass. Leafless trees kept silent vigil. Except for the sprawled shapelessness of the body the girl might have just been sleeping.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali eased the train to a stop and climbed down to the rail bed. Crumbling ballast and rotting sleepers revealed the desolation of this piece of track. A chill wind just stirred the dead grass. Carefully she approached the body and gently rolled it over.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sightless grey eyes stared up at the sky. "Oh gods!" Kali hissed at the gaping slash across the girl's throat. Breathing in gasps she tried to slow her wildly beating heart.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A strange shudder passed through the body as a faint white mist oozed from the open eyes. Slowly it swirled and clotted together until a shadow-rendering of the dead girl formed. With a soundless cry she threw herself at Kali. At first she was just a cold breath on Kali's skin. Gradually she solidified, her form pushing Kali's arms until she held a slowly warming form.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali held her close and stared into the distance, knowing the hideous death wounds would show in vivid contrast for a few minutes more. They wouldn't fade until the essence transfer was completed. When the girl started to shudder and cry silently Kali murmured reassurances until the worst of the shakes stopped. "I can take you away from here. Is that what you would want?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hold me, please just hold me. So cold." Kali kept her close and started to ease them away from the body. "Hands tearing at me. Pain, oh the pain, burning. First one, then another, and another, until I went numb. Why did they do that? Why!?" Her hands beat weakly against Kali's sides. "The knife was a relief," she added in an empty voice.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I have you. They can't hurt you any more." Kali murmured reassurances to the shivering girl.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't understand..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I have you. You will be safe where we are going."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* finds the grotto with the mystery woman - a small, hot pool fed by a bubbling jet that waterfalls into a cooler pool below. it is on the train line to the Repository and hidden in a small mountain valley near the tracks. could have a siding nearby for stopping orthat could be added later - determine if this is a lush pool or in a very dry and severe area - either works, think New Mexico or thick forest */</p>
