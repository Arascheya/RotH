<p class="regtxt5">Owner of a meat pie shop on Fleet St. Local vampires use her to dispose of annoying corpses left over after a night of frivolity. <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> has used her services from time to time to get rid of some street pest or the other. In return, she has used her resources to remove the left-over bits to reduce the displeasing odor of the dead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The meat pies are a taste sensation and favored by many in the nearby shops and businesses. Many will make the trip from other parts of London for a fresh one.</p>
