<p class="pagecaption">Sharyl - Stormy</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Personality: kindly, grandmotherly over hull metal core. She does not suffer fools lightly. She is also known as Stormy because of the short temper she had when she was younger.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sharyl is the logical one in the pair that is her and <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a>. She is the one to point out flaws or unexpected outcomes in <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a>'s schemes. <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> balances out Sharyl's tendency to get stuck in the details and lost in the logic. They work in a non-adversarial relationship, each complimenting the other.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Abilities: use all arcane spells, head of planet wide training system, in on all tests with <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> and <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ideas: life with gypsies, life at tavern, life as arcane trainee, and mistress of school</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Notes:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sharyl now runs the <a href="../places/val_exp/misk_u.htm">Arcane school</a> in the <a href="../places/val_exp/val_exp_inx.htm">Valley of Experiment</a>. She tends to hang out at the <a href="../places/val_exp/failed_mage.htm">Failed Mage Tavern</a> where she tends bar. She is also the owner and manager of the facility. She will still be seen periodically at Stormy’s however <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> has mostly taken over that facility now. She tends to get bored with the bureaucracy of the School and retreats to running the bar at the <a href="../places/val_exp/failed_mage.htm">Failed Mage</a> whenever she can get away.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She and <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> have become lovers over the last years as <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> has become more withdrawn. She has responded to her incredible life-span with optimism and a sense of curiosity, similar to <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a>. This has been what has kept her from falling into the isolation and slow despair that is eating at <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> is their child.</p>
