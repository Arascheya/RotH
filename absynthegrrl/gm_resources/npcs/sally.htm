<p class="regtxt5">I have the idea that <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> (or her team) found her during an extraction, and brought her back.  Her "talent" is something which they all need, as (though Sally doesn't know this herself yet) she can "see" and identify approaching demons, even if they're not yet in the physical plane.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She'd been very badly mis-used by her previous masters however, hence the fear of even thinking about what she can actually do.  "Just another little lost one!", as I suspect someone will end up saying.</p>
