<p class="regtxt5">Uru Live KI: 01750901</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Younger, baby, sister of <a href="uru_irena.htm">Irena</a>. She works as an erotic dancer and goes to school during the day. she is studying sociology</p>
<p class="regtxt5">During the time <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a> and <a href="uru_irena.htm">Irena</a> are investigating <a href="sophia_n.htm">Sophia's</a> disappearance, she is in Hawaii with her room mate and partner, <a href="uru_tyana.htm">Tyana</a>, dancing in Hilo. She could be contacted and given access to the phantom house if it is desired to use it. Would need to figure out why it was there, who owned it originally, and why they would open it up to Katya.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Katya might have the van from <a href="../../common/story_images/vandwg.jpg">vandwg</a> and use it in her travels as an exotic dancer. Her partner, <a href="uru_tyana.htm">Tyana</a>, tries to get booked into the same places so they can work and stay together.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Early in the Irena tales she and <a href="uru_tyana.htm">Tyana</a> go to Hawaii to work at the Harem Club, part of Maharaja Resorts, one of the subsidiaries of Rani Corp. Maharaja Resorts cater to the insanely rich and beyond. They  don't really advertise, relying more on reputation and word of mouth. Lailani Kalapa is the proprietress of the Queen's Court, the Hawaiian Maharaja Resort. It is located on the Big Island, where the <a href="http://www.waterfall.net/index.html">Inn at Kulaniapia</a> is located. The resort is large having twenty rooms that can be rented that are family safe and twenty that are part of the Harem Club complex. The two areas are separated in such a way that it would be very hard for a regular guest to end up in the club. Both sections have a series of natural appearing pools, a restaurant, bar/lounge, spa, gym, and business areas. Because Maharaja Resorts are backed by Rani Corp, they can take a very hard line stance on abuse of the staff. Katya observed a very wealthy and powerful person being escorted out after he inappropriately touched several of the dancers while in the pool area. Prostitution is not expected or encouraged, however, if the girls want to engage, they will be scrupulously protected from clients and law enforcement. Katya and <a href="uru_tyana.htm">Tyana</a> are offered a 6 month contract. At the end, they will be offered permanent employment within the Harem Clubs network. There are many Harem Clubs, in many countries world-wide. Contracts can be written for either remaining at a specific club or rotating through other locations at the desire of the employee.</p>
