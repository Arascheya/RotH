<p class="pagecaption">Massias - Colonel of the Deathfeathers</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lives in the Valley of Experiment.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Physical Description:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Hunan female,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Ht. 5'8", Wt. 119#, Age. 25</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Fighting Prowess: Excellent with a self-bow. Good with dagger.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Magic Ability: none</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Common Knowledge/Legend</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Massias' rise to the rank of Colonel was nothing short of meteoric. Her long black hair and blue eyes, as well as attractive face and lithe body, spawned the cruel rumor she rose so quickly because of liasions with superior officers. There are also rumors of sexual favors being given to the men under her command, but neither set of rumors has any validity. She was allowed into the Deathfeathers - theCity's elite Archer company - because she won a City-wide archly contest. Prior to her entry, the Deathfeathers had been exclusively male. The contest did not prohibit women from entering, though most did not try because the prize was a slot in the Deathfeathers. Their insignia is a pair of crossed arrows with broadhead points that look like death's-heads. All Deathfeather arrows are stamped with a skull face on the razor -sharp head.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was awarded a command when a small band of Deathfeathers were ambushed and their Lieutenant was slain instantly. She snapped orders at her comrades and prevented them from Fighting independently, as the cocky archers are sometimes wont to do. Through her leadership the ambush was destroyed. Soon after that she led half the Deathfeathers on an expedition to destroy the renegades who staged the ambush. They were slain without a single Deathfeather casualty. She was decorated as a result of that action and made a Colonel and acting commander of the Deathfeathers First Company.</p>

<p class="sectiocaption">The Truth</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Massias, raised in the countryside, grew up with a bow in her hands. Her superior eyesight has enabled her to hit targets others can barely see. As the eldest daughter of a large family, her command skills came from organizing a legion of siblings for anything - chores, hunts or harvest time. She left the family farm to her siblings and traveled to the City to escape the increasingly bold attempts of local men to win her hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In many ways she is sad with her career. The Deathfeathers, being under her command, cannot be her friends. Yet the rumors about her promiscuity and, alternately, her icy heart (a rumor started by rejected suitors among the nobility) have isolated her from much of the rest of the society. Massias would like a man who was willing to accept her and her abilities without the "Once we're married you won't have to do this anymore" attitude that seems to come with most adult males.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She does not like soldiers or adventurers as suitors, and currently has fallen for Augustine, the bard. His avoidance of her advances has confused her.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Scenario Suggestions</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario 1: The Telltale Shafts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Allegations arise that the death of the Lieutenant that gave Massias the chance for command was not due to the ambush. A noble, who's son is a member of the Deathfeathers and was in line for promotion, produces a hunter as a witness that Massias shot the Lieutenant as part of a prearranged plot, then organized the attack against her group. She was supposed to betray the Deathfeathers, but instead she double-crossed the assassins and had them slain. Massias hires the adventurers to venture out and recover the Lieutenant's body from where the Deathfeathers buried it. The arrows that slew the Lieutenant will still be in the body, and they will prove she did not kill him (The arrows remain in a fallen Deathfeather so the spirit will know it is dead and so it will know, from the arrows, who to haunt).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Complications:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">1) the noble and his sniveling son attempt to stop the adventurers.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">2) the Lieutenant was buried in a private family crypt in a particularly old cemetery - one reputed to house unquiet spirits and ghouls. A further complication would be to have his body be gone!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario 2: She's the Boss!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The adventurers are hired on as scouts and shock troops for the Deathfeathers. Their current campaign requires fighting to get a bit closer than the archers are used to and, given their recent experience with ambushes, they relish the support. Having Colonel Massias, a woman, lead the expedition may irritate some male players, but if that's not enough, having her order the adventurers into obviously dangerous situations, should heat things up. The friction could make for some interesting character play especially if, when joining the characters on a scouting patrol. Colonel Massias and the characters are cut off from the main body of Deathfeathers and have to slip back through enemy lines to reach their compatriots.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario 3: Winner Takes None.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Idaya Trueshaft (see True-shaft's Bowery in CBI) and Massias are both talked into an archery contest in the City. Idaya had not entered the contest Massias won because she did not want a spot in the Deathfeathers. Now a great many people have money riding on the contest and the local gamblers want to fix the match (violence implied here). Idaya and Massias both hire members of the party to guard the other, each confident she can protect herself. If the characters are from different groups within the same campaign - groups that know each other only by reputation - any battle or meetings between them will be interesting and an excellent forum for character play. Complications: Danny O'Grunnion and the unpleasant elf, "Sheets" Eddrad (leaders of the Big Fish Gang from CB3) are secretly betting on opposite sides of the contest.</p>
