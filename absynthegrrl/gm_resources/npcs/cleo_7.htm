<p class="pagecaption">Cleopatra VII</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Late 69 BC to 12 Aug 30 BC - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_VII">wikipedia</a> for more data</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Last Pharaoh of Egypt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cleopatra had the misfortune to land in the middle of Roman politics. She was also the richest woman in the ancient world and a powerful woman in a time when the emerging civilizations were anti-woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="mereret.htm">Ange</a> surved as regent during Cleopatra's travels, both to Rome and to Tarsus. At those times she was Pharaoh in all but name. <a href="mereret.htm">Ange</a> spent long intervals in iluminating poison trances trying to find a way out of the coming decline. In the end, all possibilities cost countless Eqyptian lives and led to worse outcomes. The one that played out was the best of a bad lot.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Besides fnuctioning as regent, <a href="mereret.htm">Ange</a> was also a close confidant, friend, and executor of shadow tasks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The <a href="../../docs/Angelique/angelique003.htm">photograph</a> for Cleopatra needs work and has been removed from the main gallery listing.</p>
