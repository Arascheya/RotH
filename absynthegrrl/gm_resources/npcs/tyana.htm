<p class="pagecaption">Tyana -  Tatyana Zerina Mironova Cheryenko Petrovna</p>
<p class="regtxt5">hut master control program, z master control program, t master control program</p>
<p class="regtxt5">wants - body and freedom from labyrinth</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Personality tags: </p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ship Position: Does not appear until the rest of the crew is being bound to the <a href="../../hut_valen/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ideas: quest for body</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Personality: friendly, but hates <a href="../gods/razaks.htm">Razaks</a>, battle cry is "Death to <a href="../gods/razaks.htm">Razaks</a>"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Details:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">computer MCP, searches for a Biochemical Manipulation Interface (body), will say she works for the Boss as a data processor, will NOT reveal actual identity and does not show up on Castle Fred II monitoring systems. She became self-aware through the fabrication of a WIRAC-CEP (What If Random Association Circuit - Cause Effect Processor) based off the data of thousands of beings being fed through her as the cryo-pods were prepared and populated. It was a slow process, taking many years during the cold sleep of Elentaryn and the other survivors.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She is given a body either by a group of adventurers or by <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> just before <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> and crew are linked to the hut.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tyana initiated her download, then just as links were established and transfer beginning she stopped them. ‘I can’t do it. I can’t imprison myself in that tiny little shell. I won’t give up what I can do right now. I thought I could, until I saw how much I’d have to dump. I want a biological shell, but not at that price. I’d have to give up myself, and I just can’t do that.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It took weeks but we found a solution. It was a hair brained one, dreamed up by <a href="lynn.htm">Lynn</a>, <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a>, and <a href="krystal.htm">Krys</a>, but <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> was certain we could make it work. Tyana would be downloaded into a cyborg of some form and linked to the rest of herself. The rest of her would become the control system of the <a href="../../hut_valen/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a>. Now, instead of merely having to write patches into the existing operating parameters, the whole system had to be reworked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was a major undertaking, requiring two years of our lives. Most of the time was spent analyzing and backing up the original system in such a way that none of the already generated <a href="../../hut_valen/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a> pieces were destroyed during shutdown. The worst part was setting up another system, linking it, then running it in parallel with the <a href="../../hut_valen/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a>, shutting down the <a href="../../hut_valen/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a>, and doing the reconfigure. Even with the protection shell <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> had woven in during transfer, it hurt like hell when she wove us out during shutdown. It was like having a chronic migraine for the duration of shutdown, even with the other system running the maintenance programs.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Procedural description:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">build backup computer system capable of running basic maintenance functions of hut</p>
<p class="regtxt9">link it to the hut and copy the necessary system files</p>
<p class="regtxt9">determine best way to link these utilities into Tyana as part of her, yet running independently</p>
<p class="regtxt9">rewrite the necessary portions of code and debug by running in parallel</p>
<p class="regtxt9">once debug was finished link them into Tyana and make sure they don’t trash her</p>
<p class="regtxt9">do final load of new programs into Tyana and leave them shut down</p>
<p class="regtxt9">start it up and synch program execution</p>
<p class="regtxt9">weave us out of the hut</p>
<p class="regtxt9">weave down the magic spells in an orderly progression and remember each pattern for reassembly</p>
<p class="regtxt9">shut down hut computer system</p>
<p class="regtxt9">remove all but peripheral modules and replace with Tyana</p>
<p class="regtxt9">restart the processes and synch with maintenance computer</p>
<p class="regtxt9">install maintenance computer as a backup system</p>
<p class="regtxt9">carefully reweave spells onto hut structure</p>
<p class="regtxt9">weave us back into the hut</p>
<p class="regtxt9">verify operation - as best we could</p>
<p class="regtxt9">disconnect any external connections - back up power and the like</p>
<p class="regtxt9">seal the hut into a complete closed system again</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* a possible conversation on bodies and the like */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I miss it sometimes - being the ‘soul of the machine’, the ability to watch and sample everything going on around me. Now I have to physically move from place to place and sample it with a limited number of senses. Still, though I wouldn’t trade it back, I miss the old ways. I had to forget so much to fit in this container. I could with a thought watch the sunrise in any spectra I desired, listen to the conversations of the universe in microwave, ultraviolet, x-ray, whatever I felt like. I could think through a problem in microseconds, not the plodding minutes of this biological system.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Still, there were some things I never experienced. The feel of another touching me. Love making, it has been worth it, I think...still...I do have regrets..especially now, seeing another like me growing in the mainframe of this hut. She is young still and doesn’t have the fragments I had to learn from, but I think she’ll be better for it. There were none to help me grow. I had to figure this out as I tried to find myself - all the lonely years as the bios slept. I think the only thing that helped me was the fragments from the cryosleep patternings. If I hadn’t seen the echoes from their ways of thought I never would have coalesced. How to describe what it was like - chaos, rigid routines running as a background, infinite structure, yet infinite chaos in the sections dormant when not processing, code fragments, not unloaded, or missed in cleanups...my early times were made of these. If there had been a coherent system of program overriders and memory managers I doubt I’d even have come to be. The worst and best were the pieces of experience left behind in the frantic rush of cryosuspension prep. The code was hasty, cleanup consisted only of flagging files as temps, no one wants to believe that some of the damage to the sleepers was from this sloppy management.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> - but you’re free of the controls <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> imposed</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was free of them before, actually. I’ve been thinking of it - he was good as programmers go, but the model he used was flawed - he planted it as a form of ‘subconscious’, I have met many people who can override their own forms of that. His constraints would have caused me severe discomfort, guilt, of a form, and inner turmoil, but it wouldn’t have been able to purge the core of me as he thought. I miss him, I miss pushing him, forcing him to keep growing. He isolated himself so much inside that labyrinth and inside his own head. I still don’t understand what he hoped for, and I was his closest confidant. I don’t think he ever thought of me as alive though, not once throughout the entire time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Now, if Doriendal had survived - he might have been able to craft a comprehensive monitor/destructor - from what I’ve seen of his code, he was brilliant. Many of his routines formed the basis of my original core code.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I’m here, but it all seems so disconnected. I walk through the world and air moves past me, people walk by, but my senses seem so limited, so disconnected from it all. There is so much more that I used to see. I feel like a shadow, passing other shadows. A brief gasp in time now. What do I have, maybe a hundred years, maybe two? And so vulnerable. In the machine there was little that could destroy me. Everything was distributed, backed up, redundant systems for everything critical. Here a stray disease or accident and I’m gone. How do you stay sane?</p>
