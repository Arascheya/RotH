<p class="regtxt5">The Minister of Highways is occasionally seen galloping into Haven from either the Horse Gate in the South Corridor, or the Caravan Gate in the North; he and his band are charged with the suppression of banditry   along   the   Long   Road and   the routine maintenance of the roadway. Boldan Hansumrogge (#203) is    an   exceptionally   strong, well   built, and good-looking centaur, with green eyes and long blond hair which whips in the wind when he runs. He has developed a fondness for a half elven girl  (who happens to reciprocate his feelings), and will normally be found at her home in the Glens- when not out of the city on anti-highwaymen forays (most of Haven is wondering' about this relationship). He leads a band of mixed two-and four-legged fighters (two-legs frequently riding four-legs), who have   developed   a   reputation for ruthless efficiency in the extermination of bandits and other undesirables who attempt to prey on the Long Road's traffic.</p>
