<p class="pagecaption">Dan Fredricks</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan has known <a href="lara_march.htm">Lara</a> since first grade, although Lara started out as Lenny. They were best friends until Lara's change and now are friends and lovers. Some suspect they were lovers before the changes, but they were very discrete if so. Dan is very bi, so the rumors are likely true. <a href="shae_anders.htm">Shae</a> entered the mix during junior high, becoming the third of the trio.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan has an older sister, Sarah, and a younger sister, Rachel.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan's parents are rich. They really like the other two as well and repeatedly offered to pay for Lara's changes. They immediately took her in when her parents tossed her out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan's younger sister, Rachel, made some comment to Dan and Lenny when they were in second grade about "weiner glasses" for male anatomy - this brought Lenny's issues to his mind and they festered there until she could take action in high school.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Dan was starting high school his branch of the family inherited the <a href="../places/fredricks_mansion.htm">Fredricks Mansion</a>, located off Monroe St., near the Fredricks Park. The eccentric uncle who lived there did not take care of the place. Dan's family had to occupy the lands to validate the inheritance. They sold their house in Lara's hood and moved into a less run down out-building for validation. Now they are working to renovate the main house.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The out-building where they live is a converted carraige house. It links to the escape tunnel through a steep set of stairs under the stairs up to the living quarters. The carraige house is small, so the family is cramped until they get a section of the main house rebuilt. Dan and Lara move into the main house first, Dan's parents like the simplicity of the smaller space, while Dan and Lara like the old and almost haunted vibe of the main house.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara and Dan are avid gamers and are following the Realms of the Hut development almost as closely as <a href="talia_a.htm">Talia</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* use Arnold Vosloo for appearance */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* live in out-building on property of mansion in photo - mansion is family home that had been owned by an eccentric uncle, now willed to Dan's parents. It was not cared for, so they are having to fix it up, which is why they are living where they are */</p>
