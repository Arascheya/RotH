<p class="pagecaption">Seraphina Kodetova - Sarah Magdalena Arnstein</p>

<p class="regtxt5">See Her Story for more details</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sera was born in Gibbstown, Lofrida, the winter home of the circus. Her family weren't circus people, although Sera desperately wished they were. Her mom hated the carnival life and ran from it when she met and married Daniel Arnstien. This formed a large gulf between her and the rest of her family. She did not stop Sera from hanging out with her grand aunt, Petra Kodetova, because it provided easy child care while she was working two jobs to keep them fed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her mother, Anna, converted to Yawachismwhen she married Daniel, who was a firm believer. Sarah observed the faith while in it, but it never took. She could see the beauty in the traditions, but the core beliefs seemed kind of silly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sarah started going by Seraphina when she started school in Savnaugh. She wanted to carve out a nitch for herself that wasn't centered around the Yawach tradition and culture that formed her upbringing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sera started hanging out with her grand aunt, Petra Kodetova, as soon as she could walk to her house, which was a few houses down from where she lived. Petra used to read tarot for a large carnival and continued to read for the local population after she retired. After Sera becomes her closest friend and confidant, she finds out Petra worked in a burlesque troup, run by her mother, Anezka Kodetova. She is <a href="uru_irena.htm">Irena</a>'s cousin through her grandmother. Partial family tree is in <a href="uru_irena.htm">Irena</a>'s page.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petra was a fake, using the usual methods to direct the mark and make it look like a reading. Sera, on the other hand, is the real deal. She has access to the Core of Being and enough prescience to give acurate readings instead of the mark led fuzzy readings. Petra prefers readings using a crystal ball, since the mark cannot question her reading of something like cards. Sera is equally at home with either system. She finds a crystal ball is better for Core of Being access since she can just stare at the ball. She prefers a round, gothic themed deck of her own design for card readings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sera will become prescient when she steps through a gate for the first time. It will hit her hard, causing disorientation and overlapping information, leaving her completely disconnected from reality as the many possibilities crash over her. She can focus and determine the highest probabilities, but it leaves her weak and unfocused after the fact.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Her Story</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I loved my mom, I just couldn't be like her. She was the daughter of circus and carnival folk, but she ran from it as soon as she could. All she ever wanted was to be normal. She married Daniel Arnstien and settled in to life as a wife and later, a stay at home mom. My earliest memories are of her being extremely happy, until dad was killed by a drunk driver one night. Then she had to go back into the work force and try to make enough to support us.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We lived a few houses down from my great-aunt Petra, a fortune teller, who had retired from the carnival circuit. I stayed with Petra most days when my mom was at work. She told me magical stories of her life and fed my hunger for things that weren't what my mom craved. She also showed me her tricks for reading fortunes. It was all about reading the reactions of the mark, then pushing in the directions they hinted at, while pretending to stare into the crystal ball on the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petra first let me try with a friend of hers when I was eight years old. I sat at the table, unfocused and stared into the ball. Images immediately formed in my head about her friend. I zeroed in on her main trouble of the day and walked her through several possibilities, all without giving a single thought to the tricks. Her friend paid double and walked out smiling. Petra looked shaken and a bit scared when she looked up. "How did you do that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Know exactly what she wanted? You didn't ask any of the questions I gave you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I remember looking at her, completely puzzled, and replying, "I could see her thoughts and where they were focused."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What am I concerned about right now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I unfocused, without even glancing at the ball, and said, "You wonder what I will think of you, now that I know you are a fake." I ran to her, climbed into her lap, and wrapped my arms around her neck. "I love you. You help people. And you gave me something awesome!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't tell your mom, ok? She wouldn't be happy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know. Mom wants me to be just like her, even though I can't. I can pretend ok though. Can you show me the cards?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't need them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, but they're so pretty."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petra used the traditional Wyder and Wrathie deck, made popular by books and movies. Once I understood the symbology, I drew my own deck. It was crude, since my eight year old art skills were poor, but it led to improvements every year.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Those were happy days, lasting from when I could first toddle to Petra's place until I predicted her death when I was ten. It was cancer, fast, virulent, and caused by asbestos she had come in contact with thirty years before. I was devastated and inconsolable. That's when my mom moved us to Savnaugh.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mom had formed a relationship with a wealthy man there. I'm not sure how it happened, but I hadn't been paying much attention. The move was a blessing and a curse. I was the new kid in school and it sucked. I also found Madam Iyasha's Grove, a vudahn and reading shop run out of a very old home off one of the crumbling squares of the city. Madam Iyasha fed my thirst for knowledge and she shamelessly promoted my skills as a psychic. She banked half my income in a fund to be released to me when I turned eighteen, and it turned out to be far more than I would have imagined.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had wanted to hate my mom's new interest, but he was amazing to her and good to me. Neither of them understood why I couldn't be a normal little girl, but they managed to love me anyway. They were married, in a regular church, shortly after we moved.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As I said, school sucked, until I reached high school and met Marta. Marta was as much an outcast as I was. She had moved to Savnaugh not long after me, but had been in Cothloc schools until high school. Her father, well step-father, loved her fiercely. Her mother was a raging bitch, convinced her daughter was bound for hell since she didn't suck down the Cothloc view. I had seen Marta around school our first year, but didn't really meet her until she came into Madam Iyasha's. She found it to be the same refuge I had. Asha, Madam Iyasha, took her under her wing as well. Marta devoured everything she could on vudahn. Her skills with it were similar to mine with reading. Marta bloomed in the dark recesses of the shop and soon she was the reference for even the most seasoned practitioners that came in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta and I also became each other's first lovers. I was bi, but she was strictly woman oriented. We lasted until she graduated from high school and her mom started in on her to get married and make babies. She was slowly decaying from the pressure and the constant arranged meetings with boys. She kept sane by diving into local theatre, then she got a scholarship to Davisson four years later. Her step-dad was extremely proud and fought her mom to let her go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I never could figure out how her mom could hold on to her. Marta was one of the strongest women I knew, although, she didn't seem to realize it. Vudahn seemed to be her passion, but she let it slide once she took up with the theatre people. I was proud and sad when she left for Davisson.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Original Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Opt 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sarah started going by Seraphina when she hit puberty. She wanted to carve out a nitch for herself that wasn't centered around the Yawach tradition and culture that formed her upbringing. Sera's birth father left when she was three and her mom raised her as a single parent, until she died of cancer when Sera was twelve. Her Uncle Arthur and Aunt Elizabeta Klipstien took her in after her mother died and moved her to Yew Nork. They love her and have guided her without trying to control her. As a result she loves them deeply and is happy helping them run the <a href="../places/artie_deli.htm">Artie'sDeli</a> in the Underland region of Brushwick.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sera loves Yew Nork, the art, the theatre, and the mixing of so many cultures.</p>
