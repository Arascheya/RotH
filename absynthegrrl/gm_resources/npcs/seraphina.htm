<p class="pagecaption">Seraphina Kodetova - Sarah Magdalena Arnstein</p>

<p class="regtxt5">See Her Story for more details</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sera was born in Gibbstown, Lofrida, the winter home of the circus. Her family weren't circus people, although Sera desperately wished they were. Her mom hated the carnival life and ran from it when she met and married Daniel Arnstien. This formed a large gulf between her and the rest of her family. She did not stop Sera from hanging out with her grand aunt, Petra Kodetova, because it provided easy child care while she was working two jobs to keep them fed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her mother, Anna, converted to Yawachism when she married Daniel, who was a firm believer. Sarah observed the faith while in it, but it never took. She could see the beauty in the traditions, but the core beliefs seemed kind of silly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sarah started going by Seraphina when she started school in Savnaugh. She wanted to carve out a nitch for herself that wasn't centered around the Yawach tradition and culture that formed her upbringing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sera started hanging out with her grand aunt, Petra Kodetova, as soon as she could walk to her house, which was a few houses down from where she lived. Petra used to read tarot for a large carnival and continued to read for the local population after she retired. After Sera becomes her closest friend and confidant, she finds out Petra worked in a burlesque troup, run by her mother, Anezka Kodetova. She is <a href="uru_irena.htm">Irena</a>'s cousin through her grandmother. Partial family tree is in <a href="uru_irena.htm">Irena</a>'s page.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petra was a fake, using the usual methods to direct the mark and make it look like a reading. Sera, on the other hand, is the real deal. She has access to the Core of Being and enough prescience to give acurate readings instead of the mark led fuzzy readings. Petra prefers readings using a crystal ball, since the mark cannot question her reading of something like cards. Sera is equally at home with either system. She finds a crystal ball is better for Core of Being access since she can just stare at the ball. She prefers a round, gothic themed deck of her own design for card readings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sera will become prescient when she steps through a gate for the first time. It will hit her hard, causing disorientation and overlapping information, leaving her completely disconnected from reality as the many possibilities crash over her. She can focus and determine the highest probabilities, but it leaves her weak and unfocused after the fact.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Opt 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sarah started going by Seraphina when she hit puberty. She wanted to carve out a nitch for herself that wasn't centered around the Yawach tradition and culture that formed her upbringing. Sera's birth father left when she was three and her mom raised her as a single parent, until she died of cancer when Sera was twelve. Her Uncle Arthur and Aunt Elizabeta Klipstien took her in after her mother died and moved her to Yew Nork. They love her and have guided her without trying to control her. As a result she loves them deeply and is happy helping them run the <a href="../places/artie_deli.htm">Artie'sDeli</a> in the Underland region of Brushwick.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sera loves Yew Nork, the art, the theatre, and the mixing of so many cultures.</p>
