<p class="pagecaption">Sarah "Seraphina" Magdalena Klipstien</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sarah started going by Seraphina when she hit puberty. She wanted to carve out a nitch for herself that wasn't centered around the Yawach tradition and culture that formed her upbringing. Sera's birth father left when she was three and her mom raised her as a single parent, until she died of cancer when Sera was twelve. Her Uncle Arthur and Aunt Elizabeta Klipstien took her in after her mother died. They love her and have guided her without trying to control her.As a result she loves them deeply and is happy helping them run the <a href="../places/artie_deli.htm">Artie'sDeli</a> in the Underland region of Brushwick.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stepping through the Gate to <a href="">Sphere</a> altered her, giving her a disorienting sense of prescience. She can see all possible futures, overlaid on one another, in a dizzying array of conflicting images. This is an unbidden "talent" and often leaves her huddled in a corner somewhere, shaking and either vomitting or drooling. She can shut it off with an amulet from the Asylum, but it is an all or nothing effect.</p>
