<p class="regtxt5">Image is Kaltereth before <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a>, when she was still eating and taking reasonable care of herself. After <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> she is emaciated, shrunken, and bent. She looks 10 times older than she actually is until after her escape. Then she begins to return to her previous health.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Newer Version</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaltereth was born in the Sultanate of Kharatoum. She was the daughter of one of the Sultan's favored caliphs and began her majikal studies as soon as she was able. She was one of <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a>'s students and exhibited great promise. She studied at the School of Magic on Trilbarash, at the Great Well of Worlds, until <a href="nyigroth.htm">Nyigroth</a> attacked and destroyed it. She wanted to expand on <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a>'s research into majik and nodes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aztol kidnapped her shortly after the destruction of Kharatoum through a series of ruses, used to convince her he had knowledge she needed about <a href="../gates_inx.htm">Gates</a>. She had retreated to her tower at the Lone Mountain, which had been a gift from <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a> shortly before the great battle. Before her departure, something made her scatter the key to her tower across the lands, splitting it into several pieces as it dispersed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She remained a captive of <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> for a great long time, bouncing through time as his pet arcane. She was convinced she would die in captivity until she met <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a>. <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> convinced her she could escape even as she was helping <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> to destroy her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After she helped <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> escape she was fitted with a <a href="../monsters/demons/rider.htm">Rider Demon</a>. It kept her docile but reduced her usefulness and also reduced his watchfulness. She finally managed to escape from the Spider Ship a year later. However the process caused her to land, badly burned, in the Crowded Sea. She was rescued by a trade ship and taken to Machine Ruins. Because of the time and space traveling capabilities of the Spider Ship, she landed in the Lotus Empire sixteen hundred years later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After her arrival, she had two daughters, with two separate adventurers as fathers. One, Barake Milzithin, went on to become the Commander of the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a> armies. The other served as a unit leader in the army.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The trauma of her injuries and the residual majik from blinding the <a href="../monsters/demons/rider.htm">Rider Demon</a> allowed her to enter into a simple life as a peasant wise-woman ever since. She drinks at the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern of Dark Delights</a>, where she can be found in one of the back alcoves. She keeps her rider in check by drinking a fair amount and never exerting her mental skills. She remains in a distracted state, brought about by almost constant imbibing of <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_drinks.htm#8legs">Eight Legs Liqueur</a> which will stupify a <a href="../monsters/demons/rider.htm">Rider Demon</a> slightly faster than knocking the drinker into a coma.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is currently extremely old and living in <a href="../places/lotus_empire/machine.htm">Machine Ruins</a> and is often found in the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern of Dark Delights</a>. Shortly before the arrival of the players, <a href="kayara.htm">Yara</a> will have visited her and reminded her of the chest hidden in the caves and workings surrounding the <a href="../gates_inx.htm">Gate</a> outside <a href="../places/lotus_empire/machine.htm">Machine Ruins</a>. <a href="shareya.htm">Shareya</a> will remember seeing <a href="kayara.htm">Yara</a> talking with her if asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a brief time her studies were interrupted by the Hell Gate Wars. Once she was able to resume her studies she expanded on <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a>’s theories by proving a hierarchy of nodes. Simple nodes were the most common. These linked to somewhat more powerful nodes and so on, up to the major nodes. Majik can be performed anywhere but at nodes the effects are greater and easier to achieve. The more powerful the node, the easier majik could be performed there and the more powerful its effects were. During her researches she worked her way up the chain of nodes to a major one. There she realized one of her greatest dreams when she discovered <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a>’s <a href="../info/k_tower.htm">tower</a> on the Lone Mountain. He was so close to discovering the theories she finished at the time of his battle with Nyigroth. Shortly before her disappearance she discovered her node was one of the super nodes <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a> had proposed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Captured by <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> 26 years pre-current time. <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> became aware of her researches into gates and nodes and wanted to use her research. At first she assisted him willingly for the information he could provide in return. Only as time went on did she begin to see the madness at his heart. By then he had her on residual poison and used this to coerce her continued compliance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She remained a grudging partner until he forced her assistance in working over <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a>. She helped <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> escape to Vilyanu then attempted to escape herself. <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> captured her and fitted her with a spider keeper, a Rider, a technology <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> gained when he captured and brain scanned Ishra.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Rider kept her docile but reduced her usefulness and also reduced his watchfulness. She finally managed to escape from the Spider Ship a year later. However the process caused her to land, badly burned, in the surf off the coast of <a href="../places/free_islands.htm">Far Reach</a>. The trauma of her injuries and the residual majik from blinding the Rider allowed her to enter into a simple life on <a href="../places/free_islands.htm">Far Reach</a>. This lasted many years until she began to tutor local youth in majik. Now the Rider stirs along with her memories.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Crazy Serena has been her persona since landing at <a href="../places/free_islands.htm">Far Reach</a>. She helps the locals with simple potions, small healings, and plant lore. In recent times she has become the mid-wife when the old one passed on. At first she amused local children with simple tricks and cantrips, until Verkal began to pressure her to teach him. At first she refused, something in her subconscious remembering the Rider. He finally won her over though after proving himself adept at the simple stuff and harassing her relentlessly to always learn more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As her memory returns the Rider stirs, beginning once more to awaken and remember its task. For several months now she has been experiencing nightmares from her past and a growing feeling of dread about her future. </p>

<p class="regtxt5">In her possessions she managed to keep hold of the key to her tower. All during her time with <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> she had feared his taking it from her and his discovery of <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a>’s secrets. His desire for revenge blinded him allowing her to retain the key. With his revenge underway and his anger at her for escaping she no longer has that protection.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"> At the time of her capture she teleported the key to her tower to her sister. This is the key that has found its way down to Alyssa through her mother.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tell players:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is so much I should tell you but I haven't any time. He’s coming. The Rider is awakening and he knows where I am. You must not be here when he arrives.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">*hands the key to Verkal*</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Take this, I have no use for it anymore.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Beware the violet eyed one, the Perverter of Spiders, the Revenge Seeker. He is evil and insane. Were it not for a drive for revenge he would have already sought the students of <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a> for their knowledge. He seeks what I sought, knowledge of the majik nodes and of dimensional majiks. He has an artifact, but he doesn't understand it fully yet. Be thankful for that.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">*memories of nightmares blossom into Verkal’s head - Hunter, choose 2 of your more intense ones from the last game*</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="raisilian.htm">Raisilian</a> and <a href="kalyana.htm">Kalyana</a> were students of <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a>. Each working from their own theories, they sought to expand his knowledge. <a href="kalyana.htm">Kalyana</a> disappeared about the same time as <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a>, but <a href="raisilian.htm">Raisilian</a> did not. I found a scroll talking of his place. It is there on the side table. No, do not open it where I can see - the Rider has not yet seen it. It is your only hope of escape, all the places around here it has seen through my eyes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is a third, one who should have been known as Dimension Mistress instead of <a href="margla.htm">Fleshfeaster</a>. The legends say she has accomplished that which no other has, the melding of Ancient Magic and Arcane Majik. I sought her also but always I was one step behind. He seeks her most of all, yet she would likely kill him where he stood. She who is known as <a href="margla.htm">Margla the Fleshfeaster</a>. There is no more time. You must go now.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">*she pulls up a small vial*</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With this I will buy you time. It won't be much, but it might be enough...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">*drinks and goes into convulsions*</p>
<p class="regtxt5">GO!!!</p>
