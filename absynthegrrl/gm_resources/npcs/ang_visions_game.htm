<p class="pagecaption">Angelique Visions - Game</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Young watcher on a stick. Knives, lots of pretty knives and bright blood. The devil seeker watches bright blood and watches words. Poor, poor little watcher will spill guts and all.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The moon cries of the rising dark. Bright crystals for its wants. It sees, it knows where they are. Dark men with little hearts will find them and feed it. Little men with small hearts will take away all the bright pretty blood. Nasty men with little hearts will take away escape.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The stars whisper of a ancient spider weaving his designs while trickster dances just out of sight. Violet eyes hunt you in the dark. They want the warrior woman and the serpent book she has read. Shadow creatures are drawn to the eater of souls. They want and fear it. Their master needs it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Poor demon girl. Two mommies she has but violet eyes didn't know. Poor pretty demon girl. Made to hurt daddy who isn't she was. Violet eyes and his tricks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Pretty one with seeing ring. See through the masks. Pretty one Skelos is in your blood. Skelos of the magicians. Warm sun and butterflies now. Maybe your friend wants it more than you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* later - to Shandi - definitely use in story */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My poor pretty demon girl. I can feel it chewing in you. Can you feel me pushing it into the corners?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spider spins a web around the Doors. Sharp Lady stays true but are there enough knives?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* if they ask Valen about the Great Mother references and she replies - old seer embelishing */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Why do you lie to us? Soul Feaster cannot hold a Power.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* out of the blue - some time when Valen and the players are together - points at Valen and Verkal */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The spider hunts your friends. Spider wants dragon skin warrior and book in snakes dragon skin knows of.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* another out of the blue when Valen and party are together - points at Valen for this one */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Darkness hunts you. Through the ways between the Keepers come for the Eater of Souls.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Dru - if asked about the Keepers */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dead but not dead, they felt the sting of the Eater without being consumed. Chained to the Gates of Hell by the Eater and bound to the withered hand of a long imprisoned power. A power that would unmake everything were it free.</p>
