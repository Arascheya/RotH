<p class="pagecaption">Angelique (<a href="mereret.htm">Mereret</a> overlay)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Angelique Marsters, born 23 April 1866, disappeared 10 November 1895(adjust with <a href="../../hut_irena/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a> timeline), was the only daughter of Thomas James Marsters and Abigail Elizabeth Wellingham. She has one brother, John James, who is two years older than she is. Thomas had a modest fortune from his parents estates and from coal mines he owns on several of his properties in Newcastle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Abigail died when Angelique was 9. Thomas killed her with poison because he was sick of her teaching Angelique to be strong and self-willed. Thomas has always viewed his children as tools to be employed to gain personal power either through marriage or other forms of alliance. He is careful around Abigail's family to down-play this. As a result he has tried to minimize contact between the two families. Something <a href="lordwillem.htm">Lord Willem</a> has fought against.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Angelique was 12 Thomas married Victoria Trunchwell. Victoria is a hard and merciless woman. She has treated her step-children extremely badly. Thomas had a second son, Edward, with Victoria. Edward has been pampered and coddled from birth. It is Victoria's plan that he inherit the bulk of the Marsters estate. To this end she has begun a prolonged slow poisoning of John. The results have been a decrease in John's stamina and intelligence. She has also insisted Angelique be schooled in several of the more repressive finishing schools for young ladies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="lordwillem.htm">Lord Willem</a> and his family have tried to mitigate the situation for the children, especially Abigail's children. Angelique was brought to the Wellingham estates as often as possible. She became a friend of <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy</a> and <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a> even though she was four years older. She will become a much closer friend as she attempts to deal with the death of her family. She will also introduce <a href="dimentia.htm">Charlotte</a> to <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy</a> and <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a> at this point. The original Angelique was always jealous of <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy</a> and <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a> because their families valued them as girls and as intelligent persons. <a href="mereret.htm">Mereret</a> views them as close friends, confidants, and allies against the repression of the times that makes her crazy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Marsters home is in the <a href="../../common/place_images/belgravia_london.jpg">Belgravia</a> section of London's west side.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She has heard rumors of a Door under <a href = "../info/ciwl_etc.htm">ITC</a> and of the <a href="../info/doorkeepers.htm">Keepers of the Doors</a> from a drunk servant of one of the lesser keepers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For the alt. London stories of the <a href="../../hut_irena/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a> <a href="mereret.htm">Mereret</a> took her as an overlay 21 September 1887 near the Alhambra Theatre. Angelique was murdered by servants of her father after she announced her intentions to seek asylum with the Wellinghams for herself and the ailing Thomas. Thomas died by poison later that night before the overlay Angelique arrived back home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Game versions</p>

<p class="regtxt9">alt. London - new party, if they ever end up there</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Angelique is as written for the RotH stories - she disappeared as written and is a member of the <a href="../../hut_online/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a> crew.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">alt. London, used for previous party</p>

<p class="regtxt12">For the game Angelique is totally a <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a> of recent times. She has stolen the necklace from the museum and has only recently put it on. She is basically Drusilla without Spike. In the game Angelique has a porcelain doll that looks a lot like her that she calls Miss Edith. Miss Edith talks to her and tells her how to plan out her various strategies. Mereret will send a set of letters to <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a>, <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy</a>, and <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> after her encounter with them in the basements of Whitechapel.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mereret will send a set of letters to <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a>, <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy</a>, and <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> after her encounter with them after she first fights <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a>. She and <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> will become attracted to each other. They are both fascinated by the fact they cannot defeat each other.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The necklace gives her access to the memories of past wearers with the strongest being those from the latest owner, <a href="iskandera.htm">Iskandera</a>. This has made her curious about the place she came from and about dimensional portals in general. She desires to find one of the Doors the <a href="../info/doorkeepers.htm">Keepers of the Doors</a> guard to explore this further.</p>
