<p class="regtxt5">Mary Jane moved to Lofrida when she was thirteen and met <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissana</a> when she started school that year. They quickly became best friends and remained so even after Mary moved to Wahaii with her folks when she was seventeen. She has remained on Wahaii ever since, moving her home to asmall bungalo in Lanahaei on Kauawa.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary and Nyissana started surfing at the same time and rose through the ranks together. They competed in local events, each doing very well.Mary went on to compete internationally after her move.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As she got older, she diversified into starting a surf girl line of clothing and gear, then expanded into women's sports wear in general. She did quite welland now has a chain of stores and an online market for her stuff called Gracie.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She remains in contact with Nyissana and they are still best friends. Sometimes she consults with Nyissana if she isn't sure about a design.</p>
