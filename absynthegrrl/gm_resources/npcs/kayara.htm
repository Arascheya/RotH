<p class="regtxt5">Personality:</p>

<p class="regtxt9"><a href="../../common/npc_images/sgazelle.htm"><img src="../../common/npc_images/sgazelle_thm.jpg" border=0> Kaya (Trickster)</a>: gypsy allegria, fun loving, Meli with brains. The Trickster appears as a young woman with an open, radiant smile and the glint of mischief in her eyes. Her hair is jet black, her skin medium-dark, and she is usually dressed in <A href="../eritsani_inx.htm">T'Sani</a> young woman wear, long skirts, a skimpy but frilly top, and wearing lots of gaudy jewelry.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Yara: old gypsy seer, appears as OLD gypsy woman - she will appear in <a href="../places/val_exp/tzell.htm">Tzell</a> from time to time, usually coincides with the appearance of Vishina. She can also be used in any town on the rivers if the <a href="riverwind.htm">River Wind</a> is docked there. She will sometimes travel with the <a href="riverwind.htm">River Wind</a> to other towns.</p>

<p class="regtxt9"><a href="file:///z:/shapes/kaya_dancer.htm">Dancer</a>: seductive, high cha, associates only with <a href="sharyl.htm">Stormy</a> and old <a href="elentaryn.htm">fisherman</a></p>

<p class="regtxt9"><a name="vishina" href="../../common/npc_images/sgazelle.htm"><img src="../../common/npc_images/sgazelle_thm.jpg" border=0> Steele Gazelle/Vishina</a>: seductive, high cha, <a href="../places/val_exp/val_exp_inx.htm">Valley of Experiment</a> and <a href="../info/carnival.htm">Dark Carnival</a> variant of the Dancer persona, she dances at the <a href="../places/val_exp/diamondspider.htm">Diamond Spider</a> in <a href="../places/val_exp/tzell.htm">Tzell</a> two nights a week, every fifth week, three sets each night.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Vishina wears two rings. One ring has a small needle tipped with a substance called Skintwister which causes anyone injected to have violent convulsions for about five minutes. The other ring contains a powdered poison called Black Rapture which is lethal within 30 seconds of its ingestion. She will use the first ring on someone who playfully molests her; she reserves the second ring for the truly crude types. She also wears a long comb in her hair which she can use as a weapon.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Blind Seer of Jakara: She leans on a young urchin, probably a girl, but under the rags and dust it is hard to tell. The seer wears old robes, from a time when many wore more concealment and protection from the heat. Her hair is bone white, her eyes milky and filmed wth just the faintest tint of green fire in the depths. Her skin is leathery and seamed from too much wind and not enough water. She is a far cry from the water-fat populace of Jakara.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Appearance:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ht: 5'7". Wt: 130 Ibs. Age: immortal. Hair: black, Skin: medium-dark Eyes: dark jade green, lit with an inner fire - this feature remains constant across all incarnations except the blind seer in the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a> areas where her eyes are milky white, with a very faint green tinge - can be seen on a really good spot roll. These are eyes like no other that the players have seen and the appearance of them will make a strong impression.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Notes</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For new campaign - Kayara is aligned with Irena and the Hut in terms of balance keeping. She runs a travelling carnival, <a href="../info/carnival.htm">The Dark Carnival</a>, similar to the Ravenloft one, and has enabled the <a href="../gates_inx.htm">World Gate system</a> so she can use it. It isn't as easy or specific as the Hut, but it allows her to get around. Tyana set up the redirects and the smoke screen utilities so Elentaryn still believes the <a href="../gates_inx.htm">World Gates</a> are sealed. Sharyl made a big deal of asking him to allow Miskatonic U. to bring students in through a slaved gate in the basements of the school.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the Ancients aged each one aquired special abilities. Kayara can control the <a href="../gates_inx.htm">World Gates</a> using only her mind. <a href="sharyl.htm">Sharyl</a> is a natural majik user. <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> has enhanced technical skills, mostly hardware based. All three can access the Core of being, the racial memory, going back to the beginnings of the race on <a href="../places/karanal/karanaldata.htm">Karanal</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../info/kayaraholo.htm">Holo Message</a> - used when she appears as the blind seer of the <a href="../places/galhaiwaste.htm">Galhai Wastes</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kayara has developed skills allowing her the capabilities of a <a href="../char_type_info/facedancers.htm">Face Dancer</a> of Rune Lord status. She is also the trickster. Nothing delights her more than to set a plan in motion to point adventurers toward some new goal or problem. She is even more delighted if it flies in the face of <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a>'s carefully manipulated view of how things should progress.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is one of <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a>'s moms, the other is <a href="sharyl.htm">Sharyl</a>, also known as Stormy. <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> does not know this. As far as he is concerned he is <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a>'s father.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* as the blind seer in <a href="../places/lotus_empire/halwa.htm">Halwa</a> */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The darkness rises once more in the forgotten ruins of the Galhai Wastes. Evil oozes from the blackness, seeking footholds once more. Already there are those that have been tainted, living in the midst of us all. The dark forces rise again and there will be no balancer to save us this time. You must find a way to prevail.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* prophecy as the blind seer in Jakara */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have seen you. I have watched you from the purity of the desert. Your lives mock the prophecies. Death creeps at you from the shadows and still you dance the dance of oblivion. Watch the wind and the birds, see the death stalking on the wind and prepare, lest sand cover this place! Lest sand cover you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* prophecy as the blind seer in Pavis - OLD Campaign */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have seen you. I have watched how your lives mock the Prophecy. The Great Battle is still to come. The Dark Ones strive even now to own your souls. Even as I speak there are those among you who are already possessed. Yet you dance away your time in idle frolic instead of seeking the Holy Relics or any knowledge of what is required. You must arm and prepare. Your adventurers must seek the Holy Relics, your priests must pray for guidance, and you must prepare for Jihad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Behold this group among you, they are adventurers. They have been touched by the striving powers and have begun the journey. You, brave adventurers, stand at a crossroads in time. Much shall depend on you. Embrace your fortunes for all things further the Prophecy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You slothful folk look upon these brave souls and gain purpose. Aid them as much as you can, lest sand cover this place. I have spoken! The Gods have spoken!</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">YARA - another fragment if it’s needed</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A neutral power has touched you. You stand at a crossroads in a time when many forces are striving for power. Very little is certain and the outcome is clouded by too many omens, portents, and seeings. One force seeks ‘Planetary Defense Command’, another seeks to not submit to an old master, a third desires dominion, another strives to be free of an old curse, revenge and power is sought by the crazed one, another seeks to close what is open and open what is closed and free that which is long bound, and one seeks harmony and balance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Many things figure into the twists of these desires: ancient items known as the Well Artifacts, of which there are four, two have been found; an obscure tower dancing in shadows; 7 great orbs of power; a path of statues; a hut - larger within than without; a book bound in dragon hide with an odd name; and lastly a very special set of twins one who must be saved from magic by magic before she can  help.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/ Story Notes */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kayara and Stormy - take a far greater hand in things than would make Elentaryn happy if he knew of what they were doing</p>
