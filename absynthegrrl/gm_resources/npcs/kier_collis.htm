<p class="regtxt5">Lives in the <a href="../places/val_exp/val_exp_inx.htm">Valley of Experiment</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Physical Description:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Human male,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Ht. 6', Wt. 175#, Age.'27</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Fighting Prowess: Very Good with rapier and dagger, good with crossbow or stiletto.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Common Knowledge/Legend</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Keir Collis is the handsome merchant from across the sea who came to the City and swept <a href="veradis.htm">Veradis</a> off her feet. The dark-haired man took Nightshade Shipping over when her father died and has built it into an enterprise that rivals Premier Imports LTD (a division of the Forgeway Company). He's a shrewd businessman who knows how to make money. He's hired two full shifts of workers on his docks so they can unload ships around the clock. Collis pays his workers well and has decreased the amount of dock theft incredibly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Keir patronizes the local theatre. He buys costumes and commissions new works for them to perform. He has also given money to the Sailors' Aid societies and regularly contributes to the City's Temples.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Collis' life is perfect. He has a beautiful wife who dearly loves him and a successful business that makes him very rich. He shares his money with his workers and is always willing to help them during a time of need. He is a fine, upstanding citizen and a credit to the community.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Truth</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sewerspit!" A common City expletive. Sewerspit is as unpleasant as it sounds - a fermenting foam of the City's daily offal, floating, surging and stinking its way beneath the City's streets. Yet the worst of it can be found in one of the City's fine mansions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Keir Collis, working in a branch office of Nightshade Shipping - which he now controls - managed to engineer a stranglehold on the xtaze drug traffic into several key distribution centers. When he arrived in the City he explained to <a href="veradis.htm">Veradis</a>' father that he, Keir, had documents signed by <a href="veradis.htm">Veradis</a>' father that made it look as if the drug scheme was entirely his plan. He promised to destroy the documents if he was given <a href="veradis.htm">Veradis</a> as his wife, and made heir to the shipping company. Through <a href="veradis.htm">Veradis</a>, Collis became a legitimate part of City society and is currently above suspicion concerning any of his slimy deals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Collis works closely with crime lord Danny O'Grunnion and ships all of the Big Fish Gang's drugs into and out of the City (see CB3 for details). Collis is far too smart to use his own product, and pays his workers well so no one will say anything. O'Grunnion has also provided, in the form of discipline, reasons for the workers to keep quiet about Nightshade's dark night business.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Collis, in accordance with an agreement with his wife, has taken several lovers. Except for his current lover, <a href="oriana.htm">Oriana Web</a>, the women have left the City (though most of them have only gotten as far as the deepest parts of the City bay). Keir plays for keeps.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Scenario Suggestions</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario 1: Lord Finster Investigates.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My Lord Llwellyn Finster, special investigator for City's Justice Ministry has taken an interest Keir Collis. Apparently Collis's hands are not as "clean" as the drug runner thinks them to be. Yet, on the other hand Lord Finster has insufficient evidence to arrest, let alone convict a member of the High Society. Since Lord Finster fears corruption in the city guard, free agents, honest adventurers, are needed to infiltrate and expose Collis's criminal activities.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario 2: Dragon Enraged.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="rystya.htm">Ristya Darkbrow</a> is mad - mad enough to risk her ship, her business, even her life to discover which of her clients has been using her ship, the <a href="riverwind.htm">River Wind</a>, to ship drugs up river - and then make sure that slime never sells anything to anybody, ever again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">
During a routine custom investigation far up river, drugs were found in her cargo, destined for a mining town far to the north. The official knew <a href="rystya.htm">Ristya</a> and a small bribe purchased the woman's silence. Obviously, if the drugs were discovered, the shipper figured that the riverfolk would be blamed for them. For the first time, <a href="rystya.htm">Ristya</a> defaulted on a shipping contract. This cargo would not be delivered! Now, <a href="rystya.htm">Ristya</a> seeks vengeance for her honor and good name. No one, especially a human!, takes advantage of the riverfolk like that and lives to gloat over it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She hires adventurers to accompany her and her crew on a mission into the City to eliminate Keir Collis.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario 3: For Your Eyes Only.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Keir decides to take on the Forgeway Company. He hires the adventurers to break into the Blacksmoke research facility, far from the City. He arranges to meet them on their return at Crumbling Skull Rapids, where he has secretly hired a band of heavy duty thugs to eliminate any complications which the adventurers may cause later on. Of course, Forgeway goons cannot be far behind.</p>
