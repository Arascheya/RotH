<p class="pagecaption">Tyana Ivanova</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tyana is a dancer who works with <a href="uru_katya.htm">Katyarina</a> at the club. <a href="uru_katya.htm">Katya</a> talks her into entering the caverns after having gone a few times herself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider - estranged from parents - not from anything overt, more from emotional disconnect from some event(s) in her younger days. Has more trouble dealing with her indifference than anything that happens to them. Will sporadically talk with <a href="uru_katya.htm">Katya</a> about it, when something occurs where expectation and actual desire conflict. She often wonders if she isn't a sociopath, except there are people that she does care about and cry for if they experience hard times. Somehow the hallmark card happy family never seemed to fit with how she felt. What troubles her is that she can't pin down anything awful that happened, just a few instances where the shock of the parental reaction left her hurt, confused, and alienated.</p>
