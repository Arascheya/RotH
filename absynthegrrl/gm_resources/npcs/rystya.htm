<p class="pagecaption">Rystya Darkbow</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">this is older data - pre Ghost Wind crew</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rystya Darkbow is a river gypsy. She owns and operates the <a href="riverwind.htm">River Wind</a>, a passenger/cargo ship working the rivers of the <a href="../places/val_exp/val_exp_inx.htm">Valley of Experiment</a>. She lost her mate several years ago in a nasty altercation in Delgurkar and will not go there again. She had two sons by this alliance, Calyx and Corinth. She has recently taken a female lover, a dancer called the <a href="kayara.htm">Steele Gazelle</a>, who works at the <a href="../places/val_exp/diamondspider.htm">Diamond Spider</a> in <a href="../places/val_exp/tzell.htm">Tzell</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">She is addressed as "Ristya" by the other river gypsies, as "Captain" by the remaining crew, and as "Captain Dark" by most residents of the river ports. She is dark skinned with glossy black hair. Her eyes are so dark as to be almost black and her face is thin and arisocratic. Ristya always wears the same outfit in public, a dark purple close fitting top, black pants, and well worn deck boots.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">On the <a href="riverwind.htm">River Wind</a>, she wears an amulet of a dark green stone shot with fine red lines. A leather switch decorated with tiny shells hangs at her left hip, and she wears a thin, stiff piercing sword on her right hip. Ashore, she does not wear the amulet, and typically replaces the switch with a small quiver holding six arrows, plus a riverbow slung over her left shoulder.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ristya's amulet warns her when magical items are brought onto the <a href="riverwind.htm">River Wind</a>. It does not identify the type of magic, but does indicate to her a rough location of the item. It is keyed to her personally. It gives no warning to anyone else that tries to use it, nor does it warn Ristya of the presence of magical items that she has personally held. Thus, when a crewman has something of magic, he will bring it for her to briefly hold, so the amulet will not repeatedly sound the alarm each time the crewman steps back on board. Her switch is also magical, causing an intense shock when brushed against another person. The members of her crew quickly learn to obey her orders as Captain, and it rare that an individual ever needs to feel the switch a second rime.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Calyx (the more vocal of the two) does not trust this new relationship and thinks the girl is out to screw over his mom. He wants a full investigation into this woman and also wants to drag his mom away from her in any way possible. He doesn’t trust the new crew and feels they have bewitched his mom because only she or they are allowed into the engineering parts of the ship these days. He is very phobic, Corinth is worried but not nearly in the same ways as his brother.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="riverwind.htm">River Wind</a> - explosion (set by one of the <a href="../pharmacom/drug_treatment/xtaze.htm">Xtaze</a> smuggling groups after she refused to carry their cargo) destroyed the giant slug propulsion system and killed several crew. Rystya managed to obtain financing through <a href="ghostship.htm">Milo</a> for repairs, although the bargain had some parts in it that were hard for her to accept. The engine system was replaced with high tech equipment and <a href="ghostship.htm">Milo</a> provided the engineering crew to run it, also there was a proviso to carry a small carnival group, this ship will rarely carry passengers other than the small circus troupe and the captain’s lover</p>
