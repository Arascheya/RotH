<p class="pagecaption">Merris</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Runs Portal Dispatch for Death City/Eternia. She is also a friend of Kali and will become her lover as the story progresses. She is originally from Superior, Wisconsin and arrived in Death City after a near death/death experience on the Duluth ship cannal.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris - General Description - tangled blonde hair, she unconsciously runs her fingers through it whenever she’s nervous. Heart shaped face, pretty in a plain sort of way. Generous mouth, green eyes. Use images from altan cd - Merris is older and shows signs of hardship</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She was in a punk band in Duluth at the time of her death, however she was thinking about quitting anyway. She had gotten tired of the constant screaming and the lack of musicality of the band she was in. She craved dynamics and melody once in a while. Once she arrived at Death City she became so involved with Portal Station and dispatch that she didn't really think of music again until Nausea was talking about something missing from her latest band. When she described it Merris became interested again and finally asked if she could drop by a rehearsal and hear what they were doing. What she heard appealed to her and she began rehearsing with the band. This was about the time she met Kali. She has not yet performed with them, that will happen after the first time Kali sees them perform at the Cathouse.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris was a wild one in her home town. She rarely went home after she turned 12. She could be found living with her friends. Her father was a drunk and her mom a workaholic. She had no siblings. Most of her time was spent either with Catherine Curran or the punk band members. She was an average to poor student, mostly through boredom rather than lack of ability. The only place she applied herself was playing fiddle, and then not so much in school as with Catherine. Catherine considered her almost a second daughter. Catherine's own daughter wasn't interested in music. she wanted to be a game designer. Melissa Curran was two years older than Merris so she left for university to study CS before Merris graduated high school.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For some of the Celtic fiddle style think Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh of Altan or Eileen Ivers. Her voice is more haunting and etherial than Ennui or Nausea. Ennui has the harshest of the voices, she will back off singing as Merris becomes more comfortable. Ennui will sing mostly on the really harsh and thrashing kinds of things.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After high school she worked waitress jobs and coffee shops and made a small amount from the band. Most of the others were spoiled richer kids, whose parents kept them in community college and beer money. When Merris was 21 Catherine had a dibilitating stroke. Once when Merris was visiting Catherine in the hospital after another episode she asked Merris to help her go since her relatives wouldn't. She also  helped several others out as well during the next two years. It aged her and contributed to her current appearance in Eternia. She will sadly joke to Kali that she was playing the angel of death in real life. The Lady will have Kali reassure Merris that it was the right thing to do. Merris won't believe it until <a href="belladonna.htm">Belladonna</a> from Love's Bitch recognizes her and thanks her for the release.</p>
