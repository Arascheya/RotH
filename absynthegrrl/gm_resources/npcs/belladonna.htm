<p class="pagecaption">Belladonna - Juliqayan (Juli) Bethany Demryths</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bella plays keyboards for <a href="loves_bitch.htm">Love's Bitch</a>, including the theatre organ once it is operational. Bella looks like <a href="../../common/club_images/bella_lb.jpg">cave-buffy</a> and appears on stage as a <a href="misc_data/brides.htm">Bride of Frankenstein makeup</a>. She and <a href="nausea.htm">Nausea</a> are lovers. They are also very quiet and private people so the rest of the band knows very little about them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Belladonna is one of the old people <a href="merris.htm">Merris</a> released in Duluth. Once <a href="merris.htm">Merris</a> joins the band Bella will slowly start to recognize her. Once she does she will thank <a href="merris.htm">Merris</a> for her help. This is when <a href="merris.htm">Merris</a> first truly believes she did good as the "Angel of Death".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bella was an actress for most of her life. In her declining days she returned to her home in Duluth and remained active as a sponsor and guest artist for the local community theatre groups. She went into the hospital after a serious stroke.</p>
