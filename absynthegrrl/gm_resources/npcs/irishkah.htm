<p class="pagecaption">Irishkah</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irishkah is the Tiefling proprietess of <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a> and a descendent of <a href="iskandera.htm">Arascheya Iskandera</a>. <a href="iskandera.htm">Arascheya</a> and her lovers, Mary and Steve, founded <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a> long in the past of <a href="../places/planescape/centrys.htm">Sphere</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irishkah is a steady and kind boss and an able administrator. She has brought <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a> back to prominence and prosperity after several generations of less capable management. She is always available to talk with clients, inmates, staff and <a href="../info/flowers_sphere.htm">Flowers</a> as needed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irishkah is not afraid to use her special operatives to promote and protect <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">Asylum</a> interests and personnel. If another party comes and asks for assistance, she will detail operatives to their cause if it is in the intests of <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a>. The cost of loaned operatives is extremely high and operatives are always instructed to walk from the third party if they are asked to work against <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">Asylum</a> interests. There has been one case where other operatives were sent in to extract loaners from a third party mess. The highly visible retribution has discouraged any additional instances of abuse of <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">Asylum</a> operatives.</p>
