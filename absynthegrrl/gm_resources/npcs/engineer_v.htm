<p class="regtxt5">The engineer is a tech savy being from one of the Realms. It was hanging in Centrys by accident after it opened a Door by mistake. It looks vaguely Shadow-like and is a brilliant engineer. It was in trouble with the Watch and looking for a way out when Lord Wellingham's group appeared. It agreed to echange tech for escape and has remained in London ever since.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It is beginning to become restless and longs to return to its own place and time.</p>
