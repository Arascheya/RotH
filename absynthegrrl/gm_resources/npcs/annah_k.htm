<p class="pagecaption">Annah Kovachi</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Annah is a very unhappy person, fleeing from a life she sees as empty and dead end. She committed suicide to escape an abusive relationship, a dead end job, and felt there was no way out.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her shade hangs near the abandoned tracks where she died, waiting for something... The wait is several months from her death. By the time <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> arrives she is not quite completely mad. She used her father's ceremonial dagger. She will not let go of it. It remains with her everywhere she goes until she can finally surrender it to move on at the end of her story.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> and The Lady argue over the inclusion of suicides in Death City. The Lady taking the traditional approach of "No, she was a quitter." <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> believes everyone deserves a chance to heal. Annah is a test case that <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> and The Lady agreed could happen.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">On her arrival she slowly decides she wants to heal, then work toward a chance at the Summerland and rebirth.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Annah's body is decaying and falling apart. Near it is a faded weathered statue of the Goddess Kali she stole from a nearby shop. Her soul has been crying out that name since her death. This is what called <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> to the location.</p>
