<p class="pagecaption">First Slayer - Daughter of Sineya</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Possession:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Is supposed to be ritually induced at calling by Watcher</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Has not occurred properly since 1500’s</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It has happened occasionally be extreme stress conditions in a slayer’s life. In this case the binding is incomplete and the ‘personality’ of the First and previous slayers fights with the personality of the current one. This usually leads to madness and death. This can take a month to six month depending on the strength of will of the current slayer.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">‘Personality’</p>
<p class="regtxt9">The First One is predatory and primal. Her task is the killing of demons’ vampires, and the rest. She has a very linear view of this except she is also drawn to the darkness she fights. In many cases the slayer she inhabits will end up with a vampire lover of some form. It has happened far less since the council stopped the linking ritual.</p>
