<p class="pagecaption">Ron Oestrander</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ron is the foreman of <a href="../places/eternia/emetals.htm">Eternal Metal Works</a>. He was an automated factory maintenance worker in the Realms. In Eternia he is foreman of a bustling older style metal works facility. He enjoys the hands on nature of the work. He is in excellent shape. Gruff but nice enough underneath. He rules his realm with the iron fist in a coarse burlap glove. Those that have worked with him and know his quirks love him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In his spare time he cycles around the city to stay in shape.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He is older with a lined face. His arms are corded with muscle and he is tanned dark brown. There are laugh lines around his eyes and concentration marks on his brow. What hair he has left is bone white. His eyes sparkle with devilish amusement most of the time. All in all a face with a great deal of character and still handsome.</p>
