<p class="pagecaption">Irena Valinskya</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Uru Live KI: 01749896</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena is 5'6" tall, on the thin side, with black hair and brown eyes. Irena is a "hard body", enjoying working out to reduce stress, first of school, then of managing bars and property. She is fascinated by Nyis's surfing past. She has a copy of the center chest tattoo that Jaime and Nyisa have, in honor of their friendship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Older sister of <a href="uru_katya.htm">Katya</a>, friend, and roommate of <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a>. They worked together at <a href="../places/waverlys.htm">Waverly's Pub</a> before <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a> was hired as a software designer for at <a href="../info/cycore.htm">CyCore Games</a>. Irena also knew <a href="jsolitaire.htm">Jaime Solitaire</a> when she was at university with <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She and <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a> are close when they don't have other people in their romantic lives. They have been known to share a few of the more open minded ones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She keeps her notes, in <a href="../../docs/GameTales/urulive/diary_irena.htm">diary form</a>, encrypted on her laptop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a> tries to talk her into working at <a href="../info/cycore.htm">CyCore Games</a>, but Irena remembers her boredom with the repetitive nature of game building from when she entered a <a href="../info/cycore.htm">CyCore Games</a> world building contest for Forever City. She had planned an adventure around the food trains and the outside, but only submitted a shadow of her design because of the immense amount of work the full project would have taken. Irena still fiddles with the modding tools because they are easy to use, but she has no plans for a full adventure package anymore. She uses it as a tool for creating background areas for action stories she tries to write. She does agree to be a tester and consultant for Realms of the Hut when Jaime asks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena has always been a bit of a dabbler. She learned locksmithing from a friend of her mom's, while in high school. She also took auto shop and found she was very good at it. She started in the Business deptment, at university, but couldn't stand the accepted practices. She moved on to engineering, but it bored her. She earned her massage license, but only uses it for friends.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She never finished a degree before Tom promoted her at Waverly's. Irena loves Waverly's. She likes bartending, talking with the regulars, and juggling the financials. She embraces O'Malley's empire and operates it with a calm, competent, and steady hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The women of Irena's family are pretty wild. Her mother was an unwed mother and surgeon. She fell in love with Leanne when they were both in high school and they have been together ever since. She remains in touch with Irena's biological father, who lives in the university town where Waverly's is. Her grandmother was a burlesque performer until the show faded due to changing social norms and her father died, leaving her the large victorian house in the town Irena grew up in. Grandmother moved back with her daughter and her daughter's lover, telling a tale of the death of her husband and passing Leanne off as her other daughter. Great grandmother had been a brothel keeper until she was forced out of business, again by changing social norms. Great grandfather had been an industrialist and had lots of money.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena's mom appeared as the center girl in the men's rag that Irena appears in as one of the Girls of Goth and as a center girl. Her "friends" are scandalized that she would allow herself to be "exploited" in such a way. Her mother is proud of her and encouraged her to take the chance. "It's only skin, dear. I have never regretted stepping out. And it didn't keep me from being successful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena asked Nyissana to accompany her to the first shoot, the Girls of Goth one. The photographer was intrigued by Nyissana and asked if she would participate. Nyissa was uncomfortable at first, because of her scars, wondering why the photographer would even ask. The photographer noticed how the two interacted as Irena helped persuade Nyissana. When the main shoot was done, she asked if they would mind a few together shots. When she saw how hot they were together, she passed them each a card with "Pheadra Queensly" on it, adding, "I have a side project where I create erotic entertainment in a woman friendly way. I think the two of you would be awesome on screen. Give me a call if that is something you would be willing to explore."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena's moms were quite supportive when Irena mentioned the offer. She had called to let them know which magazine and issue she would be in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena and Nyissana did a couple of amatuer pornos, Casting Goth 5 and Lesbian Space Vampires, with Pheadra. She made it very clear Irena and Nyisanna could return any time they desired. Irena and Nyissa were incredibly hot together, since they love each other on top of it all. Think of a really hot casting couch video with one guy and two or more women. If Stacy were to know, she would shun Irena.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena fixed up an old <a href="../../common/item_images/uru_shan_spyder.jpg">sporty car</a>. She liked the looks of it and it was a distraction from university and Waverly's. She takes it to the local track and does laps, striving to improve her skill and her time. She has raced it, but rarely places and never higher than second. As she tells it, "I don't have the fire. I like going fast, trying to push myself, but I don't care if I win or not. It's just about improving my skill." She removed the convertible top, added a hardened roll-cage, fabricated a fiberglass cowling for racing, toughened the suspension, tweaked the engine to the max, added a racing transmission and clutch, and refitted all the brakes. She bought it in poor shape and spent months working on it. She tested the roll-cage by rolling the car on her fourth time out on the track. She walked away because of the cage, but had to spend several more months rebuilding the car. She would have stopped driving if Ted hadn't forced her into his car, after making sure she was ok, and made her do several more laps.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She has taken Nyissana to the track many times. Nyissana uses the track to help reduce her fear of cars and driving.</p>
