<p class="pagecaption">Irena Valinskya</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Uru Live KI: 01749896</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena is 5'6" tall, on the thin side, with black hair and brown eyes. Irena is a "hard body", enjoying working out to reduce the stress, first of school, then of managing bars and property. She is fascinated by Nyis's surfing past. She has a copy of the center chest tattoo that Jaime and Nyisa have, in honor of their friendship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Older sister of <a href="uru_katya.htm">Katya</a>, friend, and roommate of <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a>. They worked together at <a href="../places/waverlys.htm">Waverly's Pub</a> before <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a> managed to get hired as a software designer for a local game software house. Irena also knew <a href="jsolitaire.htm">Jaime Solitaire</a> when she was at university with <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She and <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a> are close when they don't have other people in their romantic lives. They have been known to share a few of the more open minded ones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She keeps her notes, in <a href="../../docs/GameTales/urulive/diary_irena.htm">diary form</a>, encrypted on her laptop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a> tries to talk her into working at CyCore, but Irena remembers her boredom with the repetitive nature of game building from when she entered a CyCore world building contest for Forever City. She had planned an adventure around the food trains and the outside, but only submitted a shadow of her design because of the immense amount of work the full project would have taken. Irena still fiddles with the modding tools because they are easy to use, but she has no plans for a full adventure package anymore. She uses it as a tool for creating background areas for action stories she tries to write. She does agree to be a tester and consultant for Realms of the Hut when Jaime asks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena was a dabbler at university. She started in the Business deptment, but couldn't stand the accepted practices. She moved on to engineering, but it bored her. She earned her massage license, but only uses it for friends. She never finished a degree before Tom promoted her at Waverly's.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena loves Waverly's. She likes bartending, talking with the regulars, and juggling the financials. She embraces O'Malley's empire and operates it with a calm, competent, and steady hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The women of Irena's family are pretty wild. Her mother was an unwed mother and surgeon. She fell in love with Leanne when they were both in high school and they have been together ever since. She remains in touch with Irena's biological father, who lives in the university town where Waverly's is. Her grandmother was a burlesque performer until the show faded due to changing social norms and her father died, leaving her the large victorian house in the town Irena grew up in. Grandmother moved back with her daughter and her daughter's lover, telling a tale of the death of her husband and passing Leanne off as her other daughter. Great grandmother had been a brothel keeper until she was forced out of business, again by changing social norms. Great grandfather had been an industrialist and had lots of money.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena's mom appeared as the center girl in the men's rag that Irena appears in as one of the Girls of Goth and as a center girl. Her "friends" are scandalized that she would allow herself to be "exploited" in such a way. Her mother is proud of her and encouraged her to take the chance. "It's only skin dear. I have never regretted stepping out. And it didn't keep me from being successful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena did a couple of amatuer pornos, Casting Goth 5 and Lesbian Space Vampires, at university for walking around money. The producer made it very clear Irena and Myisanna could return at any time, their segments were very popular. She didn't tell her mom right away. Did she tell her mom, or did her mom find it when she and her girlfriend were surfing? When mom finds out, she is pleased, not angry. Would Nyissa have been interested or accepted as a partner? Scars are a minus, but Irena and Nyissa together would be very hot, since they love each other on top of it all. Think of a really hot casting couch video with one guy and two or more women. If Stacy were to know, she would shun Irena.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">CONSIDER: does Irena have something before the <a href="../items/HutSummonGem.htm">Summoning Crystal</a> that would link her to the Hut?</p>
