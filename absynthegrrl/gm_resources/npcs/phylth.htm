<p class="pagecaption">Phylth - previous player character</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Phylth comes from the region near the Isle of Experiment. She was a player character in the Dhar Ankes/Oriz scenario and one of the first iterations of the Hut. She was from a group of Shape Shifters - of the were-tiger clans.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* the following is some rough data on what was going on in this scenario/campaign package */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* transport to Hut - Minstrell of the Dawn was major clue holder at this point - the players enjoyed Gordon Lightfoot, so the song list was heavily his - plus there was a sharing of earth souls and Zelp souls in this campaign */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Phylth-</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You awaken in a room with walls, floor, and ceiling made of a silver metal with a lime green tinge to them. The room is lit with bright white light from square panels in the ceiling.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You feel as though someone has placed your head in a vise and squeezed, but the feeling is not physical, more like you have had too many things happening all at once and your mind has shut down and is now just beginning to wake up again. You have vague recollections about incredible sights of pasts, futures, and alternate "nows". None of the images are clear enough to actually remember.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">About twenty feet away from you you see a male human with curly light brown hair, going slightly grey, a close trimmed beard and he is wearing close fitting leggings/breeches of a blue colored coarse fabric and a woolen shirt with a checked pattern of bright colors. On the floor next to him is a strange wooden device, with strings, similar to a lute but with a different body shape.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As your head starts to clear you realize the overstuffed, squeezed feeling in your mind is because there seem to be two of you in there now. There is you, Phylth, and then there is this entity that goes by "Doc". This other entity seems to have come from a very different, strange place. Very few of the images this entity has in his head resemble anything you have seen or heard of. The only common point at this time is that this entity is as disoriented as you are. Communication between the two of you is possible in the form of pictures and thoughts but you can feel that either a dominance battle will have to occur sometime soon or the two of you will have to blend together in some way if both of you are to survive this experience.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Doc-</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You were in the middle of a typical night at the flight lines when you felt a wrenching, twisting sensation and blacked out. You woke up somewhat when you heard voices talking near you. What you heard is the following:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">male voice- "I hope this works this time, the last batch were totally unacceptable and incapable of the adaptations required. I need a technical type involved in this project and none of the so called techno types I've evaluated are up to this."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">female voice- "I hope so too Boss. This search operation is very difficult to continue. What shall I do with the physical form?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">male voice- "Suspend it in case we need it for anything. My companion assures me we will be able to do the insertion when the Second Triad transfers. Transfer in 5...4...3...2...1"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Then everything went black again until you woke up when Phylth did.</p>
