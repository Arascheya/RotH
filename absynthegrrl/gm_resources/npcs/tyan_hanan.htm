<p class="pagecaption">Tyan Hanan</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tyan Hanan started life as Tyanyana Fezetha, one of the evacuees. She was pilot of a survey crew scouting other locations around the new world when her ship experienced severe malfunctions and crashed. Tyan and Aratakama Inridys were the only survivors of the crash. Tyan was badly injured, paralyzed from the waist down by the landing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Local proto-Tuar't'zani tribesmen found them after their chariot had fallen from the sky. They named her Tyan Hanan and her friend Aratakama became Takima, her consort. Her ability to speak, using her translation system, and her fall from the sky convinced the tribesmen the two were something special.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her political sophistication, coming from the highly evolved worlds, gave her an early edge. She built her tribe into a cohesive and focused force that soon bound other tribes through gifts, diplomacy, and wealth into a unified tribe of desert nomads. She encouraged them to become the desert trading force they became. By the time of her death she was a revered and beloved leader, considered the Mother of All by the Tuar't'zani.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tuar't'zani - started by Tyan Hanan near 320 BC - as camel caravan peoples - this can be shifted depending on what is needed to fit this in with evac arrival and the other areas they impacted. Write up a Tuar't'zani entry when more data is decided on.</p>
