<p class="pagecaption">Felicity Fiona Anders</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Felicity Anders is <a href="shae_anders.htm">Shae</a>'s mother and the owner of Madam Felicity's Tea Room. The Tea Room is a new-age store, tea shop and room, and a place for psychic readings. Felicity has owned it since the death of her husband, using his insurance money to buy the store and the apartments above it. She rents three of the apartments and modified the front two into the family residence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Felicity was the office manager for Stark Entertainment before starting up the shop. She doesn't make nearly as much money, but she is quite a bit happier in her new work. She favors faux gypsy garb, patterned mostly after bad movie interpretations, but has made it her own.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Felicity and <a href="edward_s.htm">Edward Stark</a> have started seeing each other in a romantic way, however, both are confused by the new relationship. Edward has also been asking her to return as the number two position in the company. Felicity has no idea what to do at the start of the story.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The shop is staffed by her, Shae, and three college students, one of which may end up staying on, dropping out of anthropology to study the occult and magic.</p>
