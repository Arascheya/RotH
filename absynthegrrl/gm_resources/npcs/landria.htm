<p class="pagecaption">Landria - previous player character</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Landria comes from the region near the Isle of Experiment. She was a player character in the Dhar Ankes/Oriz scenario and one of the first iterations of the Hut.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* the following is some rough data on what was going on in this scenario/campaign package */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* transport to Hut - Minstrell of the Dawn was major clue holder at this point - the players enjoyed Gordon Lightfoot, so the song list was heavily his - plus there was a sharing of earth souls and Zelp souls in this campaign */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Landria-</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You awaken in a room with walls, floor, and ceiling made of a silver metal with a lime green tinge to them. The room is lit with bright white light from square panels in the ceiling.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You feel as though someone has placed your head in a vise and squeezed, but the feeling is not physical, more like you have had too many things happening all at once and your mind has shut down and is now just beginning to wake up again. You have vague recollections about incredible sights of pasts, futures, and alternate "nows". None of the images are clear enough to actually remember.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">About twenty feet away from you you see your ghost friend, although he looks slightly different now. He has curly light brown hair, going slightly grey, a close trimmed beard and he is wearing close fitting leggings/breeches of a blue colored coarse fabric and a woolen shirt with a checked pattern of bright colors. On the floor next to him is a strange wooden device, with strings, similar to a lute but with a different body shape.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As your head begins to clear you feel as if some part of yourself is missing but other parts are even more complete than they were before. As your head clears even more you realize part of the confusion is some of the thoughts you thought were yours are actually those of Aria and Mia.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* concerning her father - something she is looking to find more about */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Elandrial, your mother, told you this about your father:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When I was younger, a handsom young arcane came to our village while searching for an Artifact of Zat'ak, a diety of the city he was from.  his grace and good humor, along with his love of adventure appealed to me.  We went around together for most of the time he was here and when he was ready to leave I asked to accompany him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We left the next morning, heading towards the old dwarven city in the mountains.  The one that had been abandoned long ago.  As we tried to enter a horde of Orcs streamed out and fell upon us injuring us both very badly.  As we crawled and stumbled away from the battlefield we eventually collapsed at the edge of a clearing.  When later I awoke, I found myself in the jut of an old hermit woman.  She told me that your father had died of  his injuries while I was recovering.  We buried him near her clearing and sadly I came back home.  It wasn't until I arrived home that I knew I was pregnant with you.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Your father's name was Ariander the Seeker.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* From the Necklace on atunement */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"My daughter, I only hope this spell will work on an enchanted item.  The old woman lied to your mother.  I did not die.  The old woman has kept me alive to fulfill some sort of prophecy.  She says soon I will be released but will remember nothing of you or your mother.  She said something about bears but I am not sure...she is coming..."</p>
