                1) - One at the point where the docking collar access and the landing assembly access meet. This one is a three way access point. There is one  hatch that leads to the crew and control sections of the ship, one that leads to the access ways, and one that leads to a coupling into modular personnel carrying modules that can be installed in the cargo bay. This hatch doubles as a crew to cargo bay access point.<br>
                2) - One in crew/control area - This leads from the crew docking collar to the crew/control section of the ship. It also doubles as an EVA hatch  during flight. There are a set of docking clips near this collar that are used as a station attach point for docking.<br>
                3) - A secondary one at the junction between the crew/control section and the cargo/hyperdrive module - Normally this airlock functions as the  pressure door between the crew section and the cargo section. During separation it provides a landing level crew access.

<p class="regtxt5">Ghost Wind is a Stock Light Freighter (SLF) with a payload of 520,000 lbs. Ship gross wt. Is 2,500,000 lbs. The additional weight is in the added superstructure needed for atmospheric entry and the additional hardware required for the separable crew/control sections. The ship has three independent sections. The first is the main cargo section. The second section is the shuttle and control section. This section is used to transport cargo from planets that do not have orbiting stations or support for stock freighter landings. The last section is the crew quarters. This section can be separated from the main cargo section and survive independently. This section also contains personal escape pods for the crew in the event this section is no longer habitable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../info/dsc.htm">DSC</a> originally had a design concept for a segmented ship structure. The idea was they could design a fairly standard crew/control section and then link it with various cargo handling modules. They had gotten as far as original design and prototyping when their competitors did a major price cut. <a href="../info/dsc.htm">DSC</a> was forced to rethink their design based on a much lower per unit sale price. They immediately rushed into an altered production methodology but had several of the almost finished prototype units in the system. They welded the segments together, didn’t complete the auxiliary engineering sections and sold them as early versions of their main product line. The container segment designs were kept and crew/control sections were added as permanent structures. The resulting ships were reasonably priced and more durable than their competitors designs, thus saving them from a nasty slump in sales.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ghost Wind is one of 3 modified segment design ships still in service. <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> has gone to great expense to fit her out to the original design concept. Thus Ghost Wind has the detachable crew/control sections. She has used it a couple of times to land at facilities that would not even support a light freighter and where local shuttle capability didn’t really exist.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She has used this to her advantage as a niche market strategy, which has kept her in the <a href="../places/karanal/fringesys.htm">Fringe Systems</a> and farther from her father’s notice. Although a year before she met <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a>, he had contacted her through her mother and asked that she consider loose affiliation with his fringe fleet. He had to grudgingly admit she was a respected independent, with the ability to fill a service requirement his main fleet couldn’t. His part of the bargain was to pay her far more than several shipments were worth to allow her to pay down most of the notes she was carrying from refitting her ship. He provided her with several electronics and computer updates so he could have her do a smuggling run now and again. He didn’t involve her in any extremely hazardous ones though - he does have a great deal of concern for her as his daughter, although he still hasn’t completely forgiven her for running away from her responsibilities inside Drakon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ghost Wind has most of her cover panels off in areas where there is a lot of circuitry and control equipment. Sturdy pads cover corners and landing points that are strategic when navigating her in no gravity situations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The landing assembly/station docking collar airlock leads to a narrow ladder shaft that climbs to the secondary airlock between the cargo/engineering section and the crew/control section. It opens into one of the corridors leading to the bridge and to crew sections. There is a cargo pressure door pair leading from the shuttle cargo section into the main cargo bay for transfer of cargo when the crew section is functioning as a shuttle. Opening this door usually requires full docking and equalization. It can be over ridden if both cargo sections are at the same pressure as the surrounding environment. Sometimes this is done when multiple loads are being lifted with the crew module. This way the docking procedure doesn’t need to be executed before cargo is moved. The cargo must be able to withstand the environmental pressures encountered in this situation. There is also a crew hatch just aft of the bridge on the port side of the ship. It is set up to handle a docking collar connection or for use as an emergency exit on the ground. Ground access is either through the cargo bay or through the nose landing assembly area.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Crew access to the shuttle cargo bay is through a separate pressure hatch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Access to the main engineering section was through a pressure hatch leading to the entry ladder shaft. Main engineering could also be reached by EVA and then in through an emergency evacuation airlock into the control section. Emergency escape gear sufficient for four persons is directly accessible from main engineering control. The primary power system can be jettisoned in emergencies. It is a matter/antimatter reaction system that feeds the field generating equipment. Antimatter containment faulting would automatically trigger a jettison. Secondary power generation is handled through a heat exchanger system and turbines. <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> has installed the secondary power upgrade to power heavier weapons and shields.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ghost Wind was constructed as a ‘family’ ship, meaning she was fitted to handle 5 to 20 people in spartan comfort. There were 8 cabins and a galley capable of seating and feeding 10 at a time. Water and air cleaning and storage were calculated to provide a reasonable rate of processing even with all 20 crew aboard at the same time. Two cabin and four cabin modular units could be added in the shuttle cargo bay area to increase personnel capacity to 24. It could be pushed to 30 if everyone didn’t mind being somewhat uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> has a large amount of plants in her cabin. Most are varieties of the very expensive Tyranthilus Void Plant. These plants were developed and engineered by <a href="../info/tyr_botany.htm">Tyranthillium</a> botanists to flourish in low/no gravity climates. They were being developed as an alternative to mechanical air scrubber units for space stations. Several wealthy patrons popularized their application as decorative plants in their ship yachts. Soon the botanists were producing the commercial strains for use in scrubbers and a new line of various varieties for decoration. <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> saved them a couple of times by providing emergency shipping when the corporate they usually used couldn’t. She has first right of refusal on any of their contracts that she could service.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She has several flowering and vining varieties growing in her cabin. They derive nutrients from their air cleaning duties and require a misting of water every so often. They have microhairs that grab and hold moister passing over their surfaces.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the later <a href="../info/dsc.htm">DSC</a> units the cargo and engineering sections were converted to straight cargo capacity and isolated with single pressure doors from the main cargo holds. The engineering access way was sealed off at the engineering end and the space was used for additional crew storage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside the command/living module is a riot of color. <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> has painted the exposed conduiting and cabling in various intense colors. Murals and other brilliant designs cover most of the surfaces. Some of them are quite good. Scanning the entire collection reveals a progression of style - as it should, considering she painted all of them. <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> has a small sitting/contact room, bed chamber, and head all clustered just under the bridge. There is a hatch between the two that she leaves open when she is alone on the ship. Sometimes she will forget and leave it open when <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> is around since she is so unused to having others on the ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">Eritsani</a> symbols and myths form the basis for some, others are just pretty patterns and experiments with color and form. It is somewhat overwhelming at first to those not of <a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">Eritsani</a> lineage. </p>
