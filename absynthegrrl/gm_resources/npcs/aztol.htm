<p class="sectioncaption">Notes:</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">New Campaign Notes</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aztol was the youngest cousin to the Tolaz family in the Valley of Experiment. The main Tolaz family was wiped out, when he was about twelve, because they were sacrificing people to the dark demons to gain power. A group of Arcanes and Merchanters organized the raid, using their various household contingents. The slaughter was frightening. None from the village survived the purge except Aztol.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During his explorations as a child he had come across an access point to the Ancient's Way that ran beneath the village. He used this to flee when the butchery began. He fled west and ended up on the Isle of Research. There he managed to persuade the Mad Techno into training him in the ancient ways.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the mad Techno discovered Aztol's twisted, nasty view of humanity, he attempted to exile him, dying in the process. Aztol retained the Mad Techno's island for his base, however, many of the Mad Techno's creations were destroyed in their fight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Elentaryn launched an attack against Aztol, destroying much of the island's facilities before forcing Aztol to flee. This would have been after the World Gate debacle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aztol captured Seal Team6 from the Gate Dimension after fleeing Zeltrop. He took control of the commander, using a stolen brain scan system. He killed any of the crew that would not help him and forced the controlled commander to train new recruits.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Tech:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Special Forces troops are equipped with equipment based on the US land warrior system. This includes built in imaging system (video, night vision, and majik detection), comm. system (voice and heads up data display), positioning system including friendly and suspected enemy locations, and telemetry links back to the Spider Ship. They are also equipped with smart weapons capable of "seeing" with IR and majik detection devices. These weapons link back to the helmet system allowing forces to use their weapons to see around corners and into other hostile places without exposing themselves.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Regular troops are equipped with comm. gear and positioning indicators so Special Forces can determine where they are in battle situations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Currently possesses the Spider Ship of Ishra. He has Ishra held captive through the use of a brain scan unit and a Keeper type organism which allows him to retain control of her mind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Aztol fled his base of operations was secured by <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> and <a href="sharyl.htm">Sharyl</a>. They have transfered most of the equipment to <a href="ghunayya.htm">Ghunayya</a>, a former associate of Aztol. They have checked her out and believe she is honorable enough for them to deal with. So far she has not betrayed their trust. She is <a href="ghostship.htm">Milo</a>'s contact for equipment and information. <a href="ghostship.htm">Milo and the Ghost Ship</a> are her far ranging eyes and ears.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Older Data</p>

<p class="regtxt5">son of 2 heretics caught teaching knowledge of the Ancients in an area where this was prohibited. The local population believed that knowledge and technology were responsible for the current poor state of their world. He and 2 friends were out exploring when the secret police gathered up his family but happened to witness the death of his father and humiliation of his mother. They were exploring an ancient site of some form.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Early in his life he fell in love with a girl named Maranda in Altaarkrn. It didn’t last. As he aged he became more twisted by what he perceived to be failings in the world around him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He swore to gather enough power and people to extract vengeance. He has somehow acquired a bit of knowledge about the access tile on <a href="../places/karanal/karanaldata.htm">Karanal</a> and desires info about it, along with the Cobra Book history said to reside in the Gardens of Lazaar. He created what he believed was a viable world gate controller and tested it on a party of adventurers. What he didn’t realize was they were under <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a>’s personal protection. He was forced to lead a rescue mission to get them back. He lost <a href="krystal.htm">Krystal</a> on that mission and then found out she had known about the <a href="../cobra_inx.htm">Cobra Book</a> he was searching for. He was driven completely mad by the high handed treatment he received from <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> over his failed World Gate controller. He has captured and reprogrammed Ishra, demoness of spiders.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> makes him rescue the group stranded by his failed gate controller, he does it, then snaps over completely. Maranda has no idea what to do for him and mostly has to watch helplessly as he goes more and more over the edge. When he manages to capture Ishra is when she leaves, actually she leaves just after <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> is brought to him. She knows enough about it to help <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> and <a href="kayara.htm">Kaya</a> track down traces of her. <a href="krystal.htm">Krystyl</a> has already disappeared through her almost death during the rescue. His favorite line becomes - "I’m going to squeeze his nuts until they pop" He does retain a cunning brilliance though, rather than degenerating into a complete mad fool.</p>
