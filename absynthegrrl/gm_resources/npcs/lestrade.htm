<p class="pagecaption">Inspector G. Lestrade</p>

<p class="regtxt5">b. 25 Jan 1853</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Geofrey Lestrade becomes a friend of Angelique's after the Marsters murders. He never quite shakes the feeling she had more to do with it than he could find out, but manages to not hold it against her. She might eventually level with him if circumstances become strange enough. She would have to demonstrate her abilities to have it make sense to him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lestrade's father was a miner in the copper mines of Parys Mountain. He was killed in an accident when Lestrade was ten. His mother, struggling to keep herself and seven children alive, sent him to an aunt in a tiny village near ancient druidic ruins. This aunt was on his mother's side and steeped in the older religions. She is a pratitioner, although, she tried to keep it from young Lestrade, trying to school him in the dominant ways so he would find an easier time in adulthood. This worked reasonably well until his 15th birthday when he surprised her during a ritual. He pestered her until she told him everything, including her visions, which had grown more intense as she aged.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He moved to London when he was twenty and joined the police force after witnessing a particularly brutal mugging when he arrived. He spends time with his aunt, when he can, and discusses cases with her, when he can. She has helped with several by way of her sight. This was one of the things that started him down the path of inspector.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Angelique facinates him. Some of it is her strength, some of it is her seeming to be far older than her apparent years. She is a way for him to understand the Wellinghams and through them, the rapid changes happening as the precursors to the <a href="../info/mega_ascend.htm">Mega-Corp Ascendance</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">After the ripper killings Lestrade is promoted to Chief Inspector.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After the ripper killings, Lestrade and Mere will become lovers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lestrade is good friends with <a href="petrie.htm">Dr. John Petrie</a>. Petrie is the actual author behind the Holmes stories. He uses his medical knowledge and the investigative skill of Lestrade in crafting his tales. He portrays Lestrade as a bumbler in the Holmes stories as an iside joke between them, and, as he says, to keep Lestrade humble. They also use the stories to get people thinking about how science can help in crime solving.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lestrade learned to observe from his aunt and her interactions with magic. Petrie learned it as part of his medical training. They both use their skills heavily, although Lestrade has to be careful. The dominant police protocols of the day are, round up the usual suspects and coerce one of them to talk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lestrade will become one of the <a href="../info/doorkeepers.htm">Keepers of the Doors</a> through his connections with <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> and the <a href="lordwillem.htm">Wellinghams</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lestrade will be a key figure in Scotland Yard's creation of M.I.D. - Majik Investigations Div. - for dealing with sorcery and other majikal incursions. The need is clarified by oncident around the Hut, the Stonehenge gate project, and the Doors. This div. also contains any magic using personnel the yard employs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After Angelique disappears in the Hut, he will retire from the Yard, marry, buy Aurthur and Son Booksellers, renamed to Lestraed and Petrie Booksellers, with his friend John Petrie, and raise a family. Sometime near his retirement he is injured saving the Wellinghams from political forces seeking to destroy them, and the beginnings of the Mega-Corp Ascendency that Lord Wellingham has started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">CONSIDER: Mereret will find his wife for him. They will have been friends. Marries <a href="mary_kelly.htm">Mary Kelly</a> after solving of ripper murders. They became friends through Mere. Mere loved her as a friend and worried about Mary and Lestrade growing old without children, which they both wanted very badly. Mary was born in 1863 and is 25 at the time of the attacks.
Lestrade should be 30 around the time of the ripper killings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Data below is from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lestrade">wikipedia entry</a> for Lestrade</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the popular London media, Lestrade is depicted as one of the best detectives at Scotland Yard, chiefly because Holmes regularly allows him to take the credit for his deductions in cases such as "The Adventure of the Empty House" and "The Adventure of the Norwood Builder". In truth he was already well-established as a respected policeman with 20 years in the Force before A Study in Scarlet. It is observed by Holmes that Lestrade and another detective, Tobias Gregson, have an ongoing rivalry, and he identifies the two as "the best of a bad lot ... both quick and energetic, but conventional - shockingly so." Holmes once remarked in "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box" that although Lestrade had almost no skill at actual crime-solving, his tenacity and determination are what brought him to the highest ranks in the official police force. His conventional nature leads him to grow frustrated at Holmes' methods, becoming "indifferent and contemptuous" to his exploration in "The Boscombe Valley Mystery". In both "The Boscombe Valley Mystery" and "The Adventure of the Norwood Builder", he states that he is "a practical man" in dismissal of Holmes' apparently trifling actions. Nevertheless, Lestrade's appreciation of Holmes' methods grows - likely aided by being credited with Holmes' successes - and by the time of The Hound of the Baskervilles Watson observes "from the reverential way in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the days when they had first worked together."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Additionally, despite a disregard for Lestrade's single-mindedness, Holmes appears to have an affection for the detective. In The Hound of the Baskervilles, Holmes comments to Dr. Watson that Lestrade "is the best of the professionals, I think," meaning the professional detectives employed by Scotland Yard as opposed to himself, and it is Lestrade more than any other official that Holmes works with. In "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons" it is revealed that Lestrade regularly drops in on Holmes and Watson at 221B Baker Street, sharing the news of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Yard">Scotland Yard</a> and discussing his current cases with Holmes. For his part, Lestrade gradually develops an appreciation of the detective's methods, going so far as to say at the end of the story "We're not jealous of you down at Scotland Yard. No, sir, we are proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow there's not a man, from the oldest inspector to the youngest constable, who wouldn't be glad to shake you by the hand." Watson notes in passing that this little comment is one of the few instances where Holmes is visibly moved.</p>
