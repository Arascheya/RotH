<p class="pagecaption">Ali (Alice)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Born somewhere were attitudes are somewhat backward. She lived with her mother and never knew her father. Her mother's sister Jeanette would watch her while her mother was at work, trying to keep enough jobs to pay for food and their tiny apartment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jeanette was always telling Ali she needed to accept Jesus. Ali never had anything against Jesus, but was pretty sure he wouldn't think much of Aunt Jeanette and Uncle Billy, especially when everyone found out Uncle Billy was the reason her cousin Nita (Anita) was preggers at sixteen. Nita died from complications with the pregnancy because Jeanette wouldn't take her to see a real doctor, instead she was convinced there would be divine healing of any problems.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ali had tried to get Nita to get an abortion or see a doctor on her own, but she never did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ali didn't do well in school. She was dyslexic and the local district didn't have anyone that knew what to do to help her. She took to skipping by the time she was in high school, resorting to drugs to get by and forget about the dead end life she saw ahead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She would go hide in the no longer used sections of the asylum above town. One of the basement windows in the empty section had been boarded up, but not well enough. She could pull the board back and slip inside. Her happiest memories were prowling the empty rooms and halls of that building. She came across a storage room filled with abandoned property of inmates that had never left. She amused herself for hours imagining their lives and times based on the contents. Littered about her favorite room were sketches and drawings of her imaginings. Strangely, her drawings were quite accurate, tapping into actual memories and echoes of the people she was imagining. This was the main deciding factor in her recruitment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her first psychotic break came when she was seventeen. The state checked her into the asylum on the hill above town, where she stayed in a drug haze until it was closed down. That was seven years later, although Ali died just before being released through an accident with her meds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She lives in the empty asylum located on a spur between Death City and Goth City. It looks like the Athens Asylum, only more run down on the outside as well. Her room mirrors her favorite room in the abandoned part of the asylum where she died.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alice is a haunted and sad soul. She sees too much and has absorbed too much despair to ever be particularly happy. Her tasks in Death City have gravitated to "reading" found items for hints and ideas about the culture the items came from. She can answer questions about what was important, where would the best preservation items be, and what did the culture consider its highest achievements. She does this through the memories of the owners of the items brought to her. She can go to various worlds and read directly, hower, like Dementia and the visions, the sensations are often too intense.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She can be found at the asylum, the hall of records, or at the absynthe parlor. Once in a while she will wander either Death City or Goth City whne looking for something new to wear or when she craves company. She often prefers to be alone with her thoughts and tends to be a slightly sad, almost ghostly figure.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">using photos from JackSilver found locations</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is from the model - cmulcahy about herself - use the concept for Ali:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I think this photo could probably fit into a thousand categories here.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">It is different than the normal business I post. While I am slightly worried about scrutiny and imperfection comments, I think I have more to gain than I do to lose. I know I do not have super ripped abs, I know I probably should have not attempted such a photo. I also know that I am real. It is time I start to feel as real on the outside as I do on the inside. Normally, I would have seen such a shirt, and turned my back on it. Learning to reveal myself confidently is always a struggle with me. I feel this way in class with my hidden opinions, in relationships where I try to give far too much, with my lack of comfortability with my sexuality.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Everything has a different meaning somewhere. As long as there is meaning, things matter. The problem is, meaning is everywhere for me.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">What is the meaning of this revealing image you ask?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This photo reminds me of a client from long ago. I did respite care of a little boy for several years who had severe medical issues, and among them he had a permanent G-tube, as he could not always keep down medicine. We played video games, ran around the yard, played music, colored...etc. I remember my 16 year old self being so aware of the self consciousness of this boy young because of his illness. He had a BUTTON (g-tube) but no one else in his small little world had one! (sometimes it feels as though I put myself in small little worlds where I am the only one who has something too) My how he was alienated. Until one day...he asked to see my button. Oh god! going into a conservative household, and revealing a belly piercing nearly 10 years ago was quite a step. So...I thought it was only fair...to show him my belly button. To his surprise... was not that far off from his adornment.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I became part of his world (and probably his first love) because he was not alone. He was so proud of this discovery...that he proceeded to share this comparison with his mom! ahah! He later had the g-tube removed, after we were no longer working together. :)</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This one is for you G.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Because no one should be afraid to show their button :) :giggle:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Children can teach you the best lessons.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Life is such a beautiful discovery. It is amazing when you can pause long enough to find that you are not unlike those around you.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">(for example) - This modeling world I have found myself in feels so empty and plastic sometimes.I am so overwhelmed by looking my best, making sure my roots are dyed, finding the right outfit...etc. It is nice to find a friend to just be 'real' with. I really have not been able to do this in a way that has restored my faith in the system. Back home I have my lovely friends =JackSilver and `khavi. Both of whom I adore playing photos with. I can just bring a pile of clothes do `khavi and she makes some sort of colorful madness or optical illusion with a matching backdrop. I can just sit around in my pjs with =JackSilver and make my most :+fav:ed image to date. I miss that more than anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">But that part of my life is gone. I have been going through a slight identity crisis in my new location adaptation. I think *rjcarroll saved me the other weekend, when he came out just to create and play. It was nice having the opportunity again to just ...be real. A month without this chance makes me go craaaazy.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Anyway...I think that is what this image is. Real.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">No prepping myself with diets or exercise as I have been consumed with school, no dying my roots, no plucking my eyebrows. But this also goes to show...that spontaneity, realism, humanism, and perhaps a tiny bit of vanity<br/>
can<br/>
have<br/>
meaning.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">sorry for the rant. I am tired, and my mind is busy.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">photo thought provoking and momentary confidence provided and inspired by *rjcarroll. (I was super psyched when he told me my belly was not photoshoped)</p>
