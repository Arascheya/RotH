<p class="pagecaption">Nightshade - Margaux Ellaine Sommers</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Nightshade looks like Faith. She wears a wife beater and appears on stage in cat morph makeup.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Nightshade is somewhat quiet but cuts loose easily once she isn't hidden behind her drums. She likes the relative anoniminity of her makeup and will change clothes as well once she removes it. She has been known to slip into the audience after a show and just sample the comments.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Nightshade is also the brew mistress at Skull and Bones Brewing Company. They provide most of the beers for the Adam and Eve as well as to the Cathouse once it opens.</p>
