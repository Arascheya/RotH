<p class="pagecaption">Mortiss</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mortiss came from Ennui's dimention. He was killed in one of the first attacks on Death City by the proxy gods.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mortiss fancies himself a devotee of the vampire mythos of goth-dom. He is extremely sqeamish though, disliking the sight of real blood in any amount. Oddly he becomes one of the better field medics in Eternia. Mortiss covers his squeamishness with a total bad boy attitude. He is sort of like Doyle from Angel. Kind of bold and a bit brash, fancying himself a bit of a lady killer. He is actually fairly compassionate and respectful to the people he gets to know and like.</p>
