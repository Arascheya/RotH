<p class="pagecaption">Margla - M'Lara Sherzada</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Appearance:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She usually appears as an old woman bent and twisted with age. There is still traces of the beauty she had when young evident when the evil force doesn't have full power.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Notes:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">M'Lara was a hyperdrive design engineer at the main hyperdrive development facility before the evacuation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Margla was "born" when M'Lara and the Mad Techno were experimenting with a modified hyperdrive. This is the composite being that was formed when <a href="she.htm">She Who Must Never Be Named</a> from Centrys was bonded with M'Lara during the experiment. A third entity, a <a href="../monsters/demons/consumer.htm">Consumer</a>, was also introduced into the bond. It is what wants the flesh and spirit of sentient beings for food. It is not always in control, sometimes M'Lara can wrest control back. <a href="she.htm">She Who Must Never Be Named</a> is also subject to the effects of this and is the third member of their triad. Shortly after the formation of this triad <a href="she.htm">She Who Must Never Be Named</a> gave Margla a ring that would help keep the creature subdued. This ring was lost during the battle at the School of Skelos between the school and Nyigroth.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">During the battle at the school <a href="../items/souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a> tasted Margla, forming a type of bond between it and her. It has just a tiny little bit of Margla, <a href="she.htm">She Who Must Never Be Named</a>, and the <a href="../monsters/demons/consumer.htm">Consumer</a> demon tied to it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="she.htm">She Who Must Never Be Named</a> created a second ring for herself and began tutoring Margla in the theories and practices of dimension majik. It was her hope that Margla would be able to find a way to undo the triad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Margla has had at least two daughters. <a href="krystal.htm">Krystal</a> and <a href="ghani.htm">Ghani</a>. These two were by separate fathers and were fathered to fulfil the prophecies given her by <a href="kayara.htm">Old Yara</a>. <a href="krystal.htm">Krystal</a> is the older and was left with a nomadic family in the deserts of the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>. <a href="ghani.htm">Ghani</a> is younger and was left at <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a> in <a href="../places/planescape/centrys.htm">Sphere</a>.</p>
