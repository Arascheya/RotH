<p class="pagecaption">Maggie Welch</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Archeologist, recovered from the wreckage of a collapsed temple. Killed while working in an area where a stray bomb landed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She needs a place to stay and Kali offers the use of her place for a few days. Maggie stays and they become friends. Maggie helps keep Kali from imploding when Merris is at Portal Station. They join a nearby gym so Kali can keep in shape for dance and Extractions.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Maggie Welch is a take no prisoners kind of person. She will get up in the face of anyone that tries to restrict her or mess with her. She is a quiet roommate, doing her share of the tasks but not particularly needing of attention or company. Think of Bill in many ways for this.</p>
