<p class="pagecaption">Georges Nagelmackers (1845 - 1905), Industrialist (Modified)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Born in Liège on June 24, 1845, Georges Nagelmackers was the founder of the <a href="../info/ciwl_etc.htm">Compagnie internationale des Wagons-lits</a> and the famous "Orient-Express" (Paris to Constantinople) and "Nord-Express" (Paris - St. Petersbourg).</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Born into a family of bankers and industrialists, Georges Nagelmackers was already managing the industrial fortune of the family bank while he was continuing his education. While on a trip in the United States, he was impressed by the comfort of the sleeper cars designed by Georges Pullman. To compete with Pullman who was attempting to conquer the European market, Nagelmackers decided to make comfortable and luxurious trains which would cross the whole of Europe. In 1870, he launched a project to include sleeper cars on European railways and founded the "Compagnie internationale des Wagons-lits". In 1872, the first sleeper cars were operated between Paris and Vienna, on the line that would later become the Orient Express. It was a resounding success. He was then granted licences to operate between Ostend and Cologne, Ostend and Berlin and between Paris and Berlin. In 1876 he signed agreements with the rail companies, supplying 53 carriages equipped with all the necessary materials, from the bed linen to the crockery. In 1882, the first restaurant-car was operated on the Marseille - Nice line. The Orient Express came into being the following year. The line connected Paris and Constantinople (nowadays Istanbul), former capital of the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. In 1884, Willem Wellingham buys controlling interest when Nagelmackers requires additional cash to support his growing empire. Willem forms "International Transportation Consortium" to manage it. ITC was awarded contracts to organise official visits for the majority of European royal houses. The contract for travel by royal families meant that the prestige of the company and its founder became international. In 1896, the Nord-Express came into service. It linked Paris, Calais and Ostend to St. Petersbourg and Moscow. Preoccupied with the development of trade links, Georges Nagelmackers also founded and chaired the Belgian Chamber of Commerce in Paris. He also participated in the foundation of the Société industrielle pour l’exploitation des fours à coke de Tilleur (Liège), a company which became a leader in the steel-making sector.</p>
