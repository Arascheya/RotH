<p class="pagecaption">Fyodor Borusa - aka Dr. Henry Jekyll</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../../non_pub/a-victorianlondon/map1895/l/l35.htm">London Residence</a> Shandy St. in L-36 on 1895 map. He has residency at the <a href="../../../non_pub/a-victorianlondon/map1895/l/l33.htm">London Hospital</a> at M-33 on the 1895 map, about .8 miles from his home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fyodor Borusa was thrown into the alt. earth timeline when an alchemical experiment on his world of origin went wrong. It was an experiment with lightning and power systems. Think concept of "apparatus" from Gryphon Hill mixed with something that could accidentally open a gate and throw him through. He lands near the docks where <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> can find him, feel the oddness on him, and rescue him. He had been studying medicine as well as alchemy. The aparatus was supposed to be part of a regenerative chamber, if things had worked right.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Through one of the quirks of the multi-verse, Fyodor looks enough like Henry Jekyll that he can assume Henry's identity and position. <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> will coach him through the social puzzle of london and his place in it. At first this will require quite a bit of her time, however, he is a quick study and has most of it figured out after a couple of months.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fyodor is a passionate doctor and researcher. He is intense in his desire to better the conditions of his patients and improve medicine overall. He reads voraciously and has brought several innovations from his past residence. He also is far more accepting of women as equals than his London contemporaries. This is from women having a better standing in the world he came from.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Where is Borusa From?? */</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Henry Jekyll - original person</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Henry Jekyll was mad in a quiet, dangerous, invisible way. He was trying to develop a treatment for addiction and the personality issues around it. His cure was to be chemical based, easy to administer, quick to provide results, and able to work without the effort or consent of the target. He would collect homeless people from the areas around London Hospital, take them to his lab, and administer the various test batches. Most of the subjects died immediately from reactions to the drugs. A few lasted a little while, but often went mad in either suicidal or extremely depressive ways.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jekyll would dispose of the bodies off the various landings along the Thames. If he were observed, he'd select the observer as his next test subject, or kill them outright. He was a serious misogenist and had a sadistic side that enjoyed torturing women. To this end, he would cut up his women victims. The ripper killings were his work on local prostitutes, a vice he abhored almost more than addiction to drink or drugs. <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique's</a> sampling revealed he thought leaving the corpses of the whores would serve as a warning to the "degenerates" and prompt them to enter work houses or other more "acceptable" means of betterment.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Older Data</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* the straight from alt. earth background isn't bad, but it doesn't explain why Ang would find him interesting enough to rescue */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fyodor Borusa came from Moscow by way of Brasov, Roumania. He studied alchemy and medicine under a master located there. One of the master's items was a group of books from a place far to the east. These are transcripts of some of the Zeltropian texts hidden in the Chomolhari complex. How they came to be transcribed and delivered to Bran Castle is unknown. The data in them has given Borusa medical knowledge far beyond the current London level and makes his entry to London Hospital extremely easy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During the settling in and transition phase of the house in London, <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> masqueraded as Jekyl while Borusa was introduced as a long lost cousin. When "Jekyl" resigned his position at London Hospital he recommended Borusa as his replacement. Evaluations supported this recommendation and Borusa moved into the hospital staff.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> finds him near the London docks after being attacked by several street thugs. A vision fragment reinforces his worth and prompts her to slide him into Jekyl's circles.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Borusa returns to teaching in the lab and lecture theatre that is part of his new home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Borusa is fascinated by the ITC conglomerate and by the owners in particular. He finds the idea of women as equals to be strange and very interesting. Sometimes he struggles to overcome his upbringing, but he will treat Lucy far better than any of her other suitors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* original data */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fyodor Borusa looks like a distinguished middle aged Russian gentleman when he is not disguised. Currently he is employing a <a href="..\items\changlingnet.htm">Changling Net</a> to look like Henry Jekyll. This net is causing him some focus and personality issues when he uses it for more than a few hours a day. He is charming and polite. He has swept <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Miss Lucy</a> off her feet, rapidly turning her head away from Arthur.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Redesign Jekyll place - house in front, lab in back across a courtyard. there is a passage to the side street that leads to the courtyard. this is where the cadavers for the previous doctor were brought in. this was not used much until Jekyll is replaced with Borusa, then Borusa begins bringing in shipments of various items and parts. He also strips the seating and risers out of the theatre and makes it into the large room where his device gets placed. retain the cabinet above as a place to retreat to. The household staff only see him as the replicant of Jekyll, although they must wonder at the materials flow suddenly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Borusa arrived Jan 1 <a href="../info/1800stimeline.htm#tardis_crash">1889</a> - at the end of the Ripper killings. This is when he took over the role of Jekyll. He was thrown into this world as he sought to escape from the invasion of his and arrived in Whitechapel near the London Hopital. <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> was nearby when he arrived and took him in and helped him based on a vision she had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Borusa was a medical research doctor where he came from. This allows him to further the work of his predecessor and enables him to fulfill his role at London Hospital. He can pull up enough charm to convince Jekyll's friends that he is the real item. He next sets his sights on some new alchemical creation which drives him back into a quasi-seclusionist life style.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Borusa is fascinated by the ITC conglomerate and by the owners in particular. He is trying to figure out how to best fit in this world he has been thrown into. Angelique can help through her contacts with the Wellinghams and can provide him the info necessary for him to cope with his new life. <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy</a> intrigues him most of all. He is drawn to her for her beauty and her brains.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Story only - or not at all: He also has doctor bugs in what he grabbed on the way to escape. These creatures heal through a curious burrowing through their patients. As they pass through their secretions promote rapid healing as they eat the diseased and damage tissues of the temporary host. The effect is masked by a natural anesthesia, however the skin near where they are working writhes and crawls of its own accord as the bugs do their work. Requires a save on sanity otherwise the patient loses 1d4 sanity points.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Borusa is one of the few survivors of a world <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> invaded. <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> was looking to gather more high tech items and knowledge. He escaped through an experimental portal as it was being destroyed. He hopes the data on how to make it work was destroyed as well. He was able to prevent <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> from gaining any of the research data on this style of dimension travel. He remembers little about what happened.</p>
