<p class="pagecaption">Imhotep - 2650-2576 BCE - 3rd Dynasty</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Imhotep was an early watcher. In his exhibit are several items that refer to this. Watcher’s council will want to see these. <a href="mereret.htm">Mereret</a> will want to recover these to see if there is anything about vampyr hunters in them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are several scrolls and items in the collection at the British Museum display that refer to <a href="../items/talis_anubis.htm">Angelique's Necklace</a> and the <a href="../items/shandi_anklet.htm">Anklet</a> <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> has. There are also several texts that refer to the Great Old Ones and other Cthulian concepts. In particular there is one that is desired because it contains the ritual to activate a Cthulian Gate similar to the one at Stonehenge.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">External data sources <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imhotep">Wikipedia article</a>, <a href="http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/imhotep.htm">Tour Egypt data</a>, <a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/flash/smith/smith.html">Medical text attributed to Imhotep</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Thought to have died during the reign of Huni, 2599-2575 B.C., at a very old age. May have lived through four pharoahs.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">
Djoser - reigned 2630 - 2611 BCE - for Mereret stories, Imhotep was 20 at the start of Doser's reign. Mere was age 6.<br/>
Sekhemkhet - reigned 2611-2603 BCE<br/>
Khaba - reigned 2603-2599 BCE<br/>
Huni - reigned 2599-2575 BCE - died in this reign in 2576 at the age of 74. Mere was 60 at the time of his death, looking no older than her time of change at age 25.
</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Had vast medical knowledge for the time, better then Hypocrates of the Greeks. Mereret was instrumental in this, using some of the fragmented data in Iskandera's memories.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Partner for part of his life - Ronfrenofert</p>
