<p class="pagecaption">J'Anya - captain of the Antigone</p>
<p class="regtxt5">J'Anya was born on one of the medium prosperity cities. Shortly after she acquired the Antigone the city followed one of the deeper currents, seeking more wealth. When the city returned to the normal currents it was empty. No trace of any of the citizens was ever found.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">J'Anya's family were "heretics". They believed that magic was a science and had developed as such. Her family had a cache of the old books detailing magical research and thought. As far as J'Anya knows, this cache still remains at the abandonded family home.</p>
