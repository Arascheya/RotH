<p class="pagecaption">Vashi Kala Dechen Ristan</p>

<p class="regtxt5">director/owner of <a href="../info/rani.htm">Rani Corp.</a> - she started it, she runs it - she has the thought crystal ring from the high elder of the evacuation</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Remember to add the notes about her finding the complex, her grandmother's necklace (required for access), the build-up of the Rani Group, and the becoming a nation-state of her own.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was the second oldest of ten daughters in her home village in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan">Nehtan</a>. Her parents were quasi-settled gypsies, living in a village for three months out of each year and wandering the rest. This arrangement allowed them to claim Nehtanese citizen ship, entitled them to health care, and access to education. Vashi did well enough to be awarded a scholarship for technical studies based on the standradized testing instituted by the Nehtanese Prince. This is what got her to the Meriksas and a chance to study.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Vashi has a high mechanical and engineering appitude. She was helping her family earn through fixing electronics, gadgets, and tuning engines from soon after she could hold tools.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Vashi's mother, Dechen Prashasa, is the youngest daughter of the Prince's family. She does not talk about how she was able to mary a common wanderer and remain with him. This connection was instrumental in the formation of Ranistan when the <a href="../info/rani.htm">Rani Corp</a> began to massively expand. Relations between Prince Khesar Prashasa and Vashi have been good. She remembers visits to the palace during her childhood. Because of her relationship, she had to perform better than the other scholarship applicants to avoid accusations of favortism.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During her youth she was extremely active in pro-gypsy politics, attending rallies, supporting advisorial candiadates that stood on a pro-gypsy platform. She was arrested several times, but usually kept only overnight. In the Meriksas, she was as active in pro-wanderer politics during her under grad terms. She started working for a political action group during university, switching to a tech firm when the PAC waffled and evaded on the really tough issues. She brought her drives to the tech world and sucked down knowledge like an empty sponge. During the summers she interned with a research group. This position returned her to the mountains above her home where she found the access point to the Zeltropian facility.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Access to the facility granted her the tech leaps necessary to create the Rani Empire and the mega-corp it became.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider: started in a very poor family. Many people in tiny place, yet it was the happiest time of her life. She'd go back if it were possible.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Personality - she has some of the adama loyalty to the people around her - she will try to help and protect those that are under her command and does her best to help as she can. will make the hard calls, even as she suffers the pain of them - can be cold but is not capricious - she and Valen share some of these traits. if she were to meet Valen, they would recognize each other in their actions and the look behind the eyes. like Valen, she can kill, but doesn't like it, although the dislike won't stay her hand if she feels it needs doing</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Likes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yak_butter_tea">butter tea</a> and misses it terribly while at university.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Vashi is ten years older than <a href="jsolitaire.htm">Jaime</a>, <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a>, and <a href="uru_irena.htm">Irena</a>. This has given her the time to get Rani Corp to its current financial stature.</p>
