<p class="regtxt5">/* Need to figure out when she becomes Dementia and why */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* from the "official" Lottie Collins data - see also <a href="misc_resources/LottieCollins.html">Additional Resource</a> and her page at <A href="http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/music_hall_tour/music_hall_stars/collins.php">People Play UK</a> */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Lottie Collins began her career in 1877 in a skipping rope dance act with her sisters, Lizzie and Marie. While in America in 1891 she heard what was to become her trademark song, ‘Tar-ra-ra-boom-der-ay!’. She sang it at the Tivoli in London and it became a major hit. Lottie would pause after the demure first verse and then whirl into an uninhibited version of the skirt dance. Her legs flashing in high-kicking Can-Can style steps would reveal her stockings held up by sparkling suspenders. This sent the audience wild and left Lottie exhausted.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Skirt Dance</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Skirt dancing was made famous by Kate Vaughan the 1880s. The dance was based on the graceful manipulation of the skirts, which could contain up to 12 metres of fabric. Skirt dancing was thought to be refined, tasteful and tantalizing. It was said that the motion of skirts rippled like the froth on the sea (such were the voluminous underskirts that Victorian ladies wore). Because it was less specialised and more lady-like than many dance forms, society ladies were able to learn the skirt dance as drawing room entertainment.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The sensational, uninhibited nature of the dance and the expanse of exposed leg drew complaints from the Puritan league, but music hall audiences loved her and she became a symbol of the ‘Naughty Nineties’. One hundred years later her garters were sold by auction at Sotheby’s. Although she performed other songs and sketches, Lottie was forever associated with her one song. The exhausting nature of the dance may have contributed to her early death in 1910 at the age of only 44. Her daughter José became a star of musical comedy.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In AU London she never marries, but did have three daughters. She is a friend of the Wellinghams and her children are offered education and opportunities as unofficial relatives. Jose was the most famous, following her mother into stage and later to screen. The other two daughters, Annabella and Miriam, were younger and followed their aunts into business at ITC.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the Realms Dementia was born Charlotte Louise Tate on the 23rd of May, 1866. Charlotte became a famous Music Hall performer during her life. Her stage name was Lottie Collins. She was most famous for her song and dance number performed to  ‘Tar-ra-ra-boom-der-ay!’ which she learned while on a trip to America in 1891. She was killed in the basement of the Alhambra Theatre on the 3rd of May, 1910 and buried in the St Pancras & Islington Cemetery. At the time of her death she was married to Music Hall lyricist J. Tate and was survived by her husband and daughter Jose. She was recruited at her death.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia is the main bar tender and manager of the <a href="../places/eternia/devilscathouse.htm">Devil's Cathouse</a> in Death City. She is a Goth grrl who takes no shit from anyone. Besides being the chief bartender she is also the manger and principle controller of the club. She came from an alternate earth in the 1890s, about the time of Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia is a tall, willowy, Morticia Addams looking young woman with dark brown hair and brown eyes. She favors the simple close-fitting black dresses and pale makeup forms that enhance the look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia is happiest running <a href="../places/eternia/devilscathouse.htm">Devil's Cathouse</a>. Like <a href="joe.htm">Big Joe</a> she enjoys tending a public house and providing a release for those doing the heavy work. She goes out on missions very infrequently. When she does though she prefers extraction missions over regular missions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia is bisexual. Currently she is partnered with <a href="ennui.htm">Ennui</a> for love and as protection against debilitating nightmares.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia lives in a flat above the <a href="../places/eternia/devilscathouse.htm">Devil's Cathouse</a>. She has the larger of the two tower suites. Dementia prefers India influences, brighter colors, intricate patterns, and delicate traceries. Candles and incense for mood. Brass work more than heavy iron work for fixtures and ornaments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia is a Seer. <a href="merris.htm">Merris</a>, chief of dispatch, relies heavily on her for visions of impending disaster, in the hopes she can get an Extraction Team out in time. <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> found this out once when Dementia was involved in an Extraction and began to describe the locations where the team to be rescued was trapped. When the full team comes along she will only go on Extractions where she has visions of necessary information.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia is a sensitive and so regular rescues are hard for her. Without the immediate need to provide information to the Extraction Team she begins to see the deaths of the local populace. The visions are vivid and detailed. Often including all of her senses. If left for too long on a dead world she will rapidly approach insanity. She believes the data about the dead worlds that Death City Metro visits is important. She writes down the data from her visions and was instumental in getting the Hall of Records organized. Now a team of recent arrival historians has taken over the day to day workings of it. They send various of their number out with each rescue to catalog the information that isn't contined in the recovered items.</p>
