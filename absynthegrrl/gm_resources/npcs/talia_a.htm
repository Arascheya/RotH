<p class="pagecaption">Talia Arakov</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Talia is a nerd girl, constantly on her laptop, either gaming or fiddling the web presence for her father's store, <a href="../places/arakov_market.htm">Arakov Market</a>, a high end organic produce place with several satellite locations around Yew Nork. She is an avid fan of <a href="../info/cycore.htm">CyCore Games</a> and follows everything the studio has a hand in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia is 5'8", pretty, with an exotic face that doesn't quite match any ethnicity. Her background is <a href="../monsters/demons/tiefling.htm">Tiefling</a>. She hides behind glasses, grunge style clothes, and a complete disinterest in looking attractive. The glasses are an affectation, she really doesn't need them. To the world she has light blonde hair, pale skin with lots of freckles, and green eyes. When she is beyond the veil, in Sphere, or other planar aware areas her hair is pale white, her skin medium latte with faint reddish undertones, her voice a bit on the raspy and low side, small horns poke up through her hair, she is more willowy than voluptuous, and moves she with an aura of distracted etherealness. She has brilliant green eyes that are very expressive of her moods.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia and <a href="kilashandra.htm">Shan</a> became friends when <a href="kilashandra.htm">Shan</a> started working at the main store back when she was in high school.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia volunteered as a FoA-like person for Conflict for Mars and The Shadow Journeys. She was a strong contributor in terms of tools, documentation, and customer support. She rose through the ranks to be the highest level non-employee in the group. Some of her contributions were marketing ideas that <a href="../info/cycore.htm">CyCore</a> had not thought about. When <a href="sophia_n.htm">Sophia</a> went missing, she was offered the position of Community Relations and Pre-Game Lead for <a href="../info/roth.htm">Realms of the Hut</a>. She agreed as long as she could work remotely. This was accepted although she does have to travel to <a href="../info/cycore.htm">CyCore</a> periodically for meetings and training. Travel is covered using corporate assets, meaning either the corporate train car or aircraft.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia's mom is Marissa and her father is Rade. (use RadeSerbedzija for images)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marissa is a high priestess of Ishra and holds small services in a chapel in off the Mirror Souk. She is descended from the gate people, those that survived in the gate dimension after the Sisters created it for Ishra and those sucked out of a doomed world with her. Talia's mom came through a gate and met Artemis, fell in love, and stayed. They have several children besides Talia, however, Talia is the most effected by her heritage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia plays Aeryn Solaris, Commander Plaizaar Regiment, second in command to Nazrah in Conflict for Mars. She and Shan wrote the book on tactics in-game. They have been playing since launch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia is a nerd girl - she loves tech and games. She keeps to the background in places where she isn't comfortable, unless tech-people are involved and she wants to discuss something with them.</p>
