<p class="pagecaption">Diane Lestrade</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Diane is older than her brother, <a href="ange_lestrade.htm">Angelique</a>'s father. She lives in the family apartments above Lestrade & Petrie Booksellers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is a Chief Inspector in the ever-shrinking Soctland Yard. They get cases that are for homeless and non-corporate people. They are funded through a dwindling tax base since the corps can find ways around them. There are exceptions, ITC still pays its fair share, for example. Diane is ground down, hard, bitter, but still trying to make a difference.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Recently Garrett Cavanaugh has brought her information on a rising number of mutilated homeless people throughout London. In all cases various body parts have been harvested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Diane is divorced as of six years ago. Her husband left her when she refused to leave the yard and apply for a corporate position. He wanted the prestige and perks of corp life, while she did not. He wanted to be a home husband with at least two kids and a wife with a steady, predictable hours job. Diane does not want children and doesn't want to only help mega-corp attached people.</p>
