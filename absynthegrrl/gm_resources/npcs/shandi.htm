<p class="pagecaption">Shandi ni Kayara</p>
<p class="regtxt5">arcane, fighter</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Description: 5’6" tall and skinny as a rail, her skin has a very faint purplish blue tone to it until she flexes her muscles. Then there is a definite purplish cast to her skin. The muscles pop out in sharp relief and their patterns don't look quite right either. Her eyes are an intense violet and tend to look unfocused unless she is wired up. Then they look very intense. Her hair is dark brown with dark purple high lights that show in full spectrum light and sunlight. Her movements are graceful and predatory.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Personality tags: vacant, spacey, fast, dangerous - mute, communicates better with sign language</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ideas: abduction, life while cursed, as dancer and priestess</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Personality: Shandi: enthusiastic but sheltered. She inherited her mom's ability to See although she never told her</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Personality: Crazy Girl: airhead, ditz, can't read or write, can't think logically, scared of arcane and techno things. She remains sleepy unless stimulated by her surroundings or body chemistry modifiers.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Abilities: deadly with shuriken and martial arts, can see magic as patterns of energy, when cured learned to use spells by creating patterns, very good dancer, priestess of Cult of the Sister, while demon is bound in her she has very high magic resistance, the alien parasites also confer a high resistance so she will remain fairly well protected even after the demon is removed</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Weapon: <a href="..\items\bracers.htm">Snake Bracers</a> Weapon: <a href="..\items\stars.htm">Throwing Stars</a> Item: <a href="..\items\shandi_anklet.htm">Anklet</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Details:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She is the daughter of <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> and <a href="sharyl.htm">Sharyl</a> through genetic manipulation by <a href="sharyl.htm">Sharyl</a>. <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> and <a href="sharyl.htm">Sharyl</a> have allowed <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> to believe he is her father to bolster his ego. Shandi does not yet know, although she had some suspicions before she ran. <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> will tell her when she returns with the Hut, assuming that they do.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Family was charged with her education and they tutored her along with <a href="ayl_kull.htm">Aalynn</a> - teaching her all the stuff they had found during their adventures. They were not allowed to send her on protected missions like <a href="ayl_kull.htm">Aalynn</a> went on though. She learned dance from her mother <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> and some tech stuff from <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a>, although she wasn’t really drawn to it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When she reached 18 she ran. Hoping to find adventure she hopped a tube train and headed in a random direction. She ended up in <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a>'s garden in Coslembra.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> implanted something and had a demon bound to it. He then used his brain scanner to load fear and distrust of anything requiring technology or magic. He also placed hard blocks against her abilities to think coherently. He blended her genetic structure with that of several demons and the creatures from Level Seven to make her a hybrid. It was his intent that this would give her the strength, speed, instincts, and reactions necessary to keep her alive. He wanted her father to have to deal with a situation he most likely could not fix without killing his own daughter. He implanted a small messaging device that was set to emerge and display a <a href="misc_data/aztol_msg.htm">holograph</a> of himself delivering a message to her father about Shandi.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="ishra.htm">Ishra</a> managed to slide enough of her conciousness into Shandi during the brainscan to act as a goad. This keeps reminding Shandi that <a href="ishra.htm">Ishra</a> is bound and needs to be freed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">All the tampering has left her in a state of almost stupor unless she is receiving doses of stimulants or in a situation of intense danger. She has a physical craving for either of the above. She is only able to really sleep after a dose or two of some of the stronger opium derivatives. Her favorite is laudanum like tinctures or a small pipe full of opium. Turkish coffee is about the weakest stimulant that will work for her. She will consume massive quantities of this during the average day. It is extremely rare to find her without a mug of the stuff at hand. If she really needs to be awake she will chew coca leaves or sometimes inject raw adrenaline. She doesn’t do this very often because of the availability of it. If she goes more than a few weeks without stimulants her body starts to consume itself. This is another legacy of <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">If attacked or in battle she tends to be very Callisto like, with a happy grin and pure madness present in her eyes. She tends to say things like, "You hurt me, why did you hurt me?" or, "How dare you try and hurt me..." as she is rapidly dealing with the attack. Several of the groups she’s been with don’t know which is worse, watching her take apart her opponents, or the absolute joy she seems to take in it. When the battle is over they have to deal with a very morose, depressed person who slides rapidly back into a kind of stupor. Most have found the best way to help her is to let her slip back into it and stay there for at least an hour or two before attempting to awaken her. Unlike Callisto she doesn’t have the same sort of vicious cruelty or revenge motivation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her speech patterns tend to be broken and jerky, as if it is somewhat difficult to string words together into a coherent whole. When she tries to formulate thought strings there are still residuals that work to scatter her thoughts around into incoherence. When <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> and <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> teach her signing she is able to communicate more clearly. It is less broken and jerky, although complex thoughts are still difficult. The signing is a mix of <a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">Eritsani</a> and <a href="../valen_inx.htm">Imperial</a> common forms from the times of <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> enlisted the aid of <a href="kaltereth.htm">Kaltereth</a> who was in his employ to set up the magical components of his effects on her mind. <a href="kaltereth.htm">Kaltereth</a> slipped Shandi out to Vilyanu just before she escaped herself. She wanted to place Shandi somewhere where <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> would not be likely to find her. <a href="kaltereth.htm">Kaltereth</a> escaped from him shortly after he cemented his hold over Ishra and the spider ship.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In Vilyanu Shandi was befriended by a group of adventurers new to the city. During their adventures they attempted to remove her curse. They were partially successful, unlocking her ability to see majik patterns and a little of her ability to communicate. They freed the demon that was holding the blocks in place, but they could not find a way to remove the blocks that wouldn't either kill her or render her catatonic.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She was gated to Marwatt's Reach during a magical fire-fight. The rest of the party is still wondering where she went. Here she met <a href="kyira.htm">Kyira</a> and became a part of <a href="ghostwind.htm">Ghost Wind</a>'s crew. They ended up on <a href="riverwind.htm">River Wind</a> and then in the <a href="../../hut_valen/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> has connected with her in strange ways and it has helped her remain more awake. Their relationship also gives her a bit more focus. She is learning to apply the ability to see majik. She could well become a formidable pattern based mage. The linking between the items they each own has been enhanced by the effects of both of their personalities. Together they will be able to See in new and clearer ways.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tag Lines:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"bored now", "Party time" or "This part not fun", "Play now"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* she remembers this about the implanting of the demon - it is one of the few nightmares she has */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I remember his laughter as it ate into her/my head. The pain, even now it burns where the demon chewed its way into my being. His laughter rose as I screamed. Over and over he chanted, "Now I have you, you arrogant bastard. Now I’ll squeeze your nuts till they pop!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A great Shandi concept:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"When you're facing down multiple attackers, you always want to make the first move. It lets them know that you're ready to fight and that you're crazy enough to get the party started. One rule of thumb in fighting is that crazy can often overcome skill and numbers, because, while a trained fighter might actually enjoy going up against another trained fighter, no one really wants to wrestle with crazy. Crazy doesn't know when it's winning. And crazy doesn't know when to stop. If you can't pull off crazy, if, for instance, you're handcuffed in a small van with six armed assailants, stupid is a decent substitute for crazy."<br/>
