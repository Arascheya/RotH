<p class="pagecaption">Shardra</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One of the most bloody of all pirates/brigands in Arduinian history is Shardra the Castrator with her band of bloody Amazons. She is known to be the third daughter of the trading house Gehl-Mokkonos of the Misty Isles, but little is known about her until her 14th year when her mother's free trade ship, Blue Falconess, was taken by the pirate Black Nose after a two day running fight in the Rainbow Sea.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shardra like most Amazon girls was adept with weapons, and she lent fast and accurate bow fire to the defense of the doomed ship. Knocked unconscious during the boarding, she awoke to find herself the sole survivor of her entire family. (This voyage had been the yearly pilgrimage customarily taken by her house to their ancestral home.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For the next two months she was in a drugged stupor, cruelly used by all the foul and depraved crew. Her mind snapped under the perverted usage of her body. It snapped, but not the way most would; no, her mind became cold and emotionless and her willpower secretly broke the hold the drugs had on her. For another four months she waited and plotted, enduring the nastiness heaped upon her by her captors. Then, less than a week before her 15th birthday, she acted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On a black and moonless hour of the night, she picked the lock on her ankle chain and took the curved knife she had stolen from the galley-cook and began her cat-like stalk through the ship. As dawn broke redly in the sky, the early sea gate watch relief noticed something strange about the corsair ship Nell Puppy. As the dawn's light broke over the ship, rivulets of blood could be seen flowing from the scuppers and spattering into the water. Raising the alarm, the guardsmen rushed aboard the ship and ran smack into a scene of horror and carnage. Every single member of the ship's crew had been slashed from ear to ear and had been castrated! 49 men had died not knowing what it was that had killed them. Of Shardra there was no sign, and she would disappear from the ken of men for three years.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When she reappeared it was in a welter of bloodshed and fire, as her and her screamingAmazon crew reaped a bloody harvest from one end of the Rainbow Sea to the other. No one knows where she went those three years, but when she returned she already had a ship and a crew.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Since that time she has become one of the most feared and hated people in the world. Whenever it is to hot for her and her ship, The Blood Maiden, to be a-sea, she docked it at her secret hideaway and became a brigand, ravaging afar across all the known continents. There are enough combined bounties out against her and her crew that if a single person was to collect them all, he/she would be rich for life.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aside from her ferocity in combat, she is a known Psychic and an Illusionist of a lesser sort. She is adept at disguise and poison making and is said to know the Runes of Lahkormahrra, the one and only known incantation that will open a World Gate to places not listed on any of the maps of worlds of the Multiverse. Now at the age of 30, she seemed like a ghost, uncatchable and unstoppable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">That is until the past couple of months. It seems that she and her bloody band had once again decided to pillage their way through Arduin in search of more treasure and other things for her collection. The Melnibonean garrison that had been sent to Arduin to help quell the insurrection two years ago had apparently been waiting for just such a sortie.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Melnibonean ambush included even a full-sized flying battle barge, portable catapults and bolt throwers and seven war oliphaunts. The battle raged for only three minutes. In that time 67 of Shardra's band were slain and some 30 Melniboneans. Even the battle barge had taken two surprise hits from some sort of strange techno magik wielded by Shardra. But Shardra and her two closest friends, <a href="shareya.htm">Shareya</a> and <a href="lisette.htm">Lisette</a> had somehow managed to disappear. It was rumored she had spoken those strange runes and fled to an unknown universe. Yet others still claimed to have seen the trio borne away by some great dark-winged demon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">What actually happened beyond the short sharp fight will probably not be known until Shardra herself speaks of it. If in truth she is still alive and capable of speaking. Shardra the Castrator has once again fled from the ken of men, and there are many who fervently hope she never returns.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She arrived through the Level Seven World Gate and immediately faced the Horrors waiting there. Severely injured, she and her companions were patched back together by <a href="sharyl.htm">Stormy</a> and <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a>. Using magic and psychology they have restored some of her shattered mind. She still hates and fears men, however she can control the rage and fear enough to wait for attacks before responding. <a href="sharyl.htm">Stormy</a> gave her the custody of the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern of Dark Delights</a> as a place to operate from. She has direct access to the Gardens of Lazaar and the Crowded Sea, where she is known as <a href="ghunayya.htm">Ghunayya</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shardra has remained a pirate, giving the day to day control of the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern</a> to <a href="shareya.htm">Shareya</a>, one of her closest friends. <a href="shareya.htm">Shareya</a> is also the owner of the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_bbb.htm">Blood Bath and Beyond</a> franchise in the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="lisette.htm">Lisette</a>, her other closest friend, has taken over the Thieves Guild in the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>. The guild houses in several major Lotus Empire cities are connected with the entrances to the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern of Dark Delights</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Adventurers in the know will use the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern</a> as a short cut between the linked cities. The staff of the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern</a> will not reveal this. It is up to the adventurers to figure it out on their own. Also, the portals will only return an adventurer to the place or places they have already been.</p>
