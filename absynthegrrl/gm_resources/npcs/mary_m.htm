<p class="pagecaption">Mary Marwatt (Serazar)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary, <a href="steve_m.htm">Steve</a>, and <a href="iskandera.htm">Ara</a> have been inseperable since they were children. Together they have supported each other against the religious and backward culture of their home world. Mary married <a href="steve_m.htm">Steve</a> when she became pregnant, not because the three wanted it, but to ease some of the tensions with the rest of the town and surroundings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary is the one who forms the alliance with <a href="ishra.htm">Ishra</a> when opening <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a> and gains access to the spider related magic used to heal and support <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">Asylum</a> residents.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Serazar family has been ruinning smuggling on Plethar's Hope for several generations. They have several farm holdings, bought slowly from the proceeds, and designed to house newer generations of Serazars. Mary and Steve are living in one of these properties. It contains smuggling tunnels and storage chambers, being nearest the covert landing field and sheltered by the surrounding hills from direct sight of the village.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary's mother is the one who left with the captain of the smuggler ship after her husband died. She is also the one that made sure Ara and Mary were on anti-pregnancy drugs and that their supplies are kept current.</p>
