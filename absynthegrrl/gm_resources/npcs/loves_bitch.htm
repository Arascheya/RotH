<p class="pagecaption">Love's Bitch</p>
<p class="regtxt5">House band at the <a href="../places/eternia/devilscathouse.htm">Devil's Cathouse</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are 6 band members, <a href="nightshade.htm">Nightshade</a> (Margaux) on drums, <a href="belladonna.htm">Belladonna</a> (Juli) on keyboards, <a href="ennui.htm">Ennui</a> on bass and vocals, <a href="nausea.htm">Nausea</a> (Maggie) on lead guitar and vocals, <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> as stage dancer and lead and backing vocals, and <a href="merris.htm">Merris</a> on violin and vocals. Their sound is similar to a mix of The Cruxshadows, Evanescence, Within Temptation, and Abney Park.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The original line-up for Love's Bitch was <a href="nightshade.htm">Nightshade</a> on drums, <a href="belladonna.htm">Belladonna</a> on keyboards, <a href="ennui.htm">Ennui</a> on bass, <a href="nausea.htm">Nausea</a> on lead guitar and vocals, and <a href="lemort.htm">Le Mort</a> on lead vocals. <a href="lemort.htm">Le Mort</a> was killed in a dark force attack on a rescue mission. This is the mission <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a>, <a href="sammi.htm">Sammi</a>, and <a href="jemima.htm">Jemima</a> were sent to help. <a href="lemort.htm">Le Mort</a> always dressed as an elegant Vampire About Town when performing. He always argued for more seriousness when performing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Add descriptions - <a href="nightshade.htm">Nightshade</a> - <a href="../../common/club_images/ntshade_lb.jpg">faith clone</a> - wears <a href="../../common/club_images/ntshade2_lb.jpg">cat morph makeup</a>, pink wife beater, and black leather pants when performing, <a href="belladonna.htm">Belladonna</a> - <a href="../../common/club_images/bella_lb.jpg">cave-buffy</a> clone - wears <a href="misc_data/brides.htm">Bride of Frankenstein makeup</a> and a white wedding dress when performing, <a href="nausea.htm">Nausea</a> - <a href="../../common/club_images/nausea_lb.jpg">marla singer</a> clone - wears <a href="misc_data/brides.htm">Bride of Frankenstein makeup</a> and an <a href="../../common/club_images/nausea2_lb.png">old pink looking wedding dress</a> when performing, <a href="ennui.htm">Ennui</a> - herself - wears <a href="../../common/club_images/ennui_lb.jpg">Boogie Woman</a> costume with a blood red crop top under the torn tuxedo coat when performing, <a href="merris.htm">Merris</a> - as herself - wears death's head makeup and black hooded cloak when performing - once again assuming a guise of an angel of death.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="merris.htm">Merris</a> is the latest member of the band. She recruited herself after seeing a show with <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> after the band returned without <a href="lemort.htm">Le Mort</a>. There is a section in notes dealing with this scene as well as the updated open the band creates after <a href="merris.htm">Merris</a> and <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> start. <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> was added shortly after as the stage dancer and backing vocals. She had come with <a href="merris.htm">Merris</a> and the others saw her dancing along. <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> wears makeup and costuming similar to <a href="../../common/club_images/kali_lb.jpg">Sally</a> from Nightmare Before Christmas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On stage the three "brides" ham it up with each other constantly in psuedo-lesbian erotic movements and actions. <a href="lemort.htm">Le Mort</a> was always put off by this. <a href="merris.htm">Merris</a> rolls with it in her role as reaper. <a href="nightshade.htm">Nightshade</a> gets pulled in as well whenever someone goes back to where she is or when she comes forward with percussion that isn't her drum kit. The band is playful and having a good time. They don't take themselves seriously at all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Typical <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_lbopen.htm">Show Opening</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">There should be a rock-operatic feel to the cycle of songs written about the "Dead Girl Living". If the songs were performed back to back it would tell the story of a disfunctional couple, Doctor Fronkonstien and her lover. The lover commits a form of suicide because she feels like the doctor is too much into her own ego. The doctor calls her lover back and they try again. In the end, the lover leaves again and Fronkonstien needs to figure out how to move on. This cycle has been written primarily by <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> with assitance from the others.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> is the rawest singer in the band and tends to sing lead on the songs requiring the most intense and raw style. <a href="nausea.htm">Nausea</a> has a more lyrical and fluid singing style.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">will guest appear at Dans once they are a bit more established - this might work into a once a month gig</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris will weave the celtic and classical themes she knows into the threads of the rock styles of Love's Bitch</p>
