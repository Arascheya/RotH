<p class="pagecaption">Amorama</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lich, possesses the <a href="../items/ring_onemind.htm">Ring of Onemind</a>. Amorama started life as the fighter pilot that captured the Razak courier fleeing the homeworld with the <a href="../items/ring_onemind.htm">Ring of Onemind</a> just before the Zeltropian destruction force arrived. He died in the poison gas attack, however, the ring kept him functioning as a host for the Onemind Virus.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His resting place was in the sub-basements of the StratCom fighter facility located in the Hidden Valley. He remained undisturbed until the last Hell Gate War. Servants of <a href="thehand.htm">The Hand</a> found his resting place and opened it, searching for items. The viral payload infected them and began the conversion to the <a href="../gods/razaks.htm">Razak</a> Onemind. He used these minions to build a more elaborate place of power and began expanding his influence. The terrible battles of the Hell Gate Wars depleted his minions and drove him back into the depths of his holdings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He has begun to stir once more, taking over the villagers that used to supply <a href="margla.htm">Margla</a> and the <a href="../../hut_online/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a>. He has begun to move faster now that the <a href="../../hut_online/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a> has not been in evidence for quite some time. In recent months he has begun to assimilate merchanters from the caravans between the High Valley and the <a href="../places/val_exp/val_exp_inx.htm">Valley of Experiment</a>. He plans to send the assimilated merchanters back as soon as the conversion process is complete. This will be the seed troops for more assimilations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Use Castle Avernus from Ravenloft RQ3 (Raven_FromShadows) as the basis for the above ground sections of the complex. Mix in the fact the central tower was a remnant from the time of the Ancients, including a set of ship heavy weapons mounted on the lower tower roof. Use FlacTower22 image for the upper areas concept. <a href="../places/val_exp/amorama.htm">Location descriptions</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Onemind Virus won't work on the local people unless it is transmitted directly from the ring. Amorama is looking for someone with a ring of the ancients to gain access to the tube-trains. This will get him to the Gardens of Lazaar and the medical facilities there, where he hopes to modify the viral payload to make it directly infectious.</p>
