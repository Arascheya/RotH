<p class="pagecaption">Darien</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Darien has a gentlemanly cowboy approach in his demeanor. His language is filled with Howdy's and Ma'am and sir kind of things. This was an anachronism in the Inferno, but a very pleasant sort. Quiet and reserved, Darien doesn't say much about himself. He came from a broken home and the bad parts of town. Over time he pulled himself out and doesn't speak of it much at all. He had a sister who was badly abused and raped by his father's brother. No one believed her so she disappeared one night. She has never been found.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Darien is from <a href="ennui.htm">Ennui</a>'s Realm and was killed in one of the first attacks on Death City by the proxy gods.</p>
