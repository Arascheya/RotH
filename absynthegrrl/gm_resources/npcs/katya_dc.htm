<p class="pagecaption">Katya</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Appears in Death City stories after the current breaking of the Truce is resolved. Petrov and his team find her on a recovery world under wreckage, appearing less injured than her position and clothing would indicate. She becomes a bartender at the Devil's Cathouse, usually working the upper bar. She is a very good dancer, although she rarely dances with others around. She is quiet, shy, and does not remember anything before being rescued by Petrov.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Katya is eastern european looking and waifish, with an <a href="../../../tmp_images/DeathCityMisc/eye_horus/the-eye-of-horus.jpg">eye</a> <a href="../../../tmp_images/DeathCityMisc/eye_horus/Eye_of_Horus.jpg">of</a> <a href="../../../tmp_images/DeathCityMisc/eye_horus/backdrop-egypt-eye-of-horus.jpg">horus</a> tattoo over her left eye and 3 blood red tears below her right one.</p>

Katya has the same energy signature and way of moving as <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> but without the baggage of 35 years in the realms.</p>
