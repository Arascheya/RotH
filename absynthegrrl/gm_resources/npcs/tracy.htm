<p class="pagecaption">Tracy Welch</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tracy is an older woman, sort of Lindsey Crouse-ish in appearance. She was an archeologist, specializing in analysis of governemnt and social organizations. Kali was on the team sent to pick her up when a site caved in and crushed her. Even then she wasn't ready to leave because she was deep in the middle of figuring something out.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tracy is distracted and vacant most times. Her mind is off on some piece of the latest puzzle she is working on. She works with the historical group at the Hall of Records. Left to herself she tends to slide into isolation and withdrawl. She doesn't prefer to be alone, she's just too distracted to notice it. Kali helps keep her grounded and attached. Tracy also enjoys having someone to talk to about the day's activities and discoveries.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She keeps her sleeping area imaculate and sparse. She explains it as being from years of sleeping in small facilities at remote locations. Her work areas are a completely different affair. These tend to be vast scatters of papers, artifacts, drawings and images. She takes notes into a battered laptop attached to various peripherals for capturing digital data. The only item not showing extreme damage is her scanner.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali will equip her room with a net drop. Tracy will seperate it into a sleeping area and a work area with a set of large canvas curtains. This will give the bed area the feel of a desert tent. Tracy would have moved in a portable cot, however Kali insists on giving her a decent bed. She will grudgingly accept it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali will also give her the use of the computer in her office. She explains, "I wrote in the realms to escape my life. I am so involved in my life here that I no longer need that outlet. You need a better system and more space to spread out, so please, take over the office."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tracy likes taking part in the research sections of missions. She's not as fond of the actual rescue work. She will avoid the Extraction Teams, although Kali has taken her once in a while when she really needed Tracy's research abilities to solve a particular issue.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She arrives before Kali begins building Leopardess.</p>
