<p class="pagecaption">"The Author" - mystery woman</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This person appears as a <a href="../../common/npc_images/author.htm">non-descript</a> person, not memorable in any way. She is neither young, nor old. Her face is nondescript, not beautiful or ugly, or handsome, or plain. It is a face it would be very hard to pick out of a crowd. Her hair is a no color brown, worn long and straight and her eyes are washed out pale blue. She wears baggy clothing over a thin androgynous frame. She usually is typing into a battered laptop of a faded grey almost like it has been left in the sun too long. The only color on it comes from a gold mud flap girl sticker stuck to the back of the flip up screen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She lives in an abandoned warehouse near the tunnel up near the spillway from the upper town. She has spoken only once to Kali. To everyone else she appears mute, using a small white board to communicate when necessary. She helps out at various locations. She does dishes at the Adam and Eve sometimes, cleans brewing equipment at Audrey's brewery, roasts coffee at the coffee shop where Dementia takes Kali, and she is a cataloger at the rescued items sorting area. She figured out a roasting profile that worked with the Tezkyakla smoked beans. A rescue had brought back almost a thousand pounds of beans from a warehouse, only to find they had bee smoked by various woods when the fires ripped through that area.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="anastasia.htm">Anastasia</a> picked her up from a thriving world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The warehouse is based on the Scanlan-Morris building. She lives in the section closer to the road and in the front. The space she has claimed is about 30 by 50. There is a spiral stair up from the door in that section that continues to a roof hatch. She sometimes sits or stands on the roof to enjoy the weather. The door closest to the stairs up to her area is an ornate carved wooden one with tarot symbols on it - determine what type/feel. There is a wrought iron arbor over the gate in the fence nearest her door. it is covered with climbing roses. a rock path winds the short distance to the door through flower beds. the flowers are <a href="teresa.htm">Teresa</a>'s contribution.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ivy vines cover their section of the building and have invaded part of the windows, giving the light coming in a green cast and softening the edges.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She befriends <a href="teresa.htm">Teresa</a> after her arrival. She is the one that initiates IM as a way to get <a href="teresa.htm">Teresa</a> to start talking. Eventually she moves <a href="teresa.htm">Teresa</a> into a section of the warehouse, near hers, when <a href="teresa.htm">Teresa</a> begins to trust her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Concept to play with - Mystery Woman and <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> are linked in some strange way, almost like they came from the same point of origin</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* additional concepts */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rather than being electronics/programming, consider having her focus on chocolatier, coffee roasting, washing dishes at the Adam and Eve, and brewery cleanup at Death's Head Brewery. She could develop an elaborate coffee roasting device, steampunk in appearance, arcane in action, and a visual treat to the coffee shop patrons. She would own and operate Black Rose Chocolatier and Roasterie. Coffee bags are marked with a full-color black rose, chocolates are stamped with a rose line drawing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finds a replacement source of the smoked Tezkyakla coffe, which turns out to have been a <a href="../pharmacom/organics/kavla.htm">kavla</a> variant. The new source comes from <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a> in <a href="../places/planescape/centrys.htm">Sphere</a>.</p>
