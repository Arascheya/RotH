<p class="pagecaption">Sammi - R17 Character</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi is simply staggeringly gorgeous, long natural blonde hair (braided
or tied back when she's working on stuff or there's lots of wind (driving with the doors open, for instance), high, fine cheekbones, deep blue eyes.  She's just over 5', but with long legs and a shorter body.  Due to a fairly energetic lifestyle, she is "athletically built", she has muscles but not excessively so.  Her breasts are small but firm. The overall effect is of "competent femininity", she looks (and is)
smart, capable, competent, and just happens to also be most people's image of "attractive womanhood".</p>
<p class="regtxt5">One of the interesting things about them is that it's Jemima who thinks more like the aristocrat, while Sammi is mentally 100% engineer. This confuses and confounds people who don't know them, especially people who try to manipulate of take advantage of them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Individually they both tend to run into trouble, especially Sammi who still has a lot of issues from her past to deal with, but together they are totally unstoppable.</p>
