<p class="regtxt5">Steve was <a href="mary_m.htm">Mary</a> and <a href="iskandera.htm">Ara's</a> lover and the father of <a href="mary_m.htm">Mary's</a> children. He has been a constant companion in their lives since they were all in their early teens. They have provided a mostly unified front against the religious and backward culture of their home world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Steve married <a href="mary_m.htm">Mary</a> after finishing school and they inherited a farmstead from Mary's folks. <a href="iskandera.htm">Ara</a> moved in with them as soon as the farm was set up and has lived with them ever since. They have made their poly amorous, three way life style work and have been happy for most of their time together.</p>
