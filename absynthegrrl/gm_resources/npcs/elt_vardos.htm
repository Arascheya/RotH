<p class="regtxt5">Son of Atrayas Vardos of the <a href="../info/talons.htm">Talons</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Elentaryn was placed on <a href="../places/karanal/karanaldata.htm">Karanal</a> by <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> as part of a favor she owed Altrayas, she knows him as brilliant, but lacking in many social graces. He is one of the more polite scientific people she has had to deal with though and there is some grudging respect both ways. He tends to see <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> as a capable administrator, but way too ruthless to be really trusted.</p>
