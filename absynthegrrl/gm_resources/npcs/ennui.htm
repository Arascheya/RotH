<p class="pagecaption">Ennui - Anna-Elisa Marie Thomas</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui is 5'5" and very pale with dark green eyes and light brown hair, when it isn't colored some outragious color. She works at the <a href="../places/eternia/devilscathouse.htm">Devil's Cathouse</a> and handles the secondary bar on the dance floor. She oversees a small army of servers that prowl the floor. She is also the bass player for <a href="loves_bitch.htm">Love's Bitch</a>. Need to establish that she noodled around in high school but really got into it once she left for university. She is picked up during her third year. She likes coffee overly sweet either with plenty of sugar or plenty of sweetened condensed milk.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui is one of <a href="erick.htm">Erick</a>'s few true friends. He turns to her for advice and when he needs to talk. Ennui was basically straight when she arrived. <a href="dimentia.htm">Dementia</a> is one of the few women she finds attractive. Currently they have a very strange relationship based on love and mutual need to keep nightmares from overwhelming them both. If Ennui and <a href="dimentia.htm">Dementia</a> attempt to sleep more than a few feet apart they are both assailed by terrible nightmares.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui is also a <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_shadow.htm">Shadow Walker</a>, although she keeps very quiet about it. She will volunteer to work on <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a>'s <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_org_chart.htm">Extraction Teams</a> and will prove to be very good at it. She will function as team lead when more than one team is required for a mission.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui lives in a flat above the <a href="../places/eternia/devilscathouse.htm">Devil's Cathouse</a>. She has the smaller of the two tower suites. She has it decorated in classic goth, velvets, dark colors, fancy wrought ironwork and the like. She prefers heavy furniture and darker items with splashes of color for accents. She likes to let the light in though, so her window coverings tend to be laces and sheers.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui was born with the circus. She and her mom travelled with the show until she was twelve. At that time her mom married a sedentary man in the midwest and the settled down there. Ennui misses the travel and the life with the circus. The town she lived in until she went off to school was small and stifling. Few would even travel to the circus when it was nearby. For a while she could talk her mom into the trip, but it got harder and harder as her mom slowly absorbed the views of the world around her. It sort of figured though, her mom had run away from a town that was very similar to join the circus rather than go to university. Ennui has no idea who her real father was and couldn't care less. Her mom however has grown more and more guilt ridden about the affair that brought Ennui to life. Ennui started life named Anna-Elisa Marie Thomas after a performer her mom admired. She changed her name to Ennui to spite the poeple in school who began taunting the new kid. They called her that as an insult and she ran with it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">While in the gaje town she got her first tattoo at thirteen. She became friends with the daughter of the tattooist at Brewhouse Designs and got it as a dare from her friend. Brewhouse Designs is in the old South Bend Brewing Association brewery building.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Images for the <a href="../places/eternia/devilscathouse.htm">Devil's Cathouse</a> are from the South Bend Brewing Association building. Brief history of the brewery:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In June of 1903 a group of South Bend saloon keepers of German, Polish and Hungarian descent organized the South Bend Brewing Association to manufacture and sell beer.  Their building, of Medieval castellated design, was completed in 1905.  Its four story facade with corner towers and tiers of lower height in the rear reflect the necessities of brewing beer.  Height was needed for processes that were based on gravity flow, assisted by pumping and hoisting.  The horizontal extensions towards the rear of the building contained power, heating and refrigeration equipment and loading facilities.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">During Prohibition the company’s name was changed to South Bend Beverage and Ice Association to reflect the change of products to non-alcoholic drinks such as Hoosier Cream Soda and the production of ice.  In 1922 George Voedisch, a 25 year veteran from Muessel’s Brewery, became president and general manager, and the Voedisch family remained in control until the brewery closed in 1950.  After Prohibition, 50,000 barrels of beer were produced yearly, serving northern Indiana and southern Michigan; by 1950 production was down to 25,000 barrels a year.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While she was with the circus she was educated by various members of the troup under a quasi-home schooling approach. Included were circus related topics. Once settled in among the 'mundanes' she used them to excel in some of the school's athletic pursuits, however she never really was accepted anyway. She was too 'rough' and didn't show the proper respect for the way things were done. She particularly hated gender specific restrictions on which classes she could take. Her mom was no help either, refusing to back her when she asked for assistance.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Worked at the Sunrise Cafe during summers to pay for college.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At university she is supposed to be studying to be a nurse, heaven forbid she should aspire to doctor. Instead she is taking theater. When her parents find out there will be a hell of a row.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">consider South Bend Indiana and surroundings as her home</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui likes her coffee heavily sugared, she also likes turkish style now and again, or sweetened condensed milk in it. She also likes rich, dry red wines and <a href="../pharmacom/drinks/toxicwaste.htm">Toxic Waste</a>.</p>
