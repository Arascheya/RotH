<p class="regtxt5">Irena Katarya is the incarnation of <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> that appears in the Realms of the Hut gaming Realms. She is the incarnation of the Balance Keeper, one of the three <a href="../gods/younger_gods.htm">Greater Powers</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In this version need to determine how the Ghost Wind/Hut situation is set up - does the Ghost Wind crew have contact with the Hut crew? If so, is this why they are sending players looking for it?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One of her lines is: "You do not beg the void for mercy.", an Eritsani line she adopted from Kara. Her other common line is, "The universe is indifferent, so am I."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sha'Nyakla Enlyolshe - literally, Great Balance Sister - Balance Keeper in the elder tongues. This has devolved into many variants, some closer, some farther from the original. While this is an old label for the third Power, it is still not a controlling name. The three Sisters have names they use among themselves, but even those are not binding. Since they existed before names, they are immune to that form of control.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The old tongue refered to the three Powers as the Three Sisters, the Order Sister, the Chaos Sister, and the Balance Sister</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Cult of the Balance has grown up in various forms throughout the history of the multi-verse. In the current incarnation on of their sayings is "Great Balance, Sha'Nyala, a derivitive of the name of the Keeper.</p>
