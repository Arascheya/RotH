<p class="pagecaption">Sophia Nelson</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sophia is 25, works as a designer for a game company, and she is an avid FRP player, mostly as game master. Recently she has been moved into character development based on skills she exhibited when working on a new online offering. She and <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa Finley</a> work for the same company. They both knew <a href="jsolitaire.htm">Jaime Solitaire</a> when they were all at university together. <a href="jsolitaire.htm">Jaime</a> was an avid gamer, with a wealth of world and character designs. She was also a bit of a writer. Sophia and <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a> lost track of her when she joined the ranks of the Rani Group. Sophia disappeared shortly after <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a> was disappearing more and more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two of her favorite charcaters are <a href="allyssa_t.htm">Alyssa Tomarasdan-Feyid</a> and <a href="laura_s.htm">Laura Sannall</a>. They started in another game and were updated to be NPCs in Sophia's campaign.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was the character dev lead on a new offering from the company. This was to be called the Realms of the Hut which was based on design concepts mainly from <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissa</a> and her. The PC, named <a href="nadya_a.htm">Nadya Ayrthane</a> for the Keeper stories, also appears in the world where Sophia lands. <a href="nadya_a.htm">Nadya</a> has just finished the 'Afterwards' portion of the online adventure concept.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia is a goth girl wannabe. She sort of dresses the part at work and when she goes out, but she is too shy to actually hook up with the scene.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia will slowly remember that Jaime had created an elaborate world with many of the elements she will encounter as a member of the Hut.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her family disowned her during her senior year in high school. She went to college on various scholarships and by working for the university. She hasn't told anyone the details of what happened. The closest she has come has been in talking with <a href="uru_irena.htm">Irena</a> at Waverly's.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia has a tramp stamp of the chest tattoo Nyis, Jaime, and Irena have.</p>
