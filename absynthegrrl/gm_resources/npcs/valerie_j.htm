<p class="pagecaption">Valarie Jason</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="irendi_w.htm">Irendi</a>'s lover and partner</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valarie - will not allow herself to be a 'kept' woman, feels she MUST contribute monetarily into any partnered living situation, is heterophobic from many bad experiences when younger</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She doesn't trust power structures or men in general, she was raped when she was 16 by a 29 year old cousin. She had trusted him and had told him she thought she might be lesbian. He then forced himself on her, telling her all she needed was the right man.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">No one believed her as he was a rising star in the family business and a respected leader in several community groups. She even tried reporting the incident through channels at her school but nothing came of them. He came after her again and she went for him with a knife. Her family believed him and threw her out. She lived in teen shelters and with friends until she managed to get a job at the apartment complex. At first it was cleaning work, but she was aggressive enough to work her way up. She survived by not trusting anyone.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">
Her parents were emotionally distant and expected perfect performance from her and her sister. Nothing was good enough for them. From little onward they were taught to always be aware that everyone was watching them and that 'people won't like you' if you do things your way instead of theirs. Her father was ex military and treated her and her sister as cadets for the first ten years of life. She has a very deep resentment toward that kind of approach to anything. She will go ballistic at the mere mention of a 'need to know' situation. Her sister is emotionally dead, she goes through the motions of being a housewife and mother but the spark that used to be there is gone. Valarie finds out that her sister went through something similar to her but from younger and for far longer. One of her goals once she becomes part of Rani Corp. is to find all she can on her cousin and destroy him.</p>
