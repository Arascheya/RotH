<p class="pagecaption">Rachel Stevens</p>
<p class="regtxt5">b. 11 January 1935, d. 4 June 1955</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Daughter of Henrietta Mansen and Thomas Stevens. She died young from complications of being pregnant without being married. The family buried her away from the main family plots out of shame.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rachel's grave is where <a href="ennui.htm">Ennui</a> often ended up when things were bad at home. Is her shade one of the watchers that brought <a href="ennui.htm">Ennui</a> to Death City's attention? If so, then she has talked to <a href="dimentia.htm">Dementia</a> about her before <a href="dimentia.htm">Dementia</a> was sent to pick up <a href="ennui.htm">Ennui</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Even though she was buried in disgrace, someone cared enough to erect a stone angel over her grave and a raise tomb for her casket. Hers is still the poorest and least ornate of the Mansen/Stevens graves, however.</p>
