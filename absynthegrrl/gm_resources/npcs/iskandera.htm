<p class="pagecaption">Arascheya ni Iskandera</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aliases: Ara Hadresson, Ara Serazar, Arascheya Iskandera</p>

<p class="regtxt5">prelim data - where the actual story differs, the story is canon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was an early Arcane, one of the first from Skelos to come to Zeltrop and beyond. During her Gate hopping she was leading a party of adventurers seeking a place called Caliban. They emerged in the Hull Metal fabrication site during their transit. Later in her travels she came upon the dead <a href="../places/drkzyrkth.htm">home world</a> of the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By this time she was down to four companions. These four were the most rethluess and capable of survival. While on the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a> <a href="../places/drkzyrkth.htm">world</a> they killed Iskandera because she would not let them loot. Her blood came into contact with dormant <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyrites</a> and she was reborn. In hunger and rage she consumed her companions, leaving them bloodless and dead on the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a> <a href="../places/drkzyrkth.htm">world</a>. Thus she became the mythic Grandmother of the <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">Vampyr</a> and the 0 Vector for the infection.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She found <a href="../items/talis_anubis.htm">Mereret's Necklace</a> on the same world. However she found it too late to reverse the insanity she suffed from the hunger and the brain trauma inflicted by her companions when they killed her. The necklace allowed her to live long enough to find the anklet and to re-open the gate to take her to a living world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a time she continued her Gate hopping, driven by curiosity and the driving need to pass on the <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyrites</a> and feed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her travels eventually led her to the ancient Egypt-like time of <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a>'s homeworld. She turned <a href="angelique.htm">Mereret</a> and various others. She would have continued but <a href="angelique.htm">Mereret</a> killed her after she had turned eleven others. Those in turn began turning still more. <a href="angelique.htm">Mereret</a> and <a href="imhotep.htm">Imhotep</a> took care of quite a few of these, however enough had moved on for the <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyrites</a> to continue to spread.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was the youngest in the family, born to her mother, Iskandera, just before they came to the colony world. Her older sister was a genetic throwback, manifesting as human instead of hybrid. Her mother is a <a href="../monsters/demons/demon_succubus.htm">succubus</a>, her father a planar who fell in love with her. Her mother had a domain in the Discord which was covetted by others of her type. Her slip into neutrality/good gave them the opportunity to destroy her legions and assault her holdings. Rather than perish, she fled with her planar lover to the one-dim realm of the colony. They established themselves as Anna and Paul Hadresson. Arascheya would be considered an <a href="../monsters/demons/demon_alu_fiend.htm">Alu-Fiend</a>(Planescape) in terms of abilities, if she knew how to access them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her mother implanted a small charm at the base of her neck which locks her in human form, rather than the demonic form she would normally default to. Her mother had originally planned to tell Iska about her heritage and the charm when she was in her late teens however the family was turned in to the church and everyone was burned except for Ara when she was four. Her older sister Iris had turned in the family, disgusted by her demonic parents and fearing for the soul of her younger sister.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anna Hadresson left a diary with Ara when the fire was started. Ara was adopted by the Serazar family and grew up with Mary Serazar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ara's mother, Anna Hadresson, started life named Iskandera. She was a powerful succubus who had carved out a small domain in the Sphere of Concordant Discord as well as her holdings in the Abyss. Others sought to overthrow her and take the domain for themselves. They conspired to ambush and kill her, however, she was warned and fled. She took with her a box containing the artifact that allowed her to create and hold the pocket domain in <a href="../places/planescape/plains.htm">The Discord</a>. As a result, the take-over failed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Most of her life she has felt like there is some type of pressure, pushing against a block in her mind. This was worst when she would get angery. Her mother and father worked hard at teaching her to manage anger, rather than letting it build and reach overwhelming levels. Removing the charm allows this energy to burst free. The ability to shape shift comes with it, however, extreme anger will cause her to revert to her true form. As she gains some control, the angry form can manifest without the wings of her kind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She removed the charm once she figured out it was there and placed it in a ring setting, so she can still use it, but remove it when she wants to directly determine her appearance. She uses the demonic form when interacting with her targets.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As a <a href="../monsters/demons/tanar_ri.htm">Tanar'ri</a> she has certain inate powers, once the amulet is out of her neck. These are: telepathy that lets them communicate with any intelligent life form regardless of language barriers, darkness, 15‘ radius, infravision, and teleport without error, charm person, dimension door (once per day), ESP, shape change (to a humanoid form of approximately their own height and weight only), and suggestion. See the <a href="../monsters/demons/tanar_ri.htm">Tanar'ri</a> write-up for which attack forms will actually damage her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Arascheya founded the Asylum with her lovers and their children. She is also responsible for the establishment of the Arascheyann Dynasty on the 666th layer of the Abyss. This dynasty is the source of the Daughters of Arascheya, the guardians of the Gates of the multi-verse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Arascehya was last seen heading off to find the Drkzyrkth Home World with a small band. She died there and was reborn as the zero vector for the vampyrites. Mary and Steve never learned what happened to their lover.</p>
