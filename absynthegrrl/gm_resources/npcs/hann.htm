<p class="pagecaption">Hann the Builder (Artificer of the Gods)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hann started life as a regular arcane. As he grew in power and ability he sought the legendary Gardens of Lazaar, where he grew in ability to be a master constructor of items and equipment. Circumstances (to be defined) elevated him to god-hood and landed him a place in the Sphere of Concordant Discord. Now he constructs major and minor artifacts and extremely powerful items for those with enormous wealth. He takes on apprentices, petitioners, from Centrys and the Plains based on ability and perseverance.</p>
