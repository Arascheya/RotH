<p class="pagecaption">Edward Stark</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Edward Stark is a prominent local businessman and <a href="felicity_anders.htm">Felicity</a>'s love interest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He has an older sister, Charlotte "Shar" Stark, who is the President of the Museum of Natural History in Yew Nork.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Edward's personality is amix of sensible businessman and Robert Downey's Tony Stark. It's this boyish charm that Felicity responds to.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stark is a dabbler. His family made its money through theatres and hotels during the 1800's and early 1900's. He maintains the small empire from this time, however his first love is fiddling with technology. He releases plans for a simple muscle controlled interface to the web as an open source project. He has published several white-papers on networking and data condensing that caught the attention of Rani Corp.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* use Tony Stark as image reference and personality reference for Edward and Char for image reference for Shar */</p>
