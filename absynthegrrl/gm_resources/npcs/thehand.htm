<p class="pagecaption">The Hand</p>
<p class="regtxt5">No one knows the name of this being any more. He was an arcane who stumbled across the <a href="../items/handofdestructor.htm">Hand of Azeloth</a> the physical remains of the first high priest of Etesa, the Destructor. When the Hand picked up this item it grafted itself to him and he absorbed the powers of Azeloth. This happened deep in the Galhai Wastes, near Accursed Akhalt. As yet no one knows where the <a href="../items/eye_destruct.htm">Eye of Azeloth</a> is.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He has access to various troops from the dragonlance stuff</p>
<p class="regtxt5">His physical form can only be damaged by magic weapons of +4 or greater. Techno weapons will inflict damage at one quarter of total amounts. The Sword of Lorsan will dispel his physical form and force him to return to his home base. It will take 5 days for his physical self to reform. To destroy him requires the destruction of the Hand of Azeloth, using the bowl of purity. The Hand of Azeloth will be found in the depths of his fortress when he is regenerating his physical form.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Hand’s fortress is deep within the bowels of Akhalt. Consider using the Sea of Dust city as the upper sections of this...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">WHERE ENCOUNTERED: Any place he has conquered or intends to conquer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">SPECIAL ABILITIES: See below.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sorcerers, scholars, military strategists, and worried townsfolk have speculated on the true nature of the Black Prince for decades uncounted. Only two things are certain: his lust for power is only equaled by his skill in amassing, it, and apparently he cannot be killed -- not for long, anyway.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">While his magical skills are not as precise and diverse as, say, the Lord of Chaos, the Prince is unexcelled at the binding of War Demons. (His battle-axe is, in fact, a small demon bound into the shape of an axe, and endowed with the power to fly from the Prince's hand and fight as if the Prince still held it. The demon, needless to say, is not thrilled with this servitude.) A perfect example of his skill, power, and confidence in this area is his chariot, which is composed of the fleshy forms of three balrogs.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Prince ' s greatest asset is his spiritual detachment from his body: through ancient pacts with dark powers, the Prince's very life-force is bound into the wails of his mountain stronghold. Thus. if his body is slain, the Prince can easily resurrect himself. It is believed that the only way he can be permanently killed is to destroy the castle, brick .. by brick -- and it is unlikely that the Prince woul5 stand by idly and watch it happen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">THE  BLACK  PRINCE'S  CHARIOT</p>
<p class="regtxt5">WHERE ENCOUNTERED: Anyplace the Prince has conquered or intends to conquer.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">NUMBER ENCOUNTERED: I (unique)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">HIT POINTS: 2D6+28 per Balrog </p>
<p class="regtxt5">ARMOR: Hide as plate-and-chain +3</p>

<p class="regtxt5">SPECIAL ABILITIES: Each demon can project a flame-bolt, inflicting damage equal to that demon ' s current hit points, once every five melee rounds.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The last time the Black Prince was slain, the denizens of the nether planes sought to keep him forever. Would that it was that easy to do so! The Black Prince roams the world again -- riding a chariot created with the extremely unwilling aid of Pahadron, Malach-Ra and Azaradel, his servitors balrogs. Except for the pentagram in which the Prince stands, the entire chariot is formed from the balrogs ' flesh and flame. In this form, they can bear the Prince to any point in the known world before the next dawn.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">However, the Prince has been known to unleash the balrogs as shock troops (thus, the combat statistics above). They relish these opportunities to vent their frustration on hapless humans, while also regretting that they cannot join those humans against their true enemy, their lord and master - the Black Prince. --Tom Smith.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Hand seeks <a href="../items/souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a> to re-open the last four <a href="../info/gateinfo.htm">Hell Gates</a>, or to finally close the one in the Labyrinth so he can open new ones in locations he can control. He has the Guardians looking for it since they can sense it.</p>
