<p class="regtxt5">First Elder.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He is a middle age appearing man with intense cat green eyes and a scar across the left side of his face.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He is no longer quite sane. The years of trying to mold the current populace of the world into his ideal of the Zeltropian Golden Age has worn away at him. He cannot grasp that it won't ever work.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Recently he has found out <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> was not his daughter. He had been running a genetic simulation on some of her left behind DNA to see what she would look like this long after her disappearance. When he was checking the results he discovered she is a mix of <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a>'s and <a href="sharyl.htm">Sharyl</a>'s DNA.</p>
