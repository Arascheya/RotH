<p class="pagecaption">Angie</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She'd been considered a joke at her old workplace. A geeky woman who baked her own bread, made her own soap and was a walking repository of what her co workers considered to be useless information. They'd made fun of her, and considered her to be a nutcase obsessive without a clue. She sometimes took comfort in the fact that she was abrasive enough that she kept the worst of the idiot skirt chasers scared enough to leave her alone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fourteen years after the dollar store she has a large family from her foundlings, and others that have arrived since.</p>
