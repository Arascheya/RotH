<p class="pagecaption">Le Mort - Danny Cleveland</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Danny struts, preens, and belts out vocals well but only in a narrow range of style. He begins to frustrate the rest of the band after a fairly short time since he can't move much beyond what they first start as musically. His personal style is classic vampire goth.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Danny is also uncomfortable with the lesbian-like play and harrasment the female members of the band engage in. He feels slighted that none of them are interested in him. Never quite realizing it is because he seems really shallow and vain to them.</p>
