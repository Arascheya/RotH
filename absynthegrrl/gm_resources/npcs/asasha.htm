<p class="pagecaption">Asasha Pivovarova</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is the 8th member of the Rani Corp core group. She answers to Vashi in the org charts, but this is on paper only. She has direct input to the Crones Council, but has requested to not be considered a voting member.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Determine her reasons for this as dev goes on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her expertise is in web and online venues. She has an advanced degree in marketing, however, like Vashi, she considers her education to be mostly crap. She has thrown out the BS and kept only the things that conform to Rani Corp and her personal ethics.</p>
