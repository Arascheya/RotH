<p class="regtxt5">Tansy was born n a small village on a world where mon-theism was on the rise. Her village had already been assimilated into this model. There were whispered rumors of isolated villages that still practiced the old pagan ways, but they were being found and saved by the brave priests of the true god.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tansy came from a poor family, who did not have lands assigned to them. Her father labored when he could and stole when he could not. He had been caught and his left hand had been cut off when Tansy was five. Everyone in the family had been taught to steal and they were expected to do so when told.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When she turns seventeen, she is sold to a passing slaver for a pittence. Father decided he needed the money more than a daughter. She was cruelly used by the slavers and, instead of breaking, went cold and dangerous. She escapes, freeing <a href="ghunayya.htm">Ghunayya</a>, and killing the slaver band. They set out to free other disadvantaged women and kill as many priests and nobles as possible.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mad Meg, the village herbalist, was teaching her the secrets of herbalism when she was sold. After her escape, she returns to the village to enact revenge on her father, however, love of her mother stops her. She ends up freeing Mad Meg from Father Oswald, the village priest, who is going to burn Meg for heresy. Oswald is killed by Nayya and nailed to the cross of his dead god.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tansy and <a href="thalasa.htm">Thalasa</a> become <a href="../info/sisters_web.htm">Sisters of the Web</a>, initiated by <a href="ishra.htm">Ishra</a>, when the priests and nobles seriously threatened their survival.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she was trained in herbalism by Mad Meg as she was growing up. The miller's daughter, Gwedlyn, was the other student. */</p>
