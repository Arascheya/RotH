<p class="pagecaption">Prince Sergei Dracul</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Born Vlad Tepes - now <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Prince Sergei Dracul - takes place of Vlad Dracula/Strahd - uses a brother's name to avoid recognition by western leaders. this is an alternate earth, so make him actually a hero of the Wallachian/Moldavian/Transylvanian people - he is killed by the turks after his wife is tricked into suicide. As vampyr he is working under existing politics to undo the reigns of terror inflicted after Stephen and his deaths. He is a member of the <a href="../info/prague_cabal.htm">Prague Cabal</a> He seeks the re-incarnated soul of his lost love as well - residing in <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina Murray</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">An old gypsy seer told him he would meet his love once more in a great city to the west. This inspired his move to London. Stoker has him mixed in with vampyrs already living in London. These are decendantsof a "master" vampyr from the depths of the Caucasus mountains. It is not known whether this "master" vampyr is Vlad or someone else.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sergei meets <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a> when she is about in the city. He strikes up a conversation with her and things proceed from there. Through her he hears about this new suitor for <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy</a>. From <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a>'s descriptions he is not well disposed to this person. He also manages to get <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a> to be more watchfull. So far nothing has happened to force Van Helsing to come to London. This won't occur until Harker returns and starts talking with Seward about his experiences with the other vampyr in Dracul's castle. Harker is one of the Orient Express travellers.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sergei figures out there are more vampires in London. Someone created the ones who created Spike - could be an early victim of Sergei's.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Not content to remain in Transylvania Prince Sergei originally started acquiring properties in Budapest and then in Prague and Bucharest. In both cases he favored hotel/inn type properties. This allowed him secure places to reside when travelling. It was while travelling in Roumania that he encountered <a href="slayers.htm">Princess Maria</a> and became her friend.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In 1879 Sergei invested heavily in a theatre and hotel interest started by Richard D´Oyly Carte whom he knew of through a solicitor he had engaged for other business interests. As the mega-corps began to crystalize he moved into the Hotel and Entertainment segments. /* need to name his media group */ <a href="rianna.htm">Rianna Scarlett</a> is one of the media stars signed to his mega-corp.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* <a href="http://www.savoygroup.com">Savoy Hotel</a> - use this for Sergei in Valen -  expand the holdings to include the Hilton Group and other hotel chains under <a href="../info/bts_holdings.htm">BTS Holdings</a> for use in the Mega-Corp future of <a href="../info/alt_earth.htm">Alt. Earth</a> */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Make sure Sergei becomes holder of Blackstone Group - or re-write history as required */</p>
