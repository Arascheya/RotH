<p class="regtxt5">/* add appearance */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia Cassini is a raving paranoid, who is not entirely wrong. Her life has been spent tracking and infiltrating various Galdius Dei groups and networks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia plays Ayasha Zeriss, a member of Bronson's Raiders, in Conflict for Mars.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia owns the building her laundromat, Under the Bridge Laundry, is in. She leases space to people she trusts, although she has rented a few carefully isolated areas to regular businesses for cover. The building is </p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia is a very damaged young woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">is broken - has no trust for people actually living in her world<br/>
    family was loose collection of beings living in the same place - there was only minimal touch for injuries<br/>
        family destroyed her sense of self, sense of worth, and acceptance of her body - she is convinced she is ugly, stupid, and selfish<br/>
        she only feels value in the conspiracy theories she researches<br/>
    parents had no idea what they were doing and would have preferred the children to only be seen when convenient<br/>
    touch makes her very uncomfortable, although she can physically crave it from the very few she trusts<br/>
    identifies only with fictional characters, able to feel great amounts of emotion and empathy for them<br/>
    does not trust anything living people say - words are lies, used to manipulate the listener into doing what the speaker wants<br/>
    religion is a tool of mass control - she does not understand how anyone can find comfort in it<br/>
    finds dating creepy and horrifying, especially the way men try to come on to interesting women<br/>
    finds pregnancy grotesque - feels pitty that any woman would want to wreck her body in that way<br/>
    plays MMO games, but never in a group - likes to see people in the world, but wants nothing to do with them<br/>
    has played some single person games, but most of them bore her. Only Shadow Journeys held her interest<br/>
    she is curious about the announced RotH MMO<br/>
    she will warm to Shan slightly<br/>
    she may warm to Ash Aragon slightly</p>
