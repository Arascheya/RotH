<p class="pagecaption">Alucinia Matthilda Cassaveras aka Leia Cassini</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* add appearance */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia Cassini is a raving paranoid, who is not entirely wrong. Her life has been spent tracking and infiltrating various Galdius Dei groups and networks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia started life as Alucinia Cassaveras, a semi-wealthy socialite, connected to the vast Cassaveras fortunes through her father. She took odd jobs through high school, not wanting to rely on her father for hand-outs, which came with many uncomfortable strings. Her junior year she started working at the laundromat. During her senior year, the owner had a heart attack and wanted to retire. Leia agreed to buy him out, over time, using the income from the business. She moved out of the family home as soon as she reached legal age. At that point she started going by Leia Cassini, using computer skills she had honed to erase her old identity and replace it with her new one. The only person she told was her uncle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia inherited her uncle's entire holdings, making her a very wealthy woman. Her uncle willed the entire Cassini holdings to her because he had no children of his own and valued Leia for trying to get make it on her own. he had no use for the rest of the family that lived on entitlements from the companies and were waiting for the inheritance. He left her a letter explaining this, however, it was misplaced and she has not yet seen it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia doesn't want the money. She considers it dirty and tainted from the methods her family used to aquire it. She uses the management group to distance herself from it and to maintains her empire. She communicates with them through the net. Her general distrust has led to planting all sorts of back doors into the various networks the holding company uses to manage its activities. She is sole owner, so has final say in all things related to her properties. She has her money in various Cayman Island and Swiss banks, locked down in a non-traceable way. She has her accountants maintain scrupulous books for all holdings to prevent any hint of impropriety.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her company has sent in a response to the RFP for Commodore's Row, part of the old Brushwick naval area. She expects to get the green light for her redevelopment, since it preserves the historical aspects of the site as well as adding cash flow options.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia owns the building her laundromat, Under the Bridge Laundry, is in. She leases space to people she trusts, although she has rented a few carefully isolated areas to regular businesses for cover.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia plays Ayasha Zeriss, a member of Bronson's Raiders, in Conflict for Mars.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia is a very damaged young woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">is broken - has no trust for people actually living in her world<br/>
    family was loose collection of beings living in the same place - there was only minimal touch for injuries<br/>
        family destroyed her sense of self, sense of worth, and acceptance of her body - she is convinced she is ugly, stupid, and selfish<br/>
        she only feels value in the conspiracy theories she researches<br/>
    parents had no idea what they were doing and would have preferred the children to only be seen when convenient<br/>
    touch makes her very uncomfortable, although she can physically crave it from the very few she trusts<br/>
    identifies only with fictional characters, able to feel great amounts of emotion and empathy for them<br/>
    does not trust anything living people say - words are lies, used to manipulate the listener into doing what the speaker wants<br/>
    religion is a tool of mass control - she does not understand how anyone can find comfort in it<br/>
    finds dating creepy and horrifying, especially the way men try to come on to interesting women<br/>
    finds pregnancy grotesque - feels pitty that any woman would want to wreck her body in that way<br/>
    plays MMO games, but never in a group - likes to see people in the world, but wants nothing to do with them<br/>
    plays Conflict for Mars as part of a loose team. All members are typically solo players in other games. Team has a few wins.<br/>
    has played some single person games, but most of them bore her. Only Shadow Journeys held her interest<br/>
    she is curious about the announced RotH MMO<br/>
    she will warm to Shan slightly<br/>
    she may warm to Ash Aragon slightly more</p>
