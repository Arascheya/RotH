<p class="regtxt5">Natasha is Shan'sadvisor and primary dance instructor at school.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Natasha Krikova knew a Strange Attractor when she was about Shan's age. She was in the premier Moskava Academy of Dance. Svetlana Asanova was a good friend of the same age (maybe lover?). She became sick once with the change virus and was awakened shortly after. Sveta told Natasha all about it and had Natasha help her with some of her duties. They were together until Sveta was killed during an event. She will tell Shan her story after the student is killed in a practice room and she and Shan have taken down the creature.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Natasha has always felt that Sveta died because she had no interest in living, that she eded up performing suicide by creature. She will not want Shan to follow that path.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Natasha is associate director of Dance Division at Juilliard. Her area is ballet and she likes to teach the new students, conditioning them for the coming intensity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ms Korikova will be another one supporting Shan after she sees Shan is a Strange. She is 42 years of age when Shan changes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Korikova lives in a small apartment over the Baba Iaga Deli at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Korchma+Taras+Bulba&data=!1m8!1m3!1d3!2d-74.003133!3d40.722959!2m2!1f90!2f90!4f75!2m9!1e1!2m4!1s6r89tWiFGDT2SDwPjqG5Sw!2e0!9m1!6s%C2%A9+2013+Google!5m2!1s6r89tWiFGDT2SDwPjqG5Sw!2e0!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x0%3A0xb678360fe702eee6!3m8!1m3!1d206!2d-74.003085!3d40.723027!3m2!1i1648!2i836!4f13.1!4m2!3d40.7229759!4d-74.0031177&fid=5">357 W.
