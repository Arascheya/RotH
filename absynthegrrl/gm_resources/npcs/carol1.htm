<p class="regtxt5">Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was born in 1839. He was educated at the military school in Munster and the artillery school in Berlin.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In 1866 Count Phillipe of Flandra refused the Romanian throne. Prince Carol was then asked and he accepted. A relative of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Carol was pro-German, a view that was not shared by most Romanians.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Carol led Romanian troops during the <a href="../info/rus_ottoman.htm">Russian-Ottoman War</a>. Victory brought Romanian independence on 10th May 1877.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">His daughter <a href="slayer.htm">Maria</a> is the slayer at the time of the Hut in London.</p>
