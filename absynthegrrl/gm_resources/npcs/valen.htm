<p class="regtxt5">Description: 5'6", black hair, green eyes, medium build, well muscled if she is working out. The cyberware makes here weigh about half again as much as an average person her size, it also makes her 0.25 times faster and stronger. The cyberware creates a higher heat load than normal flesh, so Valen has cooling problems in warmer climates. This is particularly bad in hot and humid places. It is life threatening as the heat builds up and cooks her from the inside.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She is a truly multi-processing person, with the cyberware giving her additional capabilities. She struggles to explain how her interfacing works to her friends, because she becomes a part of any machine she can connect to. She sees through her senses and the machine's, her thoughts control it directly, without requiring her to move her own form. It is something wonderful, but almost indescribable without similar experience.</p>
