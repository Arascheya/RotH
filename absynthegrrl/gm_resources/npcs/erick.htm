<p class="pagecaption">Erick</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick runs the <a href="../places/eternia/absynthe.htm">Absynthe Palace</a>. He was also one of the people rescued in Kali's first rescue mission. He likes hanging at <a href="../places/eternia/devilscathouse.htm">Devil's Cathouse</a> when he's not at the <a href="../places/eternia/absynthe.htm">Absynthe Palace</a> or on runs.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick grooves on the risks of salvage missions, so he takes on more than the usual share. He remains on good terms with <a href="dimentia.htm">Dementia</a>. For a time he tried to get her to date him. In the end they became and remain friends. Erick is straight and more than a little bit attracted to <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a>. He is between lovers at this time. <a href="ennui.htm">Ennui</a> is probably his closest friend. He believes her to be one of the most uninteresting people in Death City although she is also his closest confidant when he needs to talk about something.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick is fairly new to Death City, having arrived about four months before <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a>. He had some rough times right after arrival. In his case it was the screaming scarlet hornies.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick lives in the back of the absynthe house he runs.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He truly pities the <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_shadow.htm">Shadow Walkers</a> and is appalled by their plight. He will not knowingly befriend one since he doesn't want the heartache that all too often comes when they die. It is a real shock to him when <a href="ennui.htm">Ennui</a> confesses that she is one. It will force him to deal with his thoughts and feelings about <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_shadow.htm">Walkers</a> and other things in ways he wouldn't have otherwise.</p>
