<p class="regtxt5">Calipha Alia ni Sharazar ni Ishala, Gem of the Lotus, Most High Empress of the Light, Defender of the Faithful, Sweet Spring of Bountiful Goodness is the current <a href="empress.htm">Calipha</a> of the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>. She is in the middle years of her reign. She is a reasonable ruler, wise enough, compassionate enough, and just a hint decadent. She has a great heart and will fight for her friends and reward those who aid her in a lavish way. She came to the throne shortly after the Hell Gate Wars.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider the idea that she slips out and wonders among the people. In her younger days as an adventuress, slipping through the towns, villages, and tribal bands of the empire. Later, as a person about Jakara. It would give her a better view of her people.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alia was born among the <a href="../Eritsani/eri_sa.htm">Eri'sa</a> and lived with them until she was found by the Lotus Mother's seekers when she was fourteen. She has held to her <a href="../Eritsani/eri_sa.htm">Eri'sa</a> roots, disappearing from the palace on occasion to wander with her tribe or slip through the city in disguise.</p>
