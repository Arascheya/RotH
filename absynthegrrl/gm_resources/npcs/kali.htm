<p class="pagecaption">Kali - of <a href="../../docs/docs_index.htm#death" NAME="death">Death City</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She has this weird mix of insecurity, vulnerability, confidence and daring at the same time." - Bob M.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This sums her up quite well. Kali is a character in transition. She has arrived in Death City after a lifetime of not allowing herself to step out of any of the Shadows. She still craves the Shadows, however she also wants to be more now. Kali has not often allowed herself to do what she wants if it conflicts with anyone close to her at the time. She wants to break out of this but it will not be easy for her. Part of her wants to avoid the complications that come with being partnered and part of her craves the security of someone to lean on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stands about 5'8" tall. She is fluent in dance and has a dancer's physique. Added to this will be the strength training from working at Temple Heath. She will look like someone beginning acrobatics training. Her face is hard and somewhat plain. When she smiles she is pretty. Her hair is dark red and similar to Marla Singer's - wild, tangled, coarse and wavy. No matter how much she works it with combs, brushes, etc. it tangles and flies about. She keeps it fairly long, having an ingrained hatred of shorter hair. Her eyes are a warm grey unless she is angry, then they are a very icy, pale, grey. Her voice is a low alto with dark over tones and the vaguest hint of an eastern european accent. She has a flat stomach, good muscle tone, and definition. She is just short of <a href="../info/dancing.htm">obsessive</a> when it comes to dance practice. Once she settles in she will practice daily, both at <a href="../places/eternia/k_apartment.htm">her flat</a> and at <a href="../places/eternia/freda_gym.htm">Freda's Gym</a>. She also likes to hang out with the Temple Heath crowd at the <a href="../places/eternia/adam_eve.htm">Adam and Eve</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Body mods: tattoo on right shoulder, arm-band tattoo on left arm of razor wire, rose vine and a red, a blue, and a black rose blossom, pierced ears - two piercings per side<a href="file://z:/shapes/k_fp_faq.htm#pierce">,</a> multiply pierced <a href="../../common/club_images/kali_pierce.jpg">navel</a> with purple stone in a silver setting at the top and two silver piercings to form an equilateral triangle, pierced nipples with barbell style inserts, genital piercing with another purple stone as well. She also has two <a href="../../common/club_images/cobra1.jpg">Egyptian Cobra</a> snakes tattooed from her hip bone down along the folds of her thighs, tongues almost touching on her pubic bone. Their tails wrap around and dip down to entwine at the base of her spine. They are detailed in rich shimmering colors, appearing almost alive under the right lighting. Jasmine at <a href="../places/eternia/dheadtattoo.htm">Death's Head Tattoo</a> did the piercings and Marianne did all the tattoos except for her <a href="../../common/club_images/tattoo.jpg">shoulder one</a> which she had from the Realms. At first she shaves unwanted hair, after she gets to know the people at <a href="../places/eternia/dheadtattoo.htm">Death's Head Tattoo</a> she switches to going there for waxing sessions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As leader of the Extraction Team she adds a last tattoo, a rose vine climbing a razorwire trellis up her back. For each fallen team member she adds a single black bloom with the name in the center. She also creates a small shrine in her room on the train where she keeps a statue of Kali and a candle for each fallen member. The candles remain lit any time she is in the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She has transformed in appearance as a result of her first mission and from Death City itself. This is a head fuck for her - she spent most of her life feeling ugly and hiding behind it. Now she can still tell herself she is but the physical reality gives it the lie. She has become far less modest now that she is happy with her looks. There are momentary twinges of embarrassment once in a while, especially right after Tracy moves in with her. She is not self-concious about running around in next to nothing. As an example she would strip to her underwear and go swimming if the mood struck her or someone suggested it for fun.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She adopts several modes of general appearance. For <a href="../../common/club_images/kali_extraction1.png">extraction missions</a> she favors high cut, racer back leotards with <a href="file:///z:/shapes/kali5.htm">camo pants</a>, black leather biker jacket, and heavy boots, sometimes she will strip to just the leotard. For working at Temple Heath she favors boiler suits with a sports bra top so she can drop the top of the suit if she gets too warm. For clubbing she favors gothic items that allow her mobility and wispy thin things when dancing with the band. For general wear she adopts either gothic or grunge style attire depending on her mood.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She survived her family however her inner boundaries are badly damaged. There is info on this in <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_demons.htm">inner demons</a> and her <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/kali_full/p_diary.htm">diary</a>. She has trouble not taking something said and internalizing it, using it to flame-strike her psyche. She has a younger sister who is on anti-anxiety drugs, sees a therapist twice a week and still lives in the same town as her parents. Her sister has never dated or managed any sort of relationship with another person. She barely manages to go to work. Kali has fared better than that.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali dances to escape. At first, just in the darkness of the <a href="../places/eternia/devilscathouse.htm">Devil's Cathouse</a>, later in other places as well. When she is dancing the nasty voice in her head is silent, allowing her a peace that she has never known. She will also slip out of Temple Heath or other places and dance to escape stress or nervous energy spikes. The energy spikes get worse after her trip into the void. She will also become the stage dancer for <a href="loves_bitch.htm">Love's Bitch</a>. She favors the more bizarre colors in cosmetics, see the <a href="http://www.manicpanic.com">Manic Panic</a> site for ideas. As time goes on she might expand into aerial dance as well. She could have rigging hung from the upper Cathouse through the floor and into the dance area below.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali is a <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_shadow.htm">Shadow Walker</a>. This makes her restless and is one of the things that drives her to the <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_extract.htm">Extraction</a> <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_org_chart.htm">Teams</a>. This restlessness also drives her to create <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_leopardess.htm">Leopardess</a>, her locomotive. <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_leopardess.htm">Leopardess</a>, the first of the K-666 series of locomotives, which becomes the standard for her <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_extract.htm">Extraction</a> <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_org_chart.htm">Teams</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her favored mode of transportation in the cities is a battered mountain bike. She is a bit of a hot-dogger with it, jumping things, riding the edge of embankments and the like. This goes along with her new-found confidence in her mind-body connection.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali loves the storms, wind, and leaves of fall - it is her favorite season in Eternia. She hated rain in the Realms but has come to like it more in Eternia. Now she will ride or walk through the rain and think little of it, particularly if she is headed toward home where she can relax in a warm tub when she arrives damp and chilled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She will forget to eat even though she likes food and loves to explore new tastes and cuisines. When she does eat her favorite foods are breakfast foods, steak and kidney pie, and salads. Although, she likes food and will try just about anything once. Her usual at the diner near Temple Heath is a small cobb salad and grapefruit juice. Steak and kidney pie at the Adam and Eve is another usual. If she's eating at the flat, morning food will be granola or oat meal, night food will be grilled meat, simple salads, or ramen noodles with cheese and frozen veggies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali can cook and will do so more often when Merris is around or after Tracy moves in. She can follow recipes(<a href="../recipe_inx.htm#kali">Kali's Recipes</a>) and from there learns to improvise some of her specialties. She likes almost any cuisine including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_cuisine">Czech</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cuisine">Russian</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_cuisine">Ukrainian</a> (see also <a href="http://natashaskitchen.com/">Natasha's Kitchen</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_Turkey">Turkish</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_cuisine">Greek</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_cuisine">Polish</a>. Favorite drinks are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_stout">Imperial Stout</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retsina">Retsina</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouzo">Ouzo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvass">Kvass</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slivovitz">Slivovitz</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tweaks and Twitches: she has trouble not taking things personally, she gets more and more wound up if she doesn't allow herself time to dance off the excess, she has a very hard time believing she is important to her friends, her energy levels are borderline manic, without the release of the depressive side of the cycle, she handles stress better than she believes - she thinks she is a total wuss while her friends view her as a solid rock. She has always believed she is not good enough and inadequate at things that really matter, including relationships.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider - intensify something for the monthly cycles - not pms, but some effect<a href="file://z:/shapes/k_fp_faq.htm"> </a>this would be a good place for her to get a 2 or 3 day crash from her regular mania - crash to almost complete torpor</p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider - Kali never gets the relationship thing figured out, she never gets the time and perspective she needs, partly because of the war and partly because she can't quite shed enough of her internal baggage. <a href="katya_dc.htm">Katya</a> does because the baggage isn't there</p>
<!--
<p class="regtxt5">Stephie is about 5 ft 6 and 105 pounds, so Kali would be about 5 ft 8 and 115 to 125 - she is all lean muscle mass</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider following body mods as time goes by - black panther tatoo on pubic area, clit piercing, arm band tatoo of barbed wire, roses, and something as a framework for the roses.</p>-->
