<p class="pagecaption">River Drake - this is the original concept</p>
<p class="regtxt5">By necessity, rivers are the roads of the wilderness. Even after civilization extends its grasp, much cargo continues to move on the rivers. The River Drake is a paddle-wheel riverboat that has traveled the Great River for many years, serving commerce amidst persistent rumors of darker motives.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The River Drake is a large river boat that works the ports of the Great River from the sea coast as far inland as Crumbling Skull Rapids, easily moving bulky cargo that is otherwise inconvenient to move by mule, camel, or wagon. Most boatmen avoid cruising the river at night, due to the risks of shifting sandbars, drifting logs. and the possibility of bandits. The River Drake, in contrast, moves at night and stops at the river ports during the days. Many a farmer has been startled to see its large silhouette quietly moving through the river mists in the dark of night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For the few who know what propels the River Drake, its nocturnal habits are more easily explained. Most people have seen the glistening slime trails of garden slugs shining as dawn breaks. Just as those slugs search for food in the cool, moist night, so also do the rare giant slugs of the Darkmist Forest. Eight to 10 feet long, these slimy monsters have never been domesticated; at least not until now. For in fact, they are the living motors of the River Drake. Controlled by old Furth, the slugdrover, they creep along their treadmills for hours each night, powerfully turning the stern paddle-wheel. The slugs are never seen by the residents of the ports, who nonetheless comment on the offensive smells when the River Drake happens to be upwind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Curiously, the boat is not owned by humans (as is most of the river traffic), but by riverfolk, a furry, water-loving, nonhuman race. Though both their features and figures have a faintly human cast to them, their appearance reminds many of otters. Riverfolk usually avoid dealings with humans, due largely to the prejudice shown towards them. In the past, it was not uncommon for rivermen (male riverfolk) and rivergynes (female riverfolk) to be robbed, beaten, and even enslaved by humans. Such incidents are fewer now, since most river folk wisely stay near their settlements in the marshes and distant reaches of the rivers and lakes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Captain of the River Drake is Ristya Darkbrow, an alluring rivergyne very wise in the ways of the Great River, and skilled with both combat and magic. Helping with her tasks are her twin sons, Corinth Lefthand and Calyx Bristleneck. There are eight other members of the crew, including six humans, an adolescent rivergyne, and Occo Fiden, a half-breed human of obscure parentage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The River Drake is a cargo vessel, carrying bulky goods from port to port along the Great River. Many farmers have small docks from which they load their crops on the boat. Since the River Drake moves at night, farmers hang lanterns on the docks to signal they have goods to be shipped. Hides and lumber are also typical cargoes, as are trade goods from the cities to smaller villages. The boat is fairly slow, with its many stops, but shipping rates are reasonably low, so that the cargo hold is nearly full much of the time. The Captain prefers not to carry passengers or livestock, but occasionally will do so when paid an extra fee.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Layout</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The River Drake has four decks. From top to bottom, they are the Bridge Deck, Cabin Deck, Main Deck, and Slug Deck. Below the Slug Deck are the Bilges. From forward aft (front to rear), the ship's three masts are the Foremast, Topmast, and Shortmast. The Topmast actually extends through the Bridge Deck down to the Cabin Deck.
</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bridge Deck</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ladders(D) on either side of the Cabin Deck are used to reach the Bridge Deck.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A. Bridge: This is the highest compartment on the River Drake, and the place with the best visibility. It is surrounded with windows, with a windowed door in the after bulkhead (wall). The Captain steers the River Drake from here, using a large, spoked wooden wheel (C). Although hooked to a complex set of ropes and pulleys, the wheel is not physically connected to a rudder, but is an enchanted object that manipulates water currents to turn the River Drake. Only Bosun Tam and the riverfolk crew know this. By clever use of the wheel, the Captain can make seemingly impossible maneuvers, like slowly moving sideways to the dock.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">B. Dryout: The flat area aft of the Bridge is used to dry ropes and canvas (and sometimes clothes). It is sometimes used for sun-bathing by the crew when they are underway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cabin Deck</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Four ladders from the Main Deck lead up to hatches in the Cabin Deck. These hatches can be locked from above, but are normally left unlocked.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A. Captain's Cabin: Ristya Darkbrow, Captain of the River Drake, lives in this cabin, which has two windows forward, and windowed doors to either side. The base of the Topmast stands in the center of the cabin.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">She has a very expensive bed, styled in the manner of high-class riverfolk. Made with a Finely crafted wooden frame, it is set with inlays of many exotic woods. Within lies a heap of aromatic herbs, purchased at great expense from distant lands. To the ignorant, it seems that she sleeps in a box filled with smelly weeds. To other riverfolk, it shows that Ristya is much wealthier than would seem appropriate for a mere "river trucker." When Ristya sleeps, she keeps her weapons beside her, wears her am ulet (but no other clothing), and usually holds her switch in her hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Also in her cabin are two trunks. One contains her clothing, while the other is an airtight trunk packed with sealed blocks of herbs for her bed. These heibs are non-magical, and have little value except to other riverfolk. A mesh bag hangs from a hook on the Topmast Within, she keeps various fresh fruits and vegetables, used as snacks. The after bulkhead of her cabin is painted with a realistic mural of a marsh.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">B. Corinth's Cabin: His cabin is on the port side (the left, facing forward) of the River Drake, with a windowed door as entry. His bed is a more common version of Ristya's, being a simple wooden frame Filled with rushes and herbs collected from the riverside. An orange curtain along the forward bulkhead of his hides his hanging clothes. The aft bulkhead has a mural of a tree in autumn foliage. He hangs his weapons and boots from pegs on the remaining bulkhead. In addition, he keeps an extra dagger concealed within his bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">C. Calyx's Cabin: His cabin, on the starboard side (the right, facing forward) of the Riyer Drake, also has a windowed door as entry. He sleeps on a pile of rushes and heibs thrown on the floor. There is an pale green curtain along the forward bulkhead of his cabin, but he keeps nothing behind it. The aft bulkhead has a mural of small shrubs leafing out in the spring. Although there are pegs on the remaining bulkhead, Calyx rarely uses them. lnstead, he just drops his things on the floor. When Mulya sleeps in his cabin, she hangs up his things, but this condition only lasts until the next time Calyx uses them, and subsequently drops them. He is not annoyed by her neatness; it is merely unimportant to him.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">D. Bosun Tarn's Cabin: His cabin is on the port side, aft of Corinth's. Although small and containing many items, the cabin seems roomy due to Tarn's rigid discipline. He has an abundance of built-in drawers and shelves, with their contents always placed exactly the same way. His clothes are tightly rolled and stowed, and every inch of storage is used. The wood in the cabin shines with a rich warmth. Brass hinges and handles sparkle merrily. Intricately knotted ropework is displayed decoratively. A small locker contains rolls of bright ribbons. He sleeps in a hammock, which is carefully put away when not in use.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">E. Bartholomew's Cabin: His cabin is on the starboard side, aftof Calyx's. The cabin is virtually empty - a hammock is stretched between two hooks. and a duffle bag in the corner contains spare clothes. He seems to have nothing else of a personal nature.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">F. Deckhand's Cabin: The largest cabin, with three windows and one windowed door (aft). There are three sets of bunk beds fastened to the bulkheads in the front of the cabin. Each set is a stack of three bunks, so that there are nine sleeping places total in the cabin. Each crewman has a footlocker, stowed either under the lowermost bunk or under a window. In the center of the cabin is a small table with three chairs. Often the deckhands play cards here. The most popular game is called "Gangup," a gambling game for three in which the object seems to be for two players to take all the money of the third. Wilari, Occo, Black William, Furth and Little Morgie sleep here. The other four bunks are vacant.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">G. Ladders, to Bridge Deck.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">H. Hatches, to Main Deck.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">J. Base of Topmast.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">L. Shortmast.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Main Deck</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Four ladders from the Main Deck lead up to hatches in the Cabin Deck. These hatches can be locked from above, but are normally left unlocked. Four hatches in the Main Deck lead down to ladders from the Slug Deck. These hatches are normally locked from below, preventing access to the Slug Deck. A fifth large hatch also opens down to the Slug Deck. This allows the slugs and their food to be hauled up and down.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A. Foremast: This mast supports the hoist, used to load and unload cargo. It is also used to raise and lower the skiff.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">B. Hoist mechanism: Used to raise and lower the hoist. This is Occo Fiden's station when at the dock.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">C. Skiff: A small boat, propelled with oars. One person can manage the skiff, although it can carry a sizable load. Wilari usually operates the skiff.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">D. Main Doors: Entry into the Cargo Hold. The doors can open in or out, and one can be kept closed while the other is opened. There is a very small door in one of the main doors, so that a person can enter without unfastening them. Normally the main doors are locked. Ristya and Black William carry the only keys.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">E. Cargo Hold: The large area used to stow cargo. Typical cargoes include agricultural products, leather, trade goods, and sometimes building materials. However, most anything will be carried for the right price.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">F. Outer walkways.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">G. Ladders to Cabin Deck: Hatches at top may be locked from above; normally unlocked.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">H. Hatches to Slug Deck: Usually kept locked from below.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slug Deck</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Access is from four ladders leading down from hatches in the Main Deck. This deck is where the giant slugs provide the motive power for the River Drake.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A. Slugways: Flexible wooden treadmills. As the slugs glide along their slime trail, they propel the slugways beneath them in the opposite direction. On the starboard side, the slugs crawl forward (towards the bow of the River Drake), so the slugway moves aft. On the port side, the slugs move aft, so their slugway moves forward. A major task of Furth, the slugdrover, is to keep the slugs moving steadily and keeping a proper distance from each other. He manages the slugs through telepathic communication, continually convincing their small brains that delicious food is just ahead. When he needs extra speed, he persuades them that a giant is coming from behind with a ton of salt!</p>

<p class="regtxt9">B. Turntables: Gears in the bilges connect the slugways to the turntables, keeping them turning clockwise. The turntable shafts drive belts (also in the bilges) that connect aft to the paddle-wheel. As the paddle rotates, the River Drake moves forward.
</p>

<p class="regtxt9">C. Slug stalls: Slugs that are not working on the slugways are kept here. This is where they feed and are bathed. Windows around the stalls are of little help in removing the smell of the slugs, but Furth never seems to mind the stench. However, he is quick to notice the changed smell of the slime when a slug becomes diseased or infested by parasites. Note that shutters can be used to close and lock the windows.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">D. Storage: A narrow room used to store belts and other spares for the slugway/turntable mechanism. The belts are hung from the ceiling. Furth can barely move around in this room.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">E. Storage: This room contains numerous small kegs. When the slugs are in heat, Furth collects a thick, syrupy fluid that oozes out just below their stalked eyes. Called "limexus," it is used as a base for perfumes, and can be sold for a good price to perfumeries. A full keg is sealed with wax to keep the limexus fresh.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">F. Storage: Furth keeps medical supplies for the slugs in this room. There is an assortment of exceedingly sharp knives, so long as to be virtual swords, that Furth can use to perform minor surgery on the slugs.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">G. Hoses: Slugs need to be kept moist and clean. There's nothing worse than a dried-up slug! Furth uses the hoses to spray the slugs while they are on the slugways, and to scrub and wash them in their stalls. When the slime begins to build up on the floors, Furth washes it away through small openings below the windows in the after bulkhead (rear wall).</p>

<p class="regtxt9">H. Hatches: Furth prefers to keep locked the small hatches at the top of the ladders, so that no one will come down to agitate his slugs. As a result, others have to knock loudly on a hatch, then patiently wait for Furth to open it. This especially irritates Calyx. Usually, Furth has no visitors except for Little Morgie, since most people find the smell of the slugs overwhelmingly awful.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bilges</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The bilges are dark, confining, awash with water and slime, and exceedingly dangerous due to the chaos of gears, belts, shafts, and the return loop of the slugways. No person in his right mind would even enter the bilges, much less work there. Strangely, Little Morgie, the bilge-crawler, enjoys his work, and thinks of his job as prestigious. If he has anything hidden in the bilges, there is surely no one else on the River Drake who knows of it.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Access to the bilges is through the bilge grates found just below each of the hose racks in the Slug Deck. The hoses can be hooked up to pump out the bilges, when even Little Morgie finds them too wet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Personalities</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rystya</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ristya Darkbrow. a Rivergyne. Ht. 5'7", Wt. 166#. Age: 42. Q Fighting Prowess: Excellent. Q Magic Ability: Good. C2, C3, C5.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ristya is Captain of the River Drake. She is addressed as "Ristya" by the other riverfolk, as "Captain" by the remaining crew, and as "Captain Dark" by most residents of the river ports. She has a striking dark mane, with thick dark brows that are combed back over her ears. Ristya always wears the same outfit in public, a thin jump suit of deep brown leather, with barely visible bands of an even darker brown. Her ankle-high boots are thin and supple.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">On the River Drake, she wears an amulet of a dark green stone shot with fine red lines. A leather switch decorated with tiny shells hangs at her left hip, and she wears a thin, stiff piercing sword on her right hip. Ashore, she does not wear the amulet, and typically replaces the switch with a small quiver holding six arrows, plus a riverbow slung over her left shoulder.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ristya's amulet warns her when magical items are brought onto the River Drake. It does not identify the type of magic, but does indicate to her a rough location of the item. It is keyed to her personally. It gives no warning to anyone else that tries to use it, nor does it warn Ristya of the presence of magical items that she has personally held. Thus, when a crewman has something of magic, he will bring it for her to briefly hold, so the amulet will not repeatedly sound the alarm each time the crewman steps back on board. Her switch is also magical, causing an intense shock when brushed against another person. The members of her crew quickly learn to obey her orders as Captain, and it rare that an individual ever needs to feel the switch a second rime.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Corinth Lefthand</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Corinth Lefthand. a Riverman, Hi. 5'8", Wt. 155#, Age: 25. Q Fighting Prowess: Good. 0 Magic Ability: Good, Cl, C4.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Corinth and Calyx are the twin sons of Ristya Darkbrow. Although quite similar in physical appearance, Corinth's lower neck is only lightly furred. Their dress is usually quite distinct, Corinth favoring oranges and reds. A typical outfit of his is a pair of mottled orange trousers topped by a tight-fitting rust jersey.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Corinth's favored weapons are longsword and dagger, which he can use equally well in either hand. He wears the sword on the right and the dagger on the left, drawing them cross-handed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Calyx Bristleneck</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Calyx Bristleneck. QRiverman,Ht.5'8". Wt. 155#.Age: 25. Q Fighting Prowess: Good. Q Magic Ability: Good. Cl, C6.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Calyx differs from his twin brother in having a thick, bristly ruff around his lower neck. These bristles stand out from his neck when he is angry, a fairly common occurrence. Calyx favors greens and yellows. A typical outfit is light green trousers with a yellow waistband, and a loose dark green blouse.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">His favored weapons include both broadsword and riverbow. He usually carries his riverbow when on the River Drake, wearing his sword only when going ashore or expecting trouble.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mulya Longthumb</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Mulya Longthumb Rivergyne,Ht.5'4".Wt.118#,Age: 13.  Fighting Prowess: Average. Q Magic Ability: Poor, C2, C3.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Mulya is unrelated to Ristya. Her fur is tawny, unlike the darker fur of Ristya and her sons. She was brought on board the River Drake by Corinth and Calyx a year ago, and usually sleeps in one of their cabins or on deck. She is very athletic, being probably the best climber and swimmer on the boat. She is being trained in riverbow by Calyx, in longsword by Corinth, and in magic by Ristya.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bosun Tam</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Bosun Tam. a Human, Ht. 6'1", Wt. 245#. Age: 52. Q Fighting Prowess: Very Good.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Tam is in charge of all deck and small boat operations on the River Drake. He boasts an impressively muscled upper body and a grip that could break the hand of a shopclerk. Though his belly shows perhaps too much fondness for the rice beer served in the river ports, he is a deceptively quick and agile man, with remark-able balance. His stamina is excellent. He normally wears brightly-colored loose trousers and an open leather vest, but neither headgear nor shoes. His torso flaunts numerous tattoos, the most dramatic being a scene of a river monster pulling a man under the water. There are no tattoos on his arms or face.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Tam insists on all the boat gear being exactly and neatly in its place. A sure way to provoke his anger is to cause a mess on deck. Every line is always stowed properly, even decoratively. The brightwork gleams and is free of finger marks. The wood of the skiff shines with fresh varnish. There are brilliant ribbons trailing from the shortmast, in new color combinations each morning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bartholomew</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Bartholomew, a Human, Ht. 5'9", Wt. 178#, Age: 27.  Fighting Prowess: Average.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Bart is senior deckhand on the River Drake, taking charge of the other deckhands when Bosun Tam is busy or absent. Bart and Tam never leave the boat at the same time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Wilari</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Wilari. a Human. Hi. 5'5", Wt. 135#, Age: 23. Q Fighting Prowess: Average. Q Magic Ability: Average, C2.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Wilari is an ordinary deckhand. She often serves as coxswain in the skiff. Although she has been on the River Drake only slightly more than a year, she has learned boathandling and ropework to a high proficiency. In her spare time, she sometimes prepares small jars of healing potions, that she trades for various minor treats and luxuries.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Occo Fiden</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Occo Fiden. a Half-breed Human, Ht. 5'10", Wt. 196#. Age: 33. Q Fighting Prowess: Good.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Occo is an ordinary deckhand, and is in charge of the hoist on the foremast He supervises the loading and unloading of large items of cargo. In his 12 years on the River Drake, he has never been known to damage cargo while using the hoist. He never goes ashore, at least never further than the docks. He's not talkative, but is friendly enough with the crew.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Black William</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Black William, a Human, Ht. 5'11", Wt. 170#, Age: 40. Q Fighting Prowess: Poor, except Fair with a knife.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Black William is Cargo Master of the River Drake. As such, he supervises the stowage and protection of the cargo, and is responsible for the manifest and other written records. He is very talented with numbers as well as reading and writing in all the languages used along the river. Most of the other crewmen come to him when they have letters to be read or written.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Furth</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Furth. a Human, Ht. 6' 3", Wt. 315# .Age: 61. Q Fighting Prowess: Poor.  Magic Ability: Fair, but only with slug-magic, C2, C5.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Furth is slugdrover of the River Drake. He tends the slugs, and controls them when the boat is underway. He can communicate with them through telepathic spells, and heals them with a wide range of slug-curative spells. He is the only crewman who has been on the River Drake longer than the Captain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Little Morgie</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Little Morgie. a Human, Ht. 5'5", Wt. 130#. Age: 15. Q Fighting Prowess: Average in brawls or with clubs; otherwise Poor. Can use a club with either hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Morgie is the bilge-crawler of the River Drake. He makes inspections and repairs inside the hull and below the bilge-grates. He is a moderately skilled carpenter.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Scenario Suggestions</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario I: In the Heat ot the Night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In a river port tavern, you overhear some racist punks making plans to "burn out those stinking riverfolk" when the River Drake arrives. Early the next morning, your party is waiting at the dock when the boat approaches. You warn the Captain of the trouble brewing, and she hires on your group as guards for the two days and one night the boat will be here. You should be able lo gain valuable combat experience, but may wind up in front of an unsympathetic magistrate when your group is charged with inciting a riot.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario 2: He Slimed Me!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Regardless of what people say about bushels of turnips and crates of cabbages; there simply must be some valuable treasures stored in the cargo hold of the River Drake. Now, what's the best way for a little band of thieves to sneak on board and get their share of the loot? Maybe they could swim around to the river side of the boat and climb in one of those small windows close to the waterline.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario 3: My But it's a Long River.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The adventurers need to go far upriver to link up with Mikal Del Brionfal Tobrannon's caravan at Crumbling Skull Rapids (consider arriving just before the bridge disappears). The River Drake is the only boat going that far. During the long trip, as they get acquainted with the crew, they can easily get caught up in the intrigues on board. Are the twins rivals for the good graces of their mother? Maybe each of them secretly approaches the adventurers, trying to persuade them to do some "dirty tricks" that will make his brother look bad. Do the riverfolk stealthily leave the boat at night when far from a river port? The adventurers mighttryto follow them to see what they're up to. They might notice that Black William talks with some disreputable characters when in port. Could he be operating his own smuggling racket on the River Drake, or even worse be a Stooge for the despicable drug runner, Keir Collis?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario4: Slugfest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Furth infonns the PCs that one of his slugs has died. After the PCs (ugh) help him (gaak) dispose of (retch) the rotting slug (barf), he proposes that the adventurers go to the Darkmist Forest to capture and bring back a giant slug (oh, wonderful!). Then he tells them just how much gold they'll get for this little task (Hey, this sounds pretty good after all!). Of course, they'll have to keep the slugs moist, well fed and healthy. If someone asks whether the slugs are dangerous, he responds honestly, "Oh no, they're very docile. /' ve never had any trouble with one." OK, this will be a nice relaxed interlude between the adventurers' normally hectic adventures. Make sure they take a large wagon and aplentiful supply of food and drink, to set off on this vacation in high spirits. Just remember this: slugs are NOT docile. Furth just makes it look and sound easy. They are constantly hungry and easily become sick with the vilestdiseases imaginable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Even an ordinary cargo boat can provide a wealth of scenarios, andthe River Drake is far from ordinary. With the exotic riverfolk and the bizarre source of propulsion, this riverboat should provide many entertaining evenings.</p>
