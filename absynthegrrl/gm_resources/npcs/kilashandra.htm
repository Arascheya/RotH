<p class="regtxt5">**History**</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Hometown / Region: Yew Nork City</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Biography:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shan has been studying dance for as long as she can remember. It is her one and only passion, driving her every waking thought. The happiest day of her life was when she was accepted into the Juilliard Dance program.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shan was scarred while saving another student from an attack by a thing from beyond the veil.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shan wears a small charm-like bracelet, given to her by Dr. Kim. It identifies her as an Awakened to the Medical and Police teams of the city. It guarantees she will only be treated by Awakened medical staff and police. Shealso wears a pare of small studsin her ears thatallow her to see the world in color. Her transformation into a Strange Attractor gave her the ability to see awakened by making everything else black and white.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shan lives with her parents, in their <a href="../../common/place_images/shan_condo.jpg">condo</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansonia_Hotel">Ansonia</a>. Her mom, Anushka Mariel Mason (McShane) (<a href="file://z:/shapes/anushka_m_01.jpg">pic 1</a> <a href="file://z:/shapes/anushka_m_02.jpg">pic 2</a>), works for the Museum of Batural History as the head of the linguistics deppartment. Her father, Arthur Mason (<a href="file://z:/shapes/arthur_m_01.jpg">pic 1</a> <a href="file://z:/shapes/arthur_m_02.jpg">pic 2</a>), is head of a socially concious credit union.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anushka was named by her mom for her mom's friend from Indusan. She worked her way up the museum ladder, starting as a linguistics analyst and ending up head of the department. She met Shan's father at a fundraiser where he was donating.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She works at the Upper West Side <a href="../places/arakov_market.htm">Arakov Market</a> and is good friends with <a href="talia_a.htm">Talia Arakov</a>, daughter of the owners.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Herbert Kodetova, lead on Tyan Hanan, is in her department at the museum. When Herbert died of illness, his
wife, Chani, took over lead on the Tyan Hanan research and expeditions. Chani found the tomb, undisturbed, in a remote section of hills. Consider: she could find a hidden cache elsewhere with the ruins of the crashed airframe stashed in it, if this would advance the story.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shan's mom remembers Section 13 from a series of brutal murders in the museum from a couple of years back. Attacks were from something slipping in around the gate under the museum.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shan and her mom watch urban fantasy and crime dramas - Shan uses this when having to tell her mom what she is. Her father only enjoys the crime dramas and goes and reads when they watch urban fantasy. He can't wrap his head around the alternative aspects of it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shan plays Nazrah Kaadesh, Supreme Commander Plaizaar Regiment and Queen of Tourneys in Conflict for Mars. She and Talia wrote the book on tactics in-game. They have been playing since launch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shan is driven and focused for the things she really wants. For things she doesn't want, she couldn't care less. This caused her trouble in school until academics directly influenced her chances to focus on dance. This will be her greatest strength as a strange - if she decides to focus on it.</p>
