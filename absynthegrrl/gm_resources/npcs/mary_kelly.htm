<p class="pagecaption">Mary Kelly</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mary was a friend of <a href="mereret.htm#emily_c">Emily Crooksley</a>(<a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a>) from the time shortly after she arrived in London in 1884. She would have been the 5th Ripper victim if <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> hadn't interfered.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She is 5' 7", average build, red haired, and has bright blue eyes. She tends to be reasonably friendly, unless angered, then her Irish temper would show. She was born in Limerick, Ireland and moved to Wales when young.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mary and <a href="mereret.htm">Mereret</a> become friends after the ripper is stopped. Before that, she knew the Mereret overlay of Emily Crooksley.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mary is 25 in 1888. Lestrade is 30.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mary does not read or write. Mereretwill set her up as an assistant to the Petries, after the Ripper is killed. They will insist she learn and will make resources available.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mary and Lestrade wed just before Mereret and the Hut leave London. This is largely due to Mere's insisteance. She knows Lestrade and Mary want children and someone to grow old with, neither of which Mere could provide.</p>
