<p class="pagecaption">Spike - aka William the Bloody</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Spike was formed in 1880 by Dru. He and Angel and some of the others have been working London in a quiet fashion. As the 90's advance Spike is getting more disdainful of the London situation. The Whitechapel murders start up again in late 93 as Spike begins to show less reguard for the authorities. This time victims found curiously drained of blood. Spike and his crowd are doing this. Find a policeman or two spiked to the docks down by Limehouse as well. This will draw the attention of the Watchers.</p>
