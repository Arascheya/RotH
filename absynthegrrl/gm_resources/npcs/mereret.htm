<p class="pagecaption">Mereret</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mereret was born in ancient Egypt, in 2636 during the 3rd Dynasty, the time of Djoser and <a href="imhotep.htm">Imhotep</a>. At this time a <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a>, <a href="iskandera.htm">Iskandera</a>, arrived through a space-time portal. Mereret was turned by this <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a> shortly before her destruction. She acquired the necklace, <a href="../items/talis_anubis.htm">Angelique's Necklace</a>, Iskandera had been wearing. This story is detailed in Stories of the Hut - <a href="../../docs/Angelique/dev/angelique_dev.htm">Angelique Marsters</a>. Where this story conflicts with this data - the <a href="../../docs/docs_index.htm#angelique">story</a> takes precedence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For the duration of the Egyptian Empires she played various parts in the ruling structures. She finally went to sleep for a very long time after either the end of the 20th dynasty or the end of Cleopatra 7. She slept until awakened in 1881 by the pillaging of the cache DB320. She lived a few years in Cairo and then moved on to London when several visions drove her there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For <a href="mereret.htm">Mereret</a> the storage crystal count is 22 used. 1 is <a href="hatshepsut.htm">Hatshepsut</a>, 2 is <a href="cleo_7.htm">Cleopatra VII</a>, 3 and 4 are tomb robbers from the last few attempts on the temple, 5 is the cache guard, 6-10 are Cairo denizens, 11-13 are from the ship to London, 14-20 are from around London, 21 is <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a>, and  <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy Wellingham</a> is number 22.</a>. Where this story conflicts with this data - the story takes precedence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her personality is crazy as a fox. She enjoys her unlife and loves experiencing everything she can. This is what has allowed her to live the length of time she has. She has seen a lot, and been effected by some of it. She began life as a seer and the vampyrites and necklace have enhanced this in some little understood way. This has left her with some of the vision capabilities of Drusilla and some of the insanity, however she is not by nature overly vicious. Mostly she is just direct, employing only the amount of effort required by the situation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Remember - she does have the craziness from the visions. This is always a risk when speaking with someone that knew the non-overlay version of an overlaid persona. The visions and the craziness has gotten worse since the time/space anomaly that brought the new Jekyll to London.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These are the various victims of victim 0. These will be purged during her various sleep cycles.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hatshepsut was Mereret's first true love.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption"><a name="polly_t">Polly Tanner</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is the overlay Mereret used on her voyage from Cairo to London. She abandoned this overlay after the first night when it proved unequal to basic survival in the poor sections of London. Polly Tanner was a middle class woman in Cairo. Mereret swiped her passport and sampled her when she was mugged in the Cairo markets. Polly Tanner is used when she goes to the theatre and meets Henry Babbage.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption"><a href="file:///z:/shapes/rebecca_t.htm" name="rebecca_t"><img src="file:///z:/shapes/mere_alt_02a_thm.jpg" border=0> Rebecca Thornton</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is the overlay Mereret uses when removing problem persons from the area of Whitechapel where she lives and works. Rebecca was an Englishwoman who was murdered in Cairo, so she will never be found in London after Mereret shifts back from this overlay.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption"><a href="../../common/npc_images/emily_c.htm" name="emily_c"><img src="../../common/npc_images/emily_c_thm.jpg" border=0> Emily Crooksley</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is the overlay Mereret used the most on her arrival in London. This is a constructed overlay from various samples taken in Cairo and on the voyage to London. This is the overlay that knew Elizabeth Stride, <a href="mary_kelly.htm">Mary Kelly</a>, and others in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields areas of London. Emily is a hardened street person, capable of doing what is necessary to survive in the rough areas of London. This includes pick-pocketing, prostitution, and petty theft. Elizabeth Stride was the woman who rescued the Polly overlay Mereret used on the ship from Cairo. Emily lived with Elizabeth at 32 Flower and Dean St. until Elizabeth moved out in early 1884. Emily continued living there with friends or by herself until she acquired Angelique.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Emily is a plain woman of average height. She is neither stout nor thin and her hair is the generic light brown of many of the populace. She exhibits some of the poise, assurance, and predatory nature of Mereret unless Mereret is consciously trying to suppress it.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption"><a name="ang" href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="mereret.htm">Mereret</a> acquired <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> in 1887 behind the Prince of Whales Theatre when she was killed by thugs hired by her step mother. See <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> for more details about this overlay. She became friends with <a href="dimentia.htm">Charlotte</a> when she returned to the theatre to report a fictional attack as the cause of the death of her suitor. <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> was 21 at the time. From <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a>'s memories she learns of her family's abuses of her. She sets about removing them as well. The Marsters family money is from coal holdings in the Newcastle area. She became the holder of these properties upon the death of the rest of her family.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Illuminating poison</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mereret discovered an illuminating poison during the later years of empire, most likely around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_dynasty_of_Egypt">tenth dynasty</a>. There have been a couple of iterations of the poison, culminating in the stable recipe she used during <a href="cleo_7.htm">Cleopatra</a>'s time. She revised the recipe in London because a couple of items were hard to come by.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Recipe 1</p>

<p class="regtxt12">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium">opium</a><br/>

</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After the extreme use of this in <a href="cleo_7.htm">Cleopatra</a>'s time, Mereret is addicted to this stuff. She will crave it, partly for the visions, but mainly for the raw, bitter, intensity of the flavor and the first blush of activation. It is possible she will struggle with this issue in London. Lestrade will recommend <a href="lienhua.htm">Lien Hua</a> as the best source for alternative herbs and items.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Egyptian Items in London</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mere will frequent the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum, not so much for the accuracy as to be by familiar things. She might slide her way in by showing an aptitude for reading the various scripts, since she knows them all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mere will make use of the Reading Room once she becomes Ange, using the status of the Wellingham's for access.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Story Notes</p>

<p class="regtxt5">need to try and convey Brit. English as a second language to her. she is used to thinking in ancient egyptian</p>

<p class="regtxt5">she will be appalled by the dirt of London - she comes from a culture almost obssessed with cleanliness</p>

<p class="regtxt5">it is becoming apparent that to properly present Angelique - she must be ancient egyptian first, vampyr second and a cultural anomaly whenever possible - she will have the advantage of "overlays" from her probes to help her blend, however the "overlays" are just that - a pattern she can use to try and fit in, but it is still not her natural state or training. she is first and formost an aristocrat from the ancient egyptian courts, consort with royalty, and lover of a pharaoh</p>

<p class="regtxt5">egyptian women were mostly equal to the men of the time - especially true in her case where she was nobility at all times after her acquisition of the necklace</p>

<p class="regtxt5">personality - used to being treated as an equal, used to being defered to by lower ranks, curious and happy most of the time, passionate and uninhibited compared to the repressive and prudish europeans, frustrated by the victorian society she is in, she will thrive more in the Hut, need to keep the visions and the spasms of insanity they can induce - she is not as crackers as Dru for example, she has notions of moderation that seem like intemperance to the victorians, she loves good beer, fine foods, ornamentation, and scents, she deplores the tight, restrictive fashions, the repressive and ego-centrism of a culture she views as inferior to hers, the dirt, grime, and smells of the european cities, she cannot understand how they can be so reluctant to bathe, she takes offense when "egyptian" is used as a poor analogy or derisive comment</p>

<p class="regtxt5">naming of the place: <a href="http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/kmt.htm">Tour Egypt - on Naming Egypt</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Basically, we can examine three groups of names which have applied to Egypt.  In the early period of Egypt, during the Old Kingdom, Egypt was referred to as Kemet (Kermit), or simply Kmt , which means the Black land. They called themselves "remetch en Kermet", which means the "People of the Black Land".  The term refers to the rich soil found in the Nile Valley and Delta.  But it was also sometimes referred to as Deshret, or dshrt , which refers to the "Red Land", or deserts of which Egypt is mostly comprised.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Later, Egyptians referred to their country as "Hwt-ka-Ptah" (Ht-ka-Ptah, or Hout-ak Ptah) , which means "Temple for Ka of Ptah", or more properly, "House of  the Ka of Ptah" Ptah was one of Egypt's earliest Gods. As in modern Egypt, this was both a name for the administrative center of Egypt, what we call Memphis today, as well as the name of the country as a whole.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">look up Mereret on the touregypt site - mention her time in the courts of the Pharaohs where she is listed - this is before the time of Hatshepsut</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hatshepsut is 18th dynasty - maybe this is the last time Angelique is awake for any length of time?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Angelique - pelvic tattoo - maybe from before her turning? or from the time of Hatshepsut, or both? - search on tattooing on TourEgypt for articles indicating popular patterns, images. also search on henna and look at the uses and related items for makeup and perfuming</p>

<p class="regtxt5">sequencing notes: consider everything third person except the Egypt account</p>

<p class="regtxt5">cities:<br/>
        Memphis - Mennufer - capital of Djoser<br/>
        outskirts of Cairo - Iunu, or iwnw, meaning pillar - greek Heliopolis - center of astronomy at time of Djoser, Imhotep</p>

<p class="regtxt5">calendar - New Year starts on the first new moon after Sepdet (Sirius) emerges from its 70 day trip below the horizon, this is also the beginning of the achet(flood) season. flood season is typically end of June to October. peret (growing) lasted until the end of Feb which started schemu (harvest) which lasted until the beginning of the next achet</p>

<p class="regtxt5">remember Ramses II fought several battles with the Sea People - these are the Minoans</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Mereret loves dates, she will insist on getting date palms added to the Hut */

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider name change - Seshet - after the goddess of scribes from early on<br/>
this goddess has a 7 pointed item in her name - could this have come from the item which Iskandera carried?
several sources place Seshat/Nefersheshat from the 2nd dynasty<br/>
this way she could become confused with the goddess of scribes after the fact and tied to the development of hieratic */</p>
