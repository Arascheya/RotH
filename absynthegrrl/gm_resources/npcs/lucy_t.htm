<p class="pagecaption">Alucinia (Lucy) Tomarasdan</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alucinia gives the impression of having always lived in Stratmore Upon Comcrash, however her past is far more than she typically lets on. As a girl she followed <a href="irena_k.htm">Irena Katarya</a>, and her friends, after they came through Stratmore. <a href="irena_k.htm">Irena</a> had suffered a cyberware crash and was in the village for almost two years before she recovered enough to leave. Lucy and <a href="darina_s.htm">Darina</a> both followed along, losing track of <a href="irena_k.htm">Irena</a> when they arrived at <a href="../places/lotus_empire/gana.htm">Gana</a> in the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She didn't see <a href="irena_k.htm">Irena</a> again until the final <a href="../../player_info/hist_hell_gate.htm">Hell Gate Wars</a> battle. By that time Alucinia was commander of the personal forces of the <a href="empress.htm">Empress</a> of the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>. After the <a href="../../player_info/hist_hell_gate.htm">Hell Gate Wars</a> she renounced her command and took to living on the streets, hoping to drink and debauch her memories away. She was saved by Ahkmed from death in a back alley and nursed back to health and sanity by <a href="darina_s.htm">Darina</a> and him.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Irena</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="irena_k.htm">Irena</a> came to the village in a damaged state, capable of very simple, repetitive actions, but not much more. She was taken in by <a href="marissa.htm">Marissa</a>, <a href="darina_s.htm">Darina</a>'s mother, where she was treated as another daughter. The second spring after her arrival she was nearby when crazy old <a href="kaltereth.htm">Serena</a> came into town to trade with a small caravan. <a href="kaltereth.htm">Serena</a> was examining a few old wands when <a href="irena_k.htm">Irena</a> picked one up before anyone thought to stop her. It discharged an electrical trap of some form and knocked <a href="irena_k.htm">Irena</a> down. Once she woke up she began to rapidly heal, progressing through the Tai Chi moves that always were the first sign of cyber brain rebuild and moving on to be fully back by late summer. Once she was back restlessness forced her to begin moving.</p>
