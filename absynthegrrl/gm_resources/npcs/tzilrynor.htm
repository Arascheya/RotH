<p class="pagecaption">Tzilrynor</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tzilrynor was known mostly for his research into soul capture and storing. He created the <a href="../items/souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a> toward that purpose. He had a tower or stronghold somewhere near the Dwarven First Home but it has never been found. It is here that he created <a href="../items/souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tzilrynor was born in the city of Shadizar to a wealthy noble family. He always knew he wanted to be an Arcane so when he reached his age of consent he enrolled in the School at Skelos. He rapidly proved himself and received as much additional training as he could handle. Even then his main interests were in the collecting and cataloging the knowledge and skills of his fellow Arcanes. His changes to the library and other repositories kept large amounts of knowledge from getting lost. However it was still not enough for him. So once he was certified he entered the Well of Skelos to search for knowledge on other worlds. His travels finally brought him to the world of Zeltrop and the rumors of the Ancients and their fantastic lore.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">No matter where he traveled all he found were dim legends and rumors of Ancients being sighted just beyond the next mountains or ocean. Finally his travels led him to the abandoned dwarven First Home. Within the depths he came across a place of great energy, a gate of some type similar to the one he had come through from Skelos. Drawn by the power he built a tower nearby and settled in to continue his researches.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Using the gate below he prowled the multiverse seeking more knowledge. In his travels he began to collect tomes and treatises on storing of energy and essences until he hit upon a perfect plan. He decided to create an item that would harvest and store the knowledge held in living brains. He worked long and hard to bring together all the needed components and begin the creation. His knowledge was flawed and his assembly suspect for in the end he created <a href="../items/souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">His first test of his harvester was on a friend, Marklanus the Fire Mage, who died screaming in agony as <a href="../items/souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a> did its work. Appalled at what he had created he locked it in his tower and journeyed once again to find a way to restore his friend.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He eventually ended up in Centrys where he was killed accidentally in a Faction sanctioned death raid. His name passed into obscurity.</p>
