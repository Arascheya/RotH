<p class="regtxt5">Details:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">was removed from starfleet when empire was formed from old republic and starfleet was purged of older regime people, was     drunkard for a while, now mostly fakes it, had been highly praised officer before purge, now works with the wanderers and survivors</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the older officers were replaced if they questioned in any way the consolidation of power or showed any sign of reluctance in enforcing the new order when <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> seized power.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Will - started as a promising space fleet officer during the alliance days. He quickly rose through the ranks because of a combination of decisiveness, people skills, and good tactical abilities. When <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> rose to power he and several other high ranking officers from the old ways were demoted or forced into retirement. They had attempted to protest the imperialization of the alliance through official channels and then by direct media action. There was some public outcry, but by that time <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> and others had consolidated their hold enough that there was no way to alter the results. He blames her and has not forgiven her the decisions. When he first sees her on <a href="ghostwind.htm">Ghost Wind</a> he signs on with the intention of killing or betraying her at the most opportune moment, as time goes on he sees a side of her that modifies his opinions until he is at least neutral. At first he was just a drunk after leaving, but it didn’t take long until he found out there was an underground that was seeking to oppose her. He whole heartedly threw himself into various venues that opposed her regime, including the smuggling and other counter governmental groups. He has had some dealings with <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> already, when she was involved in a couple of her father’s missions. He is loosely tied to the <a href="../info/talons.htm">Celestial Dragons</a> because their methods are less blood thirsty than most and there is a strong honor premise in the organization.  When he hears about the <a href="../gods/razaks.htm">Razaks</a> he is willing to suspend his quarrel with <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> until he at least has a better feel for the whole situation. When he sees her dedication to taking down the <a href="../gods/razaks.htm">Razaks</a> he is able to finally see another side of her. He shouldn’t completely thaw until close to when <a href="krystal.htm">Krys</a> is rescued.</p>
