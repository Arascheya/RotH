<p class="pagecaption">Stephanos</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stephanos is an unbound <a href="../gods/razaks.htm">Razak</a>, meaning, a <a href="../gods/razaks.htm">Razak</a> that has broken loose from the One-Mind control and become independent. He was sent to Zeltrop to find one of the <a href="../items/ring_onemind.htm">Master Rings</a> after it was lost during the evac of the <a href="../gods/razaks.htm">Razak</a> homeworld. He was not told that the other six had already been destroyed during the Razak Conflicts, concentrating the One-Mind master virus into the final remaining ring.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stephanos arrived a while ago, detecting the Ghost Wind in orbit, but finding it empty. He was sent from the Razak holdings shortly after the destrcution of homeworld. He arrived in Zeltropian space after having been bounced through a space-time distortion near <a href="../places/karanal/karanaldata.htm">Karanal</a>, where he was sent to track from. The rest of his crew died and his ship is damaged, although not as badly as Ghost Wind. His ship can still manage inter-planetary travel and full life-support.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stephanos also has a shuttle available, although fuel supplies are scarce, so he will rarely use it. He has access to parts of the <a href="../info/tubetrains.htm">Tube-Train system</a> from a brief alliance with the <a href="elentaryn.htm">Insane One</a>. He remains neutral toward <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> and <a href="sharyl.htm">Sharyl</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stephanos began to feel tendrils in the back of his mind when Amorama began reviving the Onemind Virus. He has set himself the task of finding the source and neutralizing it. Having found his freedom, he no longer wishes to loose it. This has taken him to a deserted house near Miskaton. He has made this into a base of operations as he begins further investigation. He realizes the actual source is in the next valley over, however, he was nearly shot down by Amorama when he attempted a fly-by.</p>
