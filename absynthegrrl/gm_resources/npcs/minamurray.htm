<p class="pagecaption">Wilhelmina Murray</p>
<p class="regtxt5">b. 8 September 1870</p>


<p class="regtxt5">Mina is the only daughter of Andrew Murray, comptroller of <a href = "../info/ciwl_etc.htm">ITC</a> and one of the founding members of the Keepers of the Doors. She has been friends with <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy Wellingham</a> since they were children. Mina's mother died when she was young and <a href="annewellingham.htm">Anne Wellingham</a> became her second mother. As a result she was exposed to the same schooling as <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy</a>. Andrew hoped his daughter would follow in his footsteps as comptroller, however her apptitude is more toward programming and project management. Once Andrew realized this he pushed her in directions that would strengthen her abilities in these fields.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mina met Jonathan Harker at a <a href = "../info/ciwl_etc.htm">ITC</a> event. Jonathan was working as a junior partner in the law firm retained by <a href = "../info/ciwl_etc.htm">ITC</a> for their legal issues. They are engaged to be married when he returns from Transylvania. Recently Mina has been seeing <a href="princesergei.htm">Prince Sergei</a>, whom she met in downtown London. She is torn between her sense of duty toward Jonathan and her infatuation/deep passion for <a href="princesergei.htm">Prince Sergei</a>.</p>
