<p class="pagecaption">Jose Collins</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Singer, actress</p>
<p class="regtxt5">b. May 23, 1887 (London) - d. Dec. 6, 1958 (London)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her mother was music hall legend <a href="dimentia.htm">Lottie Collins</a> (1865-1910), who popularized "Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay." Jose got her start in music halls, making her West End debut in The Antelope (1908). She found stardom on Broadway, appearing in Vera Violetta (1911), The Merry Countess (1912), and sharing a duet with Jolson, Al in The Whirl of Society (1912). Her revue appearances included the Ziegfeld Follies (1913) and The Passing Show (1914).</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Back in London, the dark haired Collins triumphed as the gypsy girl Theresa in the long-running Maid of the Mountains (1917) -- introducing "Love Will Find a Way" and "A Paradise For Two."  She remained a London favorite for several years, making annual appearances in new roles -- A Southern Maid (1920), Sybil (1921), The Last Waltz (1922), Catherine (1923), Our Nell (1924) and Frasquita (1925). She spent the remainder of her career in revues, variety and non-musical roles.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jose becomes an entertainment favorite. She marries and has two daughters who also go into theatre. A descendant of hers, <a href="rianna.htm">Ariana (Rianna) Timmenson</a> becomes a legend of the video generation at the beginnings of the Mega-Corp ascendency. <a href="rianna.htm">Rianna</a> is an idol of <a href="yraisul.htm">Yasmine Raisul</a>.</p>
