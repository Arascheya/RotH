<p class="pagecaption">River Drake - Called River Arrow for use with Madison</p>
<p class="regtxt5">By necessity, rivers are the roads of the wilderness. Even after civilization extends its grasp, much cargo continues to move on the rivers. The River Drake is a paddle-wheel riverboat that has traveled the Great River for many years, serving commerce amidst persistent rumors of darker motives.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The River Drake is a large river boat that works the ports of the Great River from the sea coast as far inland as Crumbling Skull Rapids, easily moving bulky cargo that is otherwise inconvenient to move by mule, camel, or wagon. Most boatmen avoid cruising the river at night, due to the risks of shifting sandbars, drifting logs. and the possibility of bandits. The River Drake, in contrast, moves at night and stops at the river ports during the days. Many a farmer has been startled to see its large silhouette quietly moving through the river mists in the dark of night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For the few who know what propels the River Drake, its nocturnal habits are more easily explained. Most people have seen the glistening slime trails of garden slugs shining as dawn breaks. Just as those slugs search for food in the cool, moist night, so also do the rare giant slugs of the Darkmist Forest. Eight to 10 feet long, these slimy monsters have never been domesticated; at least not until now. For in fact, they are the living motors of the River Drake. Controlled by old Furth, the slugdrover, they creep along their treadmills for hours each night, powerfully turning the stern paddle-wheel. The slugs are never seen by the residents of the ports, who nonetheless comment on the offensive smells when the River Drake happens to be upwind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Curiously, the boat is not owned by humans (as is most of the river traffic), but by riverfolk, a furry, water-loving, nonhuman race. Though both their features and figures have a faintly human cast to them, their appearance reminds many of otters. Riverfolk usually avoid dealings with humans, due largely to the prejudice shown towards them. In the past, it was not uncommon for rivermen (male riverfolk) and rivergynes (female riverfolk) to be robbed, beaten, and even enslaved by humans. Such incidents are fewer now, since most river folk wisely stay near their settlements in the marshes and distant reaches of the rivers and lakes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Captain of the River Drake is Ristya Darkbrow, an alluring rivergyne very wise in the ways of the Great River, and skilled with both combat and magic. Helping with her tasks are her twin sons, Corinth Lefthand and Calyx Bristleneck. There are eight other members of the crew, including six humans, an adolescent rivergyne, and Occo Fiden, a half-breed human of obscure parentage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The River Drake is a cargo vessel, carrying bulky goods from port to port along the Great River. Many farmers have small docks from which they load their crops on the boat. Since the River Drake moves at night, farmers hang lanterns on the docks to signal they have goods to be shipped. Hides and lumber are also typical cargoes, as are trade goods from the cities to smaller villages. The boat is fairly slow, with its many stops, but shipping rates are reasonably low, so that the cargo hold is nearly full much of the time. The Captain prefers not to carry passengers or livestock, but occasionally will do so when paid an extra fee.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Layout</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The River Drake has four decks. From top to bottom, they are the Bridge Deck, Cabin Deck, Main Deck, and Slug Deck. Below the Slug Deck are the Bilges. From forward aft (front to rear), the ship's three masts are the Foremast, Topmast, and Shortmast. The Topmast actually extends through the Bridge Deck down to the Cabin Deck.

</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ladders(D) on either side of the Cabin Deck are used to reach the Bridge Deck.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bridge Deck</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A. Bridge: This is the highest compartment on the River Drake, and the place with the best visibility. It is surrounded with windows, with a windowed door in the after bulkhead (wall). The Captain steers the River Drake from here, using a large, spoked wooden wheel (C). Although hooked to a complex set of ropes and pulleys, the wheel is not physically connected to a rudder, but is an enchanted object that manipulates water currents to turn the River Drake. Only Bosun Tam and the riverfolk crew know this. By clever use of the wheel, the Captain can make seemingly impossible maneuvers, like slowly moving sideways to the dock.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">B. Dryout: The flat area aft of the Bridge is used to dry ropes and canvas (and sometimes clothes). It is sometimes used for sun-bathing by the crew when they are underway.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cabin Deck</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Four ladders from the Main Deck lead up to hatches in the Cabin Deck. These hatches can be locked from above, but are normally left unlocked.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A. Captain's Cabin: Ristya Darkbrow, Captain of the River Drake, lives in this cabin, which has two windows forward, and windowed doors to either side. The base of the Topmast stands in the center of the cabin.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The cabin is well appointed showing Rystya to be quite wealthy for a river gypsy. A well constructed trunk contains her clothing. A mesh bag hangs from a hook on the Topmast Within, she keeps various fresh fruits and vegetables, used as snacks. The after bulkhead of her cabin is painted with a realistic mural of a marsh. There is a small teak desk that holds her personal log, papers, and the documents necessary for trading on the river.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">B. Corinth's Cabin: His cabin is on the port side (the left, facing forward) of the River Drake, with a windowed door as entry. An orange curtain along the forward bulkhead of his hides his hanging clothes. The aft bulkhead has a mural of a tree in autumn foliage. He hangs his weapons and boots from pegs on the remaining bulkhead. In addition, he keeps an extra dagger concealed within his bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">C. Calyx's Cabin: His cabin, on the starboard side (the right, facing forward) of the Riyer Drake, also has a windowed door as entry. There is an pale green curtain along the forward bulkhead of his cabin, but he keeps nothing behind it. The aft bulkhead has a mural of small shrubs leafing out in the spring. Although there are pegs on the remaining bulkhead, Calyx rarely uses them. lnstead, he just drops his things on the floor. When Mulya sleeps in his cabin, she hangs up his things, but this condition only lasts until the next time Calyx uses them, and subsequently drops them. He is not annoyed by her neatness; it is merely unimportant to him.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">D. Bosun Tarn's Cabin: His cabin is on the port side, aft of Corinth's. Although small and containing many items, the cabin seems roomy due to Tarn's rigid discipline. He has an abundance of built-in drawers and shelves, with their contents always placed exactly the same way. His clothes are tightly rolled and stowed, and every inch of storage is used. The wood in the cabin shines with a rich warmth. Brass hinges and handles sparkle merrily. Intricately knotted ropework is displayed decoratively. A small locker contains rolls of bright ribbons. He sleeps in a hammock, which is carefully put away when not in use.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">E. Bartholomew's Cabin: His cabin is on the starboard side, aftof Calyx's. The cabin is virtually empty - a hammock is stretched between two hooks. and a duffle bag in the corner contains spare clothes. He seems to have nothing else of a personal nature.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">F. Deckhand's Cabin: The largest cabin, with three windows and one windowed door (aft). There are three sets of bunk beds fastened to the bulkheads in the front of the cabin. Each set is a stack of three bunks, so that there are nine sleeping places total in the cabin. Each crewman has a footlocker, stowed either under the lowermost bunk or under a window. In the center of the cabin is a small table with three chairs. Often the deckhands play cards here. The most popular game is called "Gangup," a gambling game for three in which the object seems to be for two players to take all the money of the third. Wilari, Occo, Black William, Irena and Mattie sleep here. The other four bunks are vacant.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">G. Ladders, to Bridge Deck.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">H. Hatches, to Main Deck.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">J. Base of Topmast.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">L. Shortmast.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">M. The cabin section has been extended back into this area and an enclosed galley has been added. There is also a small head and shower that feeds into the waste disposal system that is accessible from the walkway on the starboard side of the ship.</p>

<p>
	<IMG SRC="../../common/npc_images/MainDeck.jpg">
</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Main Deck</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Four ladders from the Main Deck lead up to hatches in the Cabin Deck. These hatches can be locked from above, but are normally left unlocked. Four hatches in the Main Deck lead down to ladders from the Slug Deck. These hatches are normally locked from below, preventing access to the Slug Deck. A fifth large hatch also opens down to the Slug Deck. This allows the slugs and their food to be hauled up and down.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A. Foremast: This mast supports the hoist, used to load and unload cargo. It is also used to raise and lower the skiff.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">B. Hoist mechanism: Used to raise and lower the hoist. This is Occo Fiden's station when at the dock.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">C. Skiff: A small boat, propelled with oars. One person can manage the skiff, although it can carry a sizable load. Wilari usually operates the skiff.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">D. Main Doors: Entry into the Cargo Hold. The doors can open in or out, and one can be kept closed while the other is opened. There is a very small door in one of the main doors, so that a person can enter without unfastening them. Normally the main doors are locked. Ristya and Black William carry the only keys.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">E. Cargo Hold: The large area used to stow cargo. Typical cargoes include agricultural products, leather, trade goods, and sometimes building materials. However, most anything will be carried for the right price.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">F. Outer walkways.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">G. Ladders to Cabin Deck: Hatches at top may be locked from above; normally unlocked.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">H. Hatches to Engineering Deck: Usually kept locked from below.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Engineering Deck</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Access is from four ladders leading down from hatches in the Main Deck. This deck is where the Ancient Magic items provide the motive power for the River Drake. This is an intricate mess of complicated machinery designed to provide motive power, water filtration and conditioning, and basic waste product conversion. Several techs were provided by Milo as part of the conversion of the ship. These techs were relocated from Aztol's holdings when he disappeared.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The primary power system is a hydrogen powered Fusion Reaction Package of the mid range wattage type. This unit could provide aux power sufficient for a shuttle or other small ship. In this application it is running at 25% capacity. Electrical power from this is fed to the drive motor that turns the main wheel. This is controlled by the engine telegraph in the bridge deck wheelhouse. Additional power is fed to the water, waste, loading winch, and sonar detection systems.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The sonar systems primarily determine water depth. They also do basic object and collision detection to prevent another submerged mine from damaging the ship again.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">H. Hatches: These are kept locked at all times with only the engineering team having the keys. No non-ship personel are ever allowed into the engineering spaces. It is possible that a PC with good sense of smell might detect oil or similar scents coming up near the hatches inside the main cargo bay. The larger forward hatches are used when equipment replacement is required. Usually removing spent FRP fuel packages and replacing them with fresh ones. This procedure usually occurs twice each year. Milo will bring the Ghost Ship to Tzell and the swap will take place in a cove across from the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bilges</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The bilges are dark, confining, awash with water and oil floating darkly over the ballast. The bilges have become far less dangerous now that the newer propulsion system has replaced the old slugs, turntables, and pulleys propulsion system.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Access to the bilges is through the bilge grates found for and aft of the FRP. The hoses can be hooked up to pump out the bilges, when they become too wet.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Corinth and Calyx are the twin sons of Ristya Darkbrow. Although quite similar in physical appearance, their dress is usually quite distinct. Corinth favoring oranges and reds. A typical outfit of his is a pair of mottled orange trousers topped by a tight-fitting rust jersey.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Corinth's favored weapons are longsword and dagger, which he can use equally well in either hand. He wears the sword on the right and the dagger on the left, drawing them cross-handed.</p>

He normally wears brightly-colored loose trousers and an open leather vest, but neither headgear nor shoes. His torso flaunts numerous tattoos, the most dramatic being a scene of a river monster pulling a man under the water. There are no tattoos on his arms or face.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Tam insists on all the boat gear being exactly and neatly in its place. A sure way to provoke his anger is to cause a mess on deck. Every line is always stowed properly, even decoratively. The brightwork gleams and is free of finger marks. The wood of the skiff shines with fresh varnish. There are brilliant ribbons trailing from the shortmast, in new color combinations each morning.</p>
