<p class="pagecaption">Lady Ayrthane - Dorotea Ayrthane</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Wizard Lord of Formanought. At the time of the Magic War she had been in Formanought researching the Artifact found and brought to her home city. She believes the Artifact to be one of the Shadow Orbs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lady A is similar to Black Company Lady - hard as nails, competent, honorable in her own way, and very much in charge. She is ruthless but fair, cold but compasionate and has the wellfare of her citizenry in mind with every decision she makes with regard to her domain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sister of <a href="tonie_a.htm">Tonie Ayrthane</a> and aunt to <a href=nadya_a.htm>Nadya Ayrthane</a>. She does not resort to magic or trickery to keep the populace in line and will release anyone from her service if they truly desire it. This has made her extremely unpopular with the rest of the wizard lords.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="antonius_s.htm">Lord Shalmar</a> in particular wants to destroy Lady A and absorb her domain into his own.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lady A will be drawn to the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/machine.htm">Machine Ruins</a> instances of the Hut when players finish the Hovelton adventure. In the case of <a href="sophia_n.htm">Sophia</a>, she was already at the Hut location when <a href="sophia_n.htm">Sophia</a> emerged.</p>
