<p class="pagecaption">Aristandilus Raisul</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aristandilus was the chief guardian of the original Sultan of Kharatoum. This is the Sultan that took the various loosely allied tribes of the Kharatoum area and welded them into a cohesive political unit. Aristandilus was his right hand during this. Having no heirs of his own the Sultan declared Aristandilus his heir apparent.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aristandilus went on to solidify the Sultanate and set the stage for it's growth into the polictical entity it was by the time of <a href="k_sultan.htm">Ibrahim bin Raisul</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aristandilus was also an associate of <a href="margla.htm">Margla</a>. She created the <a href="../items/bracers.htm">Bracers of the Assassin</a> for him. He used these as the final strike weapon in several major disputes early in the Sultanate's history. In exchange for these items he was to guide the Sultanate in ways that <a href="margla.htm">Margla</a> desired.</p>
