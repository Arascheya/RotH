<p class="pagecaption">Maranda - Aztol's girlfriend before he went crazy</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ideas: mother and sale as sacrifice, lover of Aztol (for a while),</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Personality: sweet, caring, wants to be an artist, does not like what Aztol has become and was left by him when he fled</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Appearance: light brown skin; blue eyes; 5’7"; curved horns birthmark under and up sides of left breast; light build</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Stats: str-10;int-12;wis-12;dex-10;con-12;char-18</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Notes:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She was the daughter of the proprietress of the Cozy Cove Baths in Altaarkrn. Her mother went off the deep end on the death of Maranda’s father. She pledged all her wealth and her allegiance to the death cult that was forming in the area. She gave Maranda to the cult when she found out Maranda wanted to be an artist at one of the temples instead of continuing to help her run the bath house. She was confined with the slaves when she tried to leave until she could be passed on to the cult.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her mother never remembers the right description of her daughter’s friend/lover, nor the correct date of when Maranda ran off with him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aztol came in once when Maranda was working and took a liking to her. Over the next few weeks they became close. When her mother saw what was happening she gave the daughter to the death cult and told Aztol she had drown the night before. This was early in Aztol's life, before he became as weird as he is now.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She was rescued and went to live with Aztol at his base of operations. She watched him become more and more obsessed with the world gates and the cobra book. Then she was there when he was forced to rescue the party he sent out and watched his madness grow after that. Shandi was tortured while she was there. When Aztol fled with Kaltereth, she was left behind.</p>
