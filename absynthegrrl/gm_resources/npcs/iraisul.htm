<p class="regtxt5">Physical Description:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Ibrahim is a large, jolly man. He is the stereotypic Middle Eastern restaraunteer, polite, jolly, and friendly to anyone who enters his shop. He is in his late fifties yet is easily mistaken for late thirties. He has an easy charming way that makes him extremely easy to like and trust.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Personality:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">He has learned to use his outward personality to his advantage in sizing up people in his restaurant. Underneath his warm exterior is a very good judge of character. He was as much of a parent to Yasmin as her mother, more after she returned from Chiba City. He convinced her not to give up on her mom on many occasions when she grew angry at getting no support.</p>
