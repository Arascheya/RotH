<p class="pagecaption">Nyssa ni Raisul - Ghost Ship - Tears of Kharatoum</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Captain - Milo Nimbletoes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Nyssa ni Raisul, one of the twin daughters of <a href="k_sultan.htm">Ibrahim bin Raisul</a>, the ruling sultan of Kharatoum, was kidnapped and ceremonially sacrificed to the sea god, her blood was used in the caulking of a ship, and her spirit was ritually bound to it by the arch-mage Nyigroth.  A figurehead, carved to look exactly like her, was fixed to the ship and the ship given to the sheik on his daughter's birthday.  He was so overcome with grief that he cut his throat and bled to death on the deck of the ship.  After this the ship's crew would sometimes see a vague shimmering form prowling the decks by moonlight and softly moaning.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Many years later a young captain fell in love with the ship and bought it.  He cleaned it thoroughly, repainted areas that were starting to show wear and, after a particularly successful trading run, commissioned a gold bikini set to be fashioned around the figurehead.  About this time a beautiful woman began to appear in his dreams.  She was six foot tall with black hair and golden skin, wearing a gold bikini set, exactly like the set fashioned for the figurehead, with dark blue gauze harem pants and light blue sleeves.  In his dreams they always ended up making love.  The young captain began to awaken even more refreshed than normal and the ship seemed to respond more readily to her helm.  His trade routes prospered and grew and sailors from all the lands began to fight for a chance to join his crew.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After a time he began to see the woman of his dreams wandering the ship at night when the crew had bedded down.  She always appeared where only the captain could see her and again they always ended up making love.  The apparition seemed to become a little more solid each time until after several years she became visible to everyone.  The captain introduced her as his lady and she shared his cabin.  Over the years he bought her many fine things and in time began to forget where she had come from.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Then disaster struck.  A band of pirates attacked the ship one day, when she was far away from protected shipping areas, and seized her.  They killed the captain and his crew, cut the figurehead off after stripping the gold from it, and erased the name.  When they went to take their pleasure from the woman things began to go wrong.  The leader reached for her and staggered back his hands grey with frost and frozen solid.  When the crew attempted to cut her down their swords passed right through her.  Those closest to the rail jumped and swam for their ship.  Any who looked back saw their friend's shriveled, frozen bodies being hurled into the sea.  Shortly after this the ship came floating into a harbor during a fierce storm.  There was no sign of a crew.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A wealthy merchant bought the ship at auction and supplied a new crew.  Two nights out from land a beautiful dark haired lady appeared in the captain's dreams and indicated she wanted to make love to him.  Even in his dreams the captain felt fear and so he refused.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The next night the same thing happened, again the captain refused.  After two weeks of this the night stillness was broken by the sound of moaning echoing through the passages of the ship.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Two weeks after the moaning started the captain dreamed he was making love to the woman he had seen.  The next morning he awoke feeling weak and shaken.  These dreams persisted for several weeks until one night the captain awoke in the middle of the dream to find the apparition astride him.  He reached up to try and push it away and felt the flesh of his hands freeze solid.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When the cabin boy came into the captain's room the next morning he found the captain huddled in the corner whimpering piteously and cradling his blackened, frost bitten hands.  Nothing anyone could do seemed to help the captain's state so the crew set a course for the nearest harbor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The ghost then appeared to the entire crew for the remainder of the voyage to harbor.  When the ship tied up the dock workers were surprised to see the entire ships company flee headlong into the nearest tavern, leaving the ship deserted.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The merchant finally found a crew of felons to sail his ship to another port and abandon it.  Again the ship sailed into a port without a crew.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Since that time the ship has had many owners.  Some, with better luck than others, could put up with it for times of up to two years.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Several women tried to captain the ship.  All of them were found raving mad after only a day or two.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">One owner tried to have the ship torn apart but he and his family were so badly haunted that he had the ship rebuilt.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Several exorcisms and procedures for laying ghosts to rest have been tried but to no avail.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The owner before Milo has had the ship for two years and has survived by never spending a night on the ship.  He was impressed by the fact the ship has had no need of repair even after running over a reef.  The ship also has been known to find a safe harbor even through the fiercest storm.  However the ghost is beginning to call to him at night now and he wanted desperately to sell the ship.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Just when he was about to despair Milo came along and offered to take the ship from him. Somehow Milo and the ghost have come to an understanding. The ghost is once again beginning to solidify to the crew. The current crew has now owned the ship for almost twenty years. The beautiful woman that walks the decks is believed to have signed on at a far port. Only the crew know she is the solidified ghost. The name given for her is Nyssa Far-Traveller. </p>
