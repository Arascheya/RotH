<p class="regtxt5">Ida Walsh was a nurse at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenox_Hill_Hospital">Central Hospital</a> in Yew Nork. She was very popular with staff and patients because she was cheerful, caring and competent. She was killed when the excavation for the expansion on the corner of Park and 77 collapsed. The collapse killed three construction workers, Ida,and several pedestrians.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her ghost remains at the hospital. She is often seen wandering around Trauma 3 and the nearby wards.</p>
