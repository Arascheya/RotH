<p class="pagecaption">Roxy Faust</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy is a <a href="../monsters/demons/demon_succubus.htm">succubus</a>. She comes from a long line, descended from <a href="iskandera.htm">Arascheya Iskandera</a>. Her family wanted to explore another Realm in the multi-verse and relocated to the Evacuees World. Roxy is in complete control of her special nature and finds ways to feed on the "free range rude" as she likes to say. It is a line from a movie she saw when she was younger. It was one of those movies that might not have been appropriate for her, but it did little damage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her mother works in the Medical Examiner's office. She has the ability to read data from the auras of the dead. The fresher the dead, the more complete the readings. This allows her to nudge the police in the right direction.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She rides a large black motorcycle, use either a <a href="../../common/item_images/vincent_black_lightning.jpg">Vincent Black Lightning 1952</a> or a <a href="../../common/item_images/triumph-thunderbird-09.jpg">Triumph Thunderbird Storm</a>. This is the "concealed" form of the <a href="../items/hellhog.htm">Hell Hog</a> she rides. It was a gift from her grandmother when she came of age as a succubus. Succubi come of age when they hit their form of puberty, around age fourteen years.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy was in Yew Nork and visited the Museum of Natural History when a Zeltaaran exhibit was on display. It will take her a while to recognize the symbols in the book as the ones she saw there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy met Dan and Lara in middle school. Their second year, they were alone in Dan's basement and decided to play you show me yours, I'll show you mine. After the initial discomfort of the nudity, Lenny haltingly confessed his inner most trouble, the desire to not be a boy. Roxy responded by sharing her secret. During the summer between middle school and high school they had their first time as lovers. This formed the triad they have been since.</p>
