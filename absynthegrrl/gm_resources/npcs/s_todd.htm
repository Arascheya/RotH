<p class="pagecaption">Sweeny Todd (Benjamin Barker)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Barber on Fleet St., shop is called Sweeny Todd's Tonsorial Emporium. His shop and apartments are above <a href="s_lovett.htm">Mrs. Lovett</a>'s on Fleet Street. He is a sour, bitter man, angry from mistreatment by a judge who lusted after his wife. Todd was sent into exile when he was still Benjamin Barker and his wife was raped and killed. His daughter is a prisoner of the judge, however, he has not yet managed to free her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the time of the <a href="../../hut_online/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a> in London, he has not yet begun his murderous activities. In this time line he might not. If her were to become friends with <a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> he could have her solve the problem without resorting to violence himself.</p>
