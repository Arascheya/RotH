<p class="pagecaption">NPC Ghunayyasara (Nayya)</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Current Version</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nayya was born in a clan of Ocean Wanderers. She was a normal girl until her clan ship was attacked by slavers when she was fifteen. She and several other children were taken, the adults slain, and the ship fired. She was cruelly used by the crew until her mind snapped when she was eighteen. She became a cold killer, carefully plotting and them killing the entire crew of the slaver. She disappeared into the swamps to heal from the wounds suffered during the attacks. There she came across the hut where <a href="shareya.htm">Shareya</a> was living with her grandmother.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There were more children at first. The boys were sold off and the girls were kept to service the crew. They slowly died off from injuries and from despair, until only Nayya remained. She managed to escape and kill all of her captors, however, she was pregnant from the constant assualts by that time. She took care of the child, but has regrets and uncertainties about what she did from the upbringing of her people.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ocean Wnderers live mostly on their ships. They trade among the islands in the area of sea similar to the Carribean. In this world there are more islands crowding the sea between the various land masses forming the boundaries. The East Oceanic Trade Company considers the Wanderers to be competition and vermin. They slay the adults, capture the children for the slave trade, and fire their boats whenever they find one in a vulnerable position.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Personality: what's in it for me? However she does have the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a> sense of honor and will honor contracts and agreements she enters into. She will accept Letters of Mark or other contracts that specify a specific target if it suits her interests or if the reward is high enough. She has a sense of clan and other, from her childhood, and this applies to the crew of her ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is a pirate working the Crowded Sea below the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>. <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> gifted her with <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a>'s old holdings in the Crowded Sea once he fled. The main building is similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Palace">Summer Palace</a>. Use it for ideas and place as the end of one of the island arms. She shifted her alliances to <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> after <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> went off the edge. She Also has ties to <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> although she honors her ties to <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> more. She forms a pipe-line of information and resources to <a href="ghostship.htm">Milo/Ghost Ship</a> and to the agents scattered around the <a href="../places/val_exp/val_exp_inx.htm">Valley of Experiment</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is aware of <a href="kalyana.htm">Kalyana/Shade</a> as a new pirate force working from the east and spreading into the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a> waters. The battle barge has curtailed her actions toward the east. She is now concentrating on the Crowded Sea area.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="lisette.htm">Lisette</a>, her other closest friend, has taken over the Thieves Guild in the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>. The guild houses in several major Lotus Empire cities are connected with the entrances to the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern of Dark Delights</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Adventurers in the know will use the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern</a> as a short cut between the linked cities. The staff of the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern</a> will not reveal this. It is up to the adventurers to figure it out on their own. Also, the portals will only return an adventurer to the place or places they have already been.</p>
