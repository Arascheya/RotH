<p class="pagecaption">Jemima - R17 Character</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jemima is taller, 6' or just under, slim, again athletic but not
over-muscled, she has a "gentler" face with rounder features, deep brown eyes, and dark curly hair, which she tends to keep shorter.  In traditional fantasy parlance, <a href="sammi.htm">Sammi</a> looks like the daughter of a high lord or grand duke, Jemima looks more like the daughter of a yeoman farmer or blacksmith.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">One of the interesting things about them is that it's Jemima who thinks more like the aristocrat, while <a href="sammi.htm">Sammi</a> is mentally 100% engineer. This confuses and confounds people who don't know them, especially people who try to manipulate of take advantage of them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Individually they both tend to run into trouble, especially <a href="sammi.htm">Sammi</a> who still has a lot of issues from her past to deal with, but together they are totally unstoppable.</p>
