<p class="pagecaption">M'Ardett - First Mate</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mardett is the only member of the crew that believes the Temple about how the universe and magic work. He has made it his mission to convert that captain, although he has never turned her in for any of the heresies she states. He knows of the captain's background and tolerates her dismissal of the dominant religious thought.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He is extremely loyal to the captain and the Antigone. Much as he dispises the captain's heresies, he will not turn against her. In this, he embodies the best of his religious thought, the ability to love the non-believer, even through the difficulty of the non-belief.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The world around him gives him the strength of his belief. He does not always hold with the intracacies of Temple thought, but would never think that "god" does not exist. As the adventures unfold, his faith becomes stronger as his trust of the temple fades.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He is in love with the captain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Endgame for M'Ardett is a very deep faith while being labeled heretic by the temple because of what he learns.</p>
