<p class="regtxt5">Profession/Title:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">owner/ operator, Coffee Messiah, coffee shop</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Physical Description:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Tall, large boned of mixed Caucasian and Moroccan descent. His features are a cross between handsome and pretty.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Personality:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">He is kind of a flake in many ways, preaching personal responsibility while showing little of his own for example. If it weren’t for his business manager and head barista the Messiah would have gone down long ago. He is charming and friendly though, so he does most of the PR stuff and leaves the harder tasks like rousting the chippers to his employees. In return the business manager sees they get paid well. He has joined forces with Ibrahim next door to contract for quiet security to keep the disturbances down in their businesses.</p>
