<p class="pagecaption">The Shade - Kalyana ni Raizul</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Kalyana is one of the twin daughters of the <a href="k_sultan.htm">Ibrahim bin Raisul</a>, Sultan of Kharatoum. She was called to the mystic arts early in her life and devoted most of her time and energy into following their path. The court magicians tutored her and found her an apt pupil. Her grasp of the principles was sure: by the time Princess Kalyana had attained her sixteenth birthday, she had surpassed her teachers in power. Her father asked his old friend <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a> to instruct her further. He agreed and began at once. During her tutelage they bound the Lizard Kings-/*MODIFY this to fit a bastardized version of the Geomancers from Al-Qadim Ruined Kingdoms*/. Also during this time <a href="nyigroth.htm">Nyigroth</a> became aware of the artifact <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a> used in the imprisonment and sought to grab it for himself.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="nyigroth.htm">Nyigroth</a> bided his time, waiting until <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a> was away and then he struck. He captured Kalyana and bound her to servitude in his palace by separating her soul from her body. Her body he kept bound into a globe of invulnerability. Her soul he bound to himself through the use of his magic. Next he killed her twin and bound her soul into one of her father’s new ships. He presented it to the Sultan on her birthday when he demanded the surrender of the artifact. Overcome by grief the Sultan killed himself on the ship by cutting his own throat. Not understanding the situation on the ship the Sultan’s retainers cut it loose and left it to drift down river to the sea. It avoided destruction through the magic that bound Nyssa’s spirit to it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="nyigroth.htm">Nyigroth</a> flew into a rage as the secret died with the Sultan. He returned to his palace and through various magics learned of one who had knowledge of the artifact and of the crystals. While he was casting his spells and searching for information <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a> returned to <a href="../places/akhalt/akhalt.htm">Akhalt</a> and learned of the events. Immediately he set out to confront <a href="nyigroth.htm">Nyigroth</a>. They met in a titanic battle of magic that shredded the very air around them. When the destruction cleared there was no sign of either mage. <a href="nyigroth.htm">Nyigroth</a>’s palace was in ruins and the damage to the structure of the earth under them resulted in the formation of the <a href="../places/galhaiwaste.htm">Great Wastes</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is one who searched hardest for Kalyana. His name was <a href="minstrel.htm">Danilithor Tyazen</a> and he was a minstrel in her father’s court. He fell in love with her and worshipped her from afar. He searched in vain for her all the days of his life, finally vowing he would not rest until she was found. At his death his spirit rose to continue the quest. He has been restlessly moving about the continent since then, always seeking Kalyana. For a time now he has been residing at the Grey Minstrel Inn, resting and hoping to over hear a clue to allow his search to begin again.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Arcanes of all skill levels flocked to the area hoping to find pieces of magic and items that weren’t destroyed in the cataclysm. One of these located and removed the urn to which Kalyana was bound. He used her as his personal slave, servant, and research assistant.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For years the Kalyana was under the control of the arcane who had found her vessel until she was able to bend his will to her desires. She used her new servant long enough to indenture three demons of the third pale to her service, gathered together the more potent of his supernatural tools, and departed into the night after turning his soul over to the demons as payment.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The magics that bound her soul, stabilized her body, and later freed her have left her soul seperated from her body. Her body remains in stasis deep within her fortress while her soul roams in the guise of an ebony shadow. Her shadow form is corporeal enough to carry weapons, wear clothing, and take apparent damage.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her first discovery was that her powers were limited by sunlight. Any spell she cast during daylight hours could send her senses to oblivion. She would wake up hours later, always lying beside her inanimate body. Some of the less powerful spells could be cast during the day, but the more powerful the spell the more likely she was to pass out.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The affliction is triggered by the sun. At any time between dawn and dusk, there is a 5% chance per power point used by the Kalyana that she will discorporate. (Note that the Kalyana does not have to be exposed to sun light. The affliction is a function of the sun being above the horizon). For example, if the Kalyana casts a 20th level spell during daylight hours, she will automatically suffer the effects described. (20 power points expended X 5% = 100%. The spell is still cast and the effects applied afterward). If the bracelet adder (see section 7.3) is used to cast a spell, the chance of the Kalyana discorporating is reduced by half i.e. the Kalyana casts a 12th level spell during the day. She employs the adder to cast the spell. That would be 12 power points expended X 5% = 60%. The adder reduces the 60% by half, or 30%.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">If the Kalyana does discorporate, her "shadow" body, robes, and all other items she is carrying will simply disappear. She will slowly reappear next to her true body on the bier in her tower. For a period of 10 to 12 hours, the apparition will lie helpless. At the end of that time, she will rise with no ill effects.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">If the Kalyana is met in physical battle and defeated, her shadow body will likewise discorporate. When this happens, however, the robes, ring, talisman, etc. are left behind. For 48 hours the Kalyana's shadow body must rest before it can return to the fight. Aside from the loss of the magic items, there is no harmful effect of this process. If it appears that the battle is going against the Kalyana, she might elect to throw a spell she knows will cause her to discorporate. She has since reserved her spell-casting to the night, unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The body of the Kalyana is that of a beautiful woman; although she is actually more than four hundred years old, her apparent age is between twenty-four and thirty years old. She is of slight build (5' 4" tall and 125 lbs. in weight). Her black hair is worn long and loose.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Kalyana's delving finally led her to the possible cure for her affliction. She can be freed, and healed of mind, but only through the use of the Bowl of Purity and the magic rituals of the worshippers of Ertan. She searches now for the details of the procedure. Her release requires the presence of her <a href="ghostship.htm">sister</a>, the one bound into the ship, and it must be performed at sea under the full of both moons. She has searched for her <a href="ghostship.htm">sister</a> using every bit of magic available to her, yet it is as if a veil has been cast over her. Something interferes with everything she has tried. At best she can determine that her <a href="ghostship.htm">sister</a>’s soul has not been destroyed. She uses her raids on shipping to finance acquisition of more magic and to pay adventurers to continue the search. She has been acquiring magic items with the intent to barter them for information on her sister and the artifacts she needs to free herself.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her current strategy has been to use a band of pirates to speed the acquisitions. They have been active in the eastern Crowded Sea but now are starting to  move into the westerns sections. Kalyana and <a href="ghunayya.htm">Ghunayya</a> have been negotiating over rights to various sections of the sea and islands.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Kalyana possesses few powerful magic items. The reason for this relative dearth is tied to her fascination for the original journals of ancient spell casters (see Kalyana's Keep Level II, room #4). Magic items she obtained have been largely traded for her collection of books.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The hostage value of these books, especially those in the "D" rack of the Kalyana's library cannot be discounted. Next to guarding her body, the Kalyana will take whatever steps necessary to safeguard her books. lf the party happens to capture the books from the library, they can use them to keep the Kalyana from blasting them indiscriminately. The Kalyana has retained the following items:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">1.*  A pair of shimmering blue robes that give protection as type 12 armor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">2.*  An amulet that gives control over sea birds.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">3.*  A ring that calms the surface of the sea over an area of one mile radius.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">4.*  A bracelet that acts as a +4 spell adder.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">5.*  The Keep of <a href="teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a>, a "portable" fortress.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">6.*  The staff of Shadow Halls, charged with the spell "Fire Bolt".</p>
<p class="regtxt5">7.*  Cross Breed Jewels. These call forth a protective beast upon being tossed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">8.*  Booster Potion that enhances the fighting ability of the imbiber.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">9.+  Bronze Battle Barge. A toy of the arch-priest Eridor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To crew the barge and garrison the keep, the Kalyana has recruited a force from the city of Garrothold. This city has traditionally been a haven for the outcast of society. Some 500 of these thugs have answered her call to arms in exchange for a generous split of the spoils.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The fighting ability of these men is augmented by a potion administered just prior to battle, which increases the offensive bonus of the fighter by 30%. In addition, those under the influence of the potion are not subject to the results of critical hits that do not result in immediate death (i.e. a critical that stated that the victim was incapacitated due to shock or a stunning blow is not implemented). However, additional hits are deducted and if the wound is stated to cause death at a later round, the victim will die at that time. A side affect of the potion is that there is a 10% chance that the person using it will slip into an irreversible coma. These warm bodies are given to the demon that supplies the potion as payment. The pirates don't seem overly concerned with this. They generally regard it as a fantastic joke on the person afflicted. It also increases their personal share. The potion takes effect in one minute and lasts for three hours. The coma occurs as the drug wears out. More details are available in the new magic section, 7.3.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">/* Story ideas and notes */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">need to shift a bit more away from the Shade concept when writing the story of the defeat of the Hand</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider: change the references and maybe remove the fortress and battle barge descriptions based on The Shade, modify the battle platform to be more of a ship and the fortress can morph into something not quite so magical but more protected by her abilities. her raids are to gather money to hunt for her sister and the way to free herself.</p>
