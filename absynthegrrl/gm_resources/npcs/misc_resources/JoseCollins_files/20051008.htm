'Anna Held Out of the Cast.<br>
'Her Manager Tells of a Misunderstanding with Mr. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Hammerstein_I">Hammerstein</a>.<br>
'Miss Anna Held is no longer in the cast of <a href="http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=13623"><i>La Poupee</i></a>
at Hammerstein's Lyric Theatre, and her manager, F. Ziegfeld, says it
is because of a misunderstanding between himself and Mr. Hammerstein.<br>
'The theatre proprietor says Miss Held was physically unable to do the
rôle justice and therefore ordered the understudy [Louise Hoppner] to
be ready to go on for the performance. Mr. Hammerstein says he is under
no financial obligations to Mr. Ziegfeld.<br>
'Francis Wilson telegraphed Mr. Hammerstein from Syracuse, making him an offer for the opera.'<br>
(<i>The New York Times</i>, New York, Monday, 1 November 1897, p.16d)<br><br>
'Koster &amp; Bial's.<br>
'Tonight ANNA HELD. Marie Lloyd. Faust Ballet. Alice Atherton and foreign stars. Adm. 50c. Matinee Saturday.'<br>
(<i>The New York Times</i>, New York, Tuesday, 9 November 1897, p.12g, advertisement)<br><br>
'The number of actors and actresses who spin along the bridle paths in
Central Park every morning offers undreamed of possibilities to the
keen-eyed press agent, and it is strange that up to date this fact has
not been taken advantage of. Maxine Elliott and her sister Gertrude are
among the number of equestriennes who never fail to take a canter when
the morning is fine, and Anna Held, whose milk baths and similar press
agent stories won columns of free reading notices not so long since, is
another.<br>
'Now that the milk-bath story has died out, an exciting runaway would
prove a sensational story, or a double hit could be made if Nat
Goodwin, who rides every day, could play the rôle of the daring
rescuer. Marie Lloyd is another of the footlight celebrities who finds
equestrianism a delightful form of exercise.'<br>

'Speaking of mimicry, there is Belle Blanche, for example, who imitates
players grave and gay with entire credit to the performers. Miss
Blanche's talent, while not entirely mimetic, has been largely
developed in the line of impersonation and although nature has endowed
her with voice and personality sufficient to win success in the
legitimate field or in musical comedy, the broadening of her gifts as a
mimetic and her success have tended to keep her in this line. She has a
most extensive repertoire from which she may cull without premeditation
the lights and shadows that reflect other great artists.&gt;br&gt;
'She is so versatile that her impersonations run the gamut of all the
emotions and in quick succession she shows us flashes from the serious
and the frivolous in dramatic art, from the highly emotional roles of
Bernhardt to the entirely humorous and somewhat frivolous ditties of
Harry Lauder, with the gradations of histrionic art well marked between
her study of David Warfield in <a href="http://www.ibdb.com/show.asp?ID=6354"><i>The Music Master</i></a>
has been accounted the best impersonation of that serious actor that
the American stage has had. So, too, her mimicry of the Lloyd sisters,
Alice and Marie, the English comediennes; of Eddie Foy, the American
buffoon; of Mrs. Pat Campbell, the English emotional actress; of Ethel
Barrymore, Maud Adams and a score of others. Miss Blanche's voice
possesses the quality of flexibility in a rare degree and she has a
mobility of countenance that adapts itself readily to each of her
characterizations. Whether you see her as a musical hall [sic] favorite
or a queen of the tragic drama, you see her at her best.'<br>

'Crossing [the Atlantic from London] with the <a href="http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=7167"><i>Our Miss Gibbs</i></a>
company was a liberal education in how to acquire cheerfulness under
homeskickness. Fred Wright, the comedian, displayed a photograph of
curly haired, three-year-old Fred Wright, Jr., who hugged the paternal
leg and begged "papa not to go on the ship and leave me."<br>
'When the memory became too poignant Mr. Wright seized some member of
the English company, pulling him or her bodily out of the deck chair,
and marching the thirteen laps around the ship's deck that made a mile.<br>
'Beautiful Molly Lowell, pulling the corner of her steamer hood over
her eyes when the image of the daughter with whom she had parted at
Southampton was too insistent, started the American song, "John Brown."<br>
'Gordon Kent, like Miss Lowell (his "first time over"), kept down the
lump in his throat by practising love songs in his sweet, lyric tenor
in the saloon every afternoon at three. Ethel Cadman, coming back for
her second season in <a href="http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=7090"><i>The Arcadians</i></a>
after a nine days' visit to her English home, assured them: "American
isn't so bad, you know. You may quite like it. I do." Clever Jean
Aylwin retold every Scotch joke she knew to prop up her sinking spirits.<br>
'Little Julia James, the youngest cone of the company, who came from
school at Margate to the stage of London three years ago, following
Denise Orme when that stage beauty forsook the musical comedy stage for
matrimony, and who is to sing "Bedtime at the Zoo," cheered herself and
combated seasickness with Scandinavian philosophy.'<br>

'In addition to Jose Collins, whom Lew Fields has engaged for the title-role in <i>Suzi</i>,
the new operetta from the Hungarian, others in the cast will be Connie
Ediss, Robert Evitt [i.e. Robert Evett], an English tenor; Lew Hearn, <a href="http://www.nodanw.com/shows_h/hulloragtime.htm">who has been at the London Hippodrome</a>
for two years; Fritzi von Busing, Melville Stewart, Alexander Clark,
Arthur Lipson, Howard Benham, Betty Lee, and Doris La France, a dancer

'Miss Collins as Star.<br>
'Mme. [Emma] Trentini, the noted grand opera singer, will give her most ambitious operetta in <a href="http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=8155"><i>The Peasant Girl</i></a>
in Philadelphia next week and Jose Collins, one of the most remarkable
of the light opera artists, will make her initial appearance in that
city as a star at the same time. Mme. Trentini will open her engagement
at the Lyric Christmas Eve. Miss Collins will begin a limited
engagement at the Adelphi in the new light opera, <i>Suzi</i>, Monday
evening [21 December 1914]. A coincidence in connection with the
appearances of these stars, is that each will be supported by famous
characters. Clifton Crawford, of <a href="http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=6560"><i>Three Twin</i></a>
fame, will supply the principal comedy foil for Trentini, while Tom
McNaughton, the English comedian, will cavort before the footlights for
comedy reasons with Miss Collins.'<br>
