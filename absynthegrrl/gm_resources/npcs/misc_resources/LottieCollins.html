<p align="left"><b><b> <b> <font size="3">Lottie Collins was born into
the theatrical profession in London in 1866. She began as a skipping
rope dancer in 1877 before being joined by her two sisters, Lizzie and
Marie in a music hall act. In 1886 she made her first appearance at the
Gaiety Theatre, London, in the burlesque <i>Monte Cristo Junior</i>
(23 December), with Nellie Farren, Fay Templeton and Fred Leslie in the
principal roles. Afterwards she devoted herself to the variety stage,
and in 1891 she toured the United States. While there she heard the
song 'Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay' with which she returned to London and which
will forever be associated with her name. On the strength of her
success with this extraordinary song and dance at the Tivoli Music Hall
(first performed there on 7 November 1891), Miss Collins was engaged
once more for the Gaiety Theatre, appearing in a cameo role in the
burlesque <i>Cinder-Ellen Up to Late</i>.<br><br>
During the remainder of the 1890s Lottie Collins toured the United
Kingdom music hall circuits with a series of song and dance sketches,
the most popular of which was 'The Little Widow.' The memory of
'Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay,' however, overshadowed the rest of her career.<br><br>
Her third and last husband was James W. Tate (1875-1922) whose own work
on the music hall stage included appearing with his then wife, the
singer Clarice Mayne (d.1966), who will be remembered for songs such as
'I Was a Good Little Girl Till I Met You' and 'Joshua (Sweeter Than
Lemon Squash, You Are).' Tate, also a composer and conductor, was
responsible for additional music for the musical comedy <i>The Maid of the Mountains</i>,
which between 1916 and 1920 ran for 1,352 performances at Daly's
Theatre, London, with Lottie Collins's eldest daughter, José
(1887-1958) in the lead.

<p align="left"><b> <b> <font size="3"> '&#8230; And can anyone who saw him
forget Hebert Campbell's excursion into the domesticities - Campbell,
reputed to weigh nineteen stone [266 pounds], who was faithful to
elastic-sided boots because stooping to untie laces was out of the
question - when, dressed as a woman, he denounced the bicycling craze
[of the 1890s] and the then "new woman"?&#8230;<br>
'But the "new woman" was already a life-force, and it was Lottie
Collins who had made of a music-hall song a sign, a portent, and a
paean of liberation.<br>
'The actual song itself was little or nothing, the tune was catchy, the
singer was everything. Lottie Collins turned "Ta-ra-ra-boom-deay" into
a Dionysian revel of the emancipated girl.<br>
'In the imagination one sees and hears her now, singing, almost nervously, with Victorian diffidence, the opening verse:
</font></b></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><b> <b> <font size="3">
A smart and stylish girl you see<br>
Belle of good society;<br>
Fond of fun as fond can be - <br>
When it's on the strict Q.T.<br>
I'm not too young and not too old,<br>
Not too hot and not too cold,<br>
But the very thing I'm told,<br>
That in your arms you'd like to hold
</font></b></b></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><b><b> <b> <font size="3">
 'A tiny pause. A crash from the orchestra. The mask dropped; the insensate chorus burst forth:
</font></b></b></b></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><b><b><b> <b> <font size="3"> 
Ta-ra-ra-BOOM-deay
</font></b></b></b></b></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><b><b><b><b> <b> <font size="3"> 'It was a Pavlova's
"Bacchanale" of the [music] halls, ante-dating the Russians by a
generation. One remembers even now the electric thrill which shot
through the audience, as a species of frenzy seemed to possess the
slight figure on the stage, and the tempestuous petticoats swished, and
the scarlet-clad limbs flashed high in the air.'<br>
(J.B. Booth, <i>The Days We Knew</i>, T. Werner Laurie Ltd, London, 1943, p.46)
