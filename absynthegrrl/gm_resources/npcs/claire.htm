<p class="pagecaption">Claire</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Claire is about 5'3" tall with black hair and hazel eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire works at Temple Heath and sometimes visits the <a href="../places/eternia/devilscathouse.htm">Devil's Cathouse</a>. She is small and slight. Her jobs are mostly engineering drawings, planning, and logistics. Sometimes she feels invaluable and sometimes she feels valueless. It all depends on how involved she is that particular day. Claire does the lighting effects and sound for <a href="loves_bitch.htm">Love's Bitch</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire forms a mild crush on <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> once she sees how she dances and her confident and in control mannerisms. What Claire fails to recognize is that <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a>'s attitudes are sometimes just shells over her own insecurities.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire is shy and retiring outside the <a href="../places/eternia/devilscathouse.htm">Cathouse</a>. Inside the <a href="../places/eternia/devilscathouse.htm">Cathouse</a> she is a different person. She has begun to show more confidence and personality as she has become comfortable in the scene. She enjoys the Temple Heath work but she shines at the club.</p>
