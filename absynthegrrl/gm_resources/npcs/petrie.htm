<p class="regtxt5">John Petrie (b. 1854)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">John Petrie is a doctor, working at London Hospital. He is a close friend of <a href="lestrade.htm">Geoffrey Lestrade</a> and they are often seen together. John is the author of the <a href="holmes.htm">Sherlock Holmes</a> stories, writing under the psuedonym Aurther Conan Doyle. In this time-line, there is no actual Aurther Conan Doyle. He is also kept on call by Scotland Yard for coroner(medical examiner) duties and is considered the best. He is always called for the strange or high profile cases.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By 1889 he has grown a bit tired of writing only Sherlock Holmes and embarks on a new series about an ancient queen from the New East, named Nefersheshet. <a href="mereret.htm">Mere</a> stumbles on the start of his second manuscript and questions him about this. This is when she learns he writes the Holmes stories as well, for amusement and to help fund the surgery.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">John Petrie is married to <a href="lienhua.htm">Lien Hua</a>, a woman of Chinese descent he met at the hospital. <a href="lienhua.htm">Lien Hua</a> is a key player in a health initiative for women and children in the Chinese community, particularly the residents of the Limehouse area. <a href="lienhua.htm">Lien Hua</a> is a source of information for Lestrade when the yard gets called in to Limehouse events. They live near the Wapping Stairs and the Prospect of Whitby pub.</p>
