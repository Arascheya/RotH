<p class="pagecaption">Anastasia Romanov</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia will not directly state her last name. She is the real deal though, having arrived in Eternia after dying in the basement with her family. She was 17 at the time of her death. She has since aged to a physical age of around twenty-five. Emotionally she is much older having been in Eternia now for a very long time. She is one who will take part in many rescue missions because she gets bored hanging around Eternia and likes the challenges of the missions more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="dimentia.htm">Dementia</a> will have known her for quite some time. Need to determine if Dementia recruited her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia was in charge of the Extraction Teams before the arrival of <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a>. She was good at it but miserable. She was haunted by the risks and the fact she was the one placing herself and others in harm's way. It wasn't too bad for her at first, when things hadn't escalated too far. As the proxy forces became bolder and meaner she found it harder and harder until she locked up on one of the missions <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> was assisting with. When <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> pulled it all together she knew she could turn it over to  <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a>. Anastasia remains as an advisor and <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_org_chart.htm">Extraction Teams</a> member because she believes in the need and knows she has skills to contribute.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia lives above the Death City <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!1m8!1m3!1d3!2d1.297222!3d52.631912!2m2!1f876.6!2f90!4f75!2m9!1e1!2m4!1s1MTu8TA44wRFFl5hAK2wFQ!2e0!9m1!6sElm+Hill!5m2!1s1MTu8TA44wRFFl5hAK2wFQ!2e0&fid=5">gothic wear shop</a>,which is the yellow building in the street view. Her living space is entered through the door closest to the Coffee and Tea shop. She is one of the designers of the clothes in the shop and helps out when she isn't on an Extraction. <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> will meet her at the shop when she is out shopping with <a href="claire.htm">Claire</a>. Anastasia had been designing fetish wear based on the designs of the late 1800s and early 1900s before the <a href="../places/eternia/devilscathouse.htm">Devil's Cathouse</a> opened.</p>
