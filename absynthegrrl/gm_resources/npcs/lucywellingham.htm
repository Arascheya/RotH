<p class="pagecaption">Lucy Wellingham</p>

<p class="regtxt5">b. 24 July 1870</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lucy is a study in contrasts. As a senior programmer at ICM she is hard working and brilliant. Yet outside work she comes across as a typical distracted socialite. Arthur has seen some of this, although he is secretly plotting to remove her from the "degradation" of work once they marry.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She and <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a> have been close since childhood, sharing everything except men friends. They are both bi and have experimented with each other a few times. <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a> is torn over the new beau in Lucy's life, on one hand he seems much more capable of appreciating her brains, yet he is an unknown factor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="angelique.htm">Angelique</a> has been a childhood friend of Lucy and <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a> for many years. She will strengthen this friendship once <a href="mereret.htm">Mereret</a> becomes her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lucy will inherit <a href = "../info/ciwl_etc.htm">ITC</a> from <a href="lordwillem.htm">Willem</a>. Currently there are no male heirs. She has no problems with this. In preparation for this she is training with Andrew Murray in the concepts of business. She will ask <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a> to assist her as <a href="minamurray.htm">Mina</a> is more capable as a manager of people.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lucy had chosen Arther Holmwood from the list of suitors including Jack Seward, Quincy Adams (an American), and Arthur. Now she is
rethinking her decision since she has met <a href="borusa.htm">Henry Jekyll</a>. <a href="borusa.htm">Jekyll</a> treats her as an adult and intelligent individual. Where Arthur secretly envisions her settling down and becoming his wife and mother of their children, <a href="borusa.htm">Jekyll</a> sees her as becoming a partner in his affairs. How this will play out once the TARDIS is fixed is anyone's guess.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Remember to have the laws start changing to protect women's assets in marriage and the like. In <a href="ennui.htm">Ennui</a>'s Realm, the laws would be probelmatic for Lucy and Mina to retain any sort of control if they married and held ownership of <a href = "../info/ciwl_etc.htm">ITC</a> interests. <a href="ennui.htm">Ennui</a>'s Realm laws are summarized a bit in the 1880s folder under Info and in any Victorian London data available on the web. Alternate 1880's laws are under development in the Alt. 1880s folder under Info. See <a href="../../hut_valen/madtown003.htm">Hut Starting Conditions</a> for links to various relevant resources.</p>
