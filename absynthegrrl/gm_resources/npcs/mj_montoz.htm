<p class="pagecaption">Maluhia Jessica Montoz</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MJ (Maluhia Jessica) was born on Ohua, Wahaii, to an ex-surfer, turned CFO of <a href="../info/wihane_holdings.htm">Wihane Holdings</a>, and a surfing instructor father. Her mother could trace her ancestry back to the original Wahaiians. MJ started to surf as soon as she could grab a small board. MJ is 5'4" tall, with deep brown eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MJ attended Wahaiian immersion schools for the entirety of her education. She speaks Wahaiian as fluently as the language of the Meriksas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MJ met <a href="nyissana.htm">Nyissana</a> when she moved in with her aunt and uncle when MJ was ten. They became instant friends. MJ and her mother taught Nyissana to surf. Nyissana and MJ came up through competions together. Nyis was the better surfer, however, her injuries reduced her stamina. As a result they would trade wins back and forth in many of their competitions. Neither were overly competitve outside the events, othe trades never effectedtheir relationship. Although, they weren't above teasing others with mock fights and tantrums.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MJ continued to compete after Nyis slowed down and stopped because of her injuries. MJ was sponsored by various surf product lines. While most of the women were more interested in the parties and places, MJ paid attention to the business models and corporate strategies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She started a line of clothing out of her mom's surf school location at the Royal Wahaiian. She called it Gracie Sport Gear after her grandmother Grace. Her designs caught the eye of local girls and younger tourists alike. Soon she was employing friends to help keep up with demand. See <a href="../info/gracie_co.htm">Gracie</a> for more details.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She remains in contact with Nyissana and they are still best friends. Sometimes she consults with Nyissana if she isn't sure about a design.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MJ is a switch foot surfer, meaning she can lead with either foot. She prefers long boards, but is adequate on short boards.</p>
