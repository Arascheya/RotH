<p class="pagecaption">Robert Travers - Watcher's Council</p>
<p class="regtxt5">age: 28</p>
<p class="regtxt5">occupation: Watcher</p>
<p class="regtxt5">personality: a bit adventurous, a bit of a loner. believes the council and the slayer should work in more of a partnership rather than an authority/worker way. finds Van Helsing to be an insufferable bore.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Imagine a character mid way between Giles and an English butler when playing this character.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">info:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Drusilla - sired and rendered insane by Angelus about 80 years ago. about 70 years ago she killed Angelus - a serious infraction in vampyr social structures.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Angelus - particularly nasty and cruel vampyr sired in Ireland about 120 years ago</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Van Helsing - senior Watcher and the Watcher of Princess Maria, the currently acting slayer. Tends toward arrogance and hubris. Believes himself to be one of the final authorities on just about everything. He supports the group of watchers that feel the slayer should be subservient to the council of watchers. Absolutely incensed that a woman, Lady Valen, dared to tell him off and about medical things on which he fancies himself an expert.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">notes for Joel:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">1895 London in an alternate universe. Slayers are real, Dracula exists and is named Prince Sergei Dracul. he is one of the good guys. Sherlock Holmes also exists and has had dealings with the party.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Drusilla is similar to Drusilla from season 2 Buffy. She is a bit more sane since Spike doesn't exist in this time line, so she has had to manage her own survival.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I don't remember if Quentin Travers of the Watcher's Council has appeared yet - he might not show up until one of the later seasons, but Robert is a distant ancestor. If this one interests you he could be used as a sometimes character.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">additional info:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The first two sections are what you arrived to tell them. The details section is additional info you can provide if they ask about it. You can also ask me if you know that since these simple notes won't cover anywhere near the full scope.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Van Helsing was found murdered last night. His neck was broken and there was a wooden stake thrust into his heart. He was found a few block away from the British Museum early this morning by a shop keeper arriving to open his shop. An investigation is underway but there are no results yet.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You can also paraphrase this part - this was written as a reminder to myself. "Seems I was somewhat wrong with the previous research. The necklace has been around much longer, which explains how it was found in the Imhotep collections by Drusilla. It actually dates to the time of Imhotep, as does the anklet your friend is wearing. The information we have is scattered and confused but it implies there was some sort of odd magic around the creation or finding of these items. I haven't been able to find anything about what the anklet does, if anything though. The necklace is mentioned in at least one of Imhotep's texts as far as I can tell. I would need access to the actual text at the museum to be certain. So far that access is limited to senior members of the council."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The first two sections are what you arrived to tell them. The details section is additional info you can provide if they ask about it. You can also ask me if you know that since these simple notes won't cover anywhere near the full scope.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Notes:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Van Helsing was supposed to attend the Museum Gala last night but begged off for some special errands.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He was found between the river and the museum.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are signs of a brief struggle nearby.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Van Helsing advocated the council providing no more information or contact with you.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Maria has been informed of Van Helsing’s death.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Princess Maria of Roumania looks like an identical younger version of Valen, one of the main NPCs. The two have met and you have met both. Your interactions with Valen have been to slip past the council and give her information she really seems to need. As the saying always goes, "in spite of yourself you like her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They are medium height and build, dark haired, with intense grey eyes set in angular faces.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Maria is young and enthusiastic. She still has a bit of the softness of youth, although her training as a slayer has rendered her quite capable in situations she understands.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen is more hard and direct and more angular than Maria. She is used to power and wields it like a finely honed scalpel. She is also brash, outspoken and critical of a culture she has no understanding of. It has become apparent that she was in charge where she came from and she has a certain power within the group you are dealing with.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The characters sometimes refer to something called ‘The Hut’. They have not been very forth coming on this subject.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is another one to take note of. Shandi appears to be a mentally retarded young woman yet everyone in the player group is slightly afraid of her. She is sometimes referred to as their ‘ultimate weapon’.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The people you have interacted with the most are:</p>
<p class="regtxt9"><a href="../npcs/valen.htm">Christina Valen</a> (NPC)</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Morton Thock (Pete’s character)</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Richard Heron (Sean’s character)</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Henry Jones (aka Verkal, aka Hunter - Hunter’s character)</p>
<p class="regtxt9"><a href="../npcs/shandi.htm">Shandi</a> (NPC)</p>
<p class="regtxt9"><a href="../npcs/lordwillem.htm">Lord Willem Wellingham</a> - Owner and CEO of Compaigne International de Wagon Lits, and a major Babbage Engine manufacturing and programming conglomerate (NPC)</p>
<p class="regtxt9"><a href="../npcs/princesergei.htm">Prince Sergei Dracul</a> - vampyr and friend of Princess Maria from the ‘old country’ (NPC).</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Notes: in all cases any pictures with an NPC listing are for concept creation only. I sometimes need an idea of how i want someone to look. The rarely look identical to the trigger pictures<G>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="travers_notes.htm">Additional Notes</a> - brings Travers up to date with current party events.</p>
