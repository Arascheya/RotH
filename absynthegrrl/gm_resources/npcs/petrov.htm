<p class="pagecaption">Mikhail Petrov</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Loud, obnoxious, and mouthy. Petrov is a giant of a man, easily standing 6'4" and body builder solid. He has a good heart if you can get through the bluster and manage to become one of his friends. He can keep his head in a crisis even if people are dying around him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once he and <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> smash heads a few times they grudgingly admire each other. <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> doesn't usually hold with the male beat them up then become friends model, but she does see glimmers of Petrov's good side and it gives her a way to connect. She promotes him to second once <a href="anastasia.htm">Anastasia</a> and he lock horns in a really bad situation. It is enough to make <a href="anastasia.htm">Anastasia</a> quit and recommend Petrov because of how he handled himself in the crisis.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Throughout the extractions, Kali and Petrov become quite close. By the end, they could have been lovers if situations had been different. Or, maybe, they did become lovers. Could go either way here - there are things about him that really appeal to her as time goes on.</p>
