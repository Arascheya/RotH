<p class="regtxt5">Starts in <a href="../../common/place_images/wow_durotar.htm">Durotar</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is an orc rogue and assassin. She started life as a thief, finding stealing easier than up front fighting. She likes stealing, killing, drinking and fucking. She falls in love with women, but will fuck men for the thrill of it. She also is on the blood-thirsty side. Blood will enhance her arousal. Her presonality is a mix of sociopathic and warm. She is charming and loving to her friends and completely neutral to everyone else. Anyone who is not her friend can easily become another target.</p>
