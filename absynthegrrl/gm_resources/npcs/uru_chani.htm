<p class="sectioncaption">Original Data</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Chani is of Czechoslovakia decent. She is older, mid to late 60s.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After death of Herbert Kodetova, her husband, she wandered the old places, seeking to connect with anything spiritual. Slowly, she became convinced she was a speaker for the dead</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Chani can be found wandering around the caverns, confused, and asking those she comes across about the dead.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her personality is a bit like the Blind Preacher of Arakeen, and have her posit the Burial Place, Place of Trauma discussion In Cavern on Live. When she is not wandering the city or ages, she will often be found sitting in one of the egg chambers in the hood, meditating. Irena could first encounter her there while exploring the hood.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">questions to ask: (remember, she doesn't care if she is considered crazy or ignored, her purpose is to sow this concept and see what happens...think new age mystic from hell for POV - and strongly in the Yeesha camp WRT Bahro, etc.)</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I can hear them screaming. (she will be convinced that the Bahro are not responsible for all the screams heard)
what happened to the dead?</p>
<p class="regtxt9">did the DRC or anyone try to put their souls to rest?</p>
<p class="regtxt9">are things being handled in a way that respects the dead and their legacy?</p>
<p class="regtxt9">where is Herbert? I can't find him anywhere... (in less lucid moments)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">see if it stirs up anything</p>
