<p class="pagecaption">Zroteyla - Troll - Hunter - Horde</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Starts in <a href="../../common/place_images/wow_durotar.htm">Durotar</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider altering - Zro is orphaned by the ongoing wars and has been raised mostly by Kijara and Tegashi. They have a bio-daughter, a bit younger than Zro, this is Kaz - Tegashi's father is the liason to the orc village */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* See <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Timeline_%28unofficial%29">WoW basic timeline</a> to determine when early events in her life occur. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zroteyla was <a href="wow_klahraka.htm">Klahraka</a>'s fuck buddy and friend growing up. She s a life loving, warm, generous, and fun person, who enjoys fine foods, good drink, excellent ganj, and making friends. She tries to see the good in everyone. She would have fallen in love with <a href="wow_klahraka.htm">Klahra</a> if she hadn't been so cold and blood-thirsty.  She is in love with <a href="wow_klahraka.htm">Klahraka</a>, but won't admit it because Klahra is such a cold, hard person. She would have stayed in the valley and lived out her days with her family except she was worried when <a href="wow_klahraka.htm">Klahra</a> just up and left. She asked Gornek about her friend, but he wouldn't tell her anything. Zro is pretty sure <a href="wow_klahraka.htm">Klahra</a> didn't like herself or her looks. Zro is proud of her looks, keeping her tusks well polished, her hair just right, her clothes in good order, and herself clean.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zro likes making things from cloth and leather.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zro likes sex with boys, girls, or both, it doesn't matter that much to her as long as it's enthusiastic and rough and tumble. She tends to fall in love with girls and views boys as pleasant distractions. Tegashi was her first man. Klahra was her first woman and Kijara was her second.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zro and her mom are very close. She has always been able to talk over everything with her mom. When she started to bleed, her mom explained Moon Blood as a contraceptive. Before that, she taught Zro to be true to herself, stand up for what she believed was right, and lessons in how to defend herself against unwanted attention or if those trying to coerce her into things wouldn't accept no as an answer. Her mom never warmed up to Klahra, but never will say "I told you so" to Zro. Her mom really likes Klahra's parents. She wouldn't mind grandchildren, but has no desire to force her wants on her children. Zro is currently ambivalent about children, but hasn't ruled out the idea for later in life.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Has a younger sister, <a href="wow_kazbyrttok.htm">Kazbyrttok</a> and a cousin, <a href="wow_tazeyla.htm">Tazeyla</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Troll culture is quite relaxed about sex. Children are seen as a village commitment, with everyone helping with the raising.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The ganj is a troll rite and also a common part of their culture. Being slightly stoned is not viewed as bad unless it is in a situation that endangers self or others. Alcohol is viewed less favorably since it tends to make the drinker mean and beligerent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Professions - Mining and Skinning</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ukor points her toward Razor Hill, saw Klahra, naked, headed that way - Innkeeper Grosk in Razor Hill also remembers Klahra, she came in and a Blood Elf approached her, they left together</p>
