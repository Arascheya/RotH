<p class="pagecaption">Lara March</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara started out Lenny until she was 18. She was disowned when she came out to her parents. <a href="dan_fredricks.htm">Dan</a>'s parents took her in, helped her become an emancipated minor, and helped pay for the changes she needed. She was Dan's best friend, and has been since first grade, and now is his lover besides.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan's younger sister made some comment to Dan and Lenny when they were in second grade about "weiner glasses" for male anatomy - this brought Lenny's issues to his mind and they festered there until she could take action in high school.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara's family will have nothing to do with her, including turning most relatives away from her. There is one lesbian aunt, on the east coast, that will still talk to her. The rest of the family is very traditional and very religious, in the born-again, creepy, judgmental kind of way. Use the Christian radio station lines on her, from her brother, if they fit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her aunt lives in Yew Nork, in a building not far from where <a href="kilashandra.htm">Shan</a> lives. She is mid-forties now and lives with her partner of many years. She had to adjust to the idea of trans people, Lara was the first one she really knew, but she has adapted well. Lara and Dan have visited at least once.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara will be the most sensitive to the Veil. She has always been a bit fei, escaping into books and fantasy to endure her home-life. This ledher into her own mind and down to the shattered core,the burned out city-scape with the huddled, burned figure that is her soul-image. In that wreckage she found the Core of Being. She can see the interconnections between the various planes and sheets of the multi-verse, seeing it in a three plus dimensional construct. For her, the visions are triggered by being near the Hell Gate. Once she passes through it, she has a more complete understanding, including the understanding that she can mold herself by her will. As she learns where the various gates are on the world,she can use them to get from place to place,becoming her own gate controller.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara and Dan are avid gamers and are following the Realms of the Hut development almost as closely as <a href="talia_a.gtm">Talia</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><!-- /* Lara's fantasy is to have been a true hermaphrodite with both types of genetalia rather than having to choose one set over the other */ --></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Lenny was a scared, timid, tortured child, Lara is ethereal, with a hidden strength. Like the wind, she doesn't seem like much until she reaches epic levels, then she is devastating. Shortly after her change three jocks ambushed her outside of school. Lara was bloody, tattered,  and in severe shock by the time she was found, but the jocks were curled up on themselves, damaged to the point of requiring institutionalization because they could no longer care for themselves. Lara had used the Core of Being to loop their worst actions back on themselves, magnified ten-fold, but, because she didn't know what she was doing, she made the loop permanent. Lara was released because no one could figure out how she could have destroyed the three. They hadn't quite raped her by the time she took them down. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Lara remembers doing something to them, but has no remorse for stopping them. Exposure to the Hell Gate will restore her memories of what she did, but there will be no remorse. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Lara is anti-religion, use my early life experiences for her - distant parents who had children because it was expected - religious and expecting Lara to be, she is critical, bitter, and angry at the way the society around her doesn't work, will tell someone that she had times where she wished her parents would have aborted her, can warm up to kids, doesn't want any of her own, considers having children to be extremely cruel and selfish, consider half memory of something creepy happening when she was young - she's never certain if it really happened, so mentions it to no one (would have to be an inside her head POV or she would have to break silence for this to come out) - Dan would be the only one she might tell */</p>
