<p class="pagecaption">Alisha</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Alisha is <a href="anastasia.htm">Anastasia</a>'s second in command when <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> starts with the extraction team. Alisha is a control freak. She wants things done an exact way and by the rules and guidelines that have been set up as the team has worked together. She is quite good as a second because of this and the attention to detail that comes with. This becomes more and more a liability though as the unrest of the broken Truce begins to grow. Once the "good" side joins in the battles Alisha begins to lose it. She can't understand how the "good" side could be involved.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Alisha resigns when <a href="kali.htm">Kali</a> takes over the lead of the extraction team. She goes to work for the sorting and recovery distributions center in Death City. Once again her attention to rules and detail serve her well and she is much happier there.</p>
