<p class="pagecaption">Nyissana "Nyissa" "Scar" Kaikelani Zarev Finley</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alt. Earth - Rani Corp</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissana is 5'6" tall, dark brown hair with reddish high-light, and violet eyes. Her eyes can film over with a curious film when she is distracted or ignoring unpleasantness. She has black tribal style tattoos mirrored on her upper arms and shoulders and on her hips and thighs. She also has an ornate piece in the center of her chest. Irena and Jaime have the same chest piece in honor of their friendship. She has a scar starting above her left eye, crossing the bridge of her nose, and ending just before the edge of her right eye. She also has massive scaring on her right arm and hand. There are scars around her right knee, right hip, and right shoulder from repairs from the car accident she was in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was born Susanna Zarev, in a small town in Klohama, Meriksas Allegiance. She was athletic, participating in the swim teamand volleyball in school. She grew up sheltered by her parents and the community, until her parents were killed in the car crash, that gave her all her injuries, when she was ten. Her mom was trying to teach her Wahaiian as she grew up, however, it was hard because they were the only two speakers on Klohama.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa was the only survivor of the crash. It left her broken up, requiring months of surgeries and physical therapy to repair her right arm and hand, right knee, and shoulder. The injuries trouble her when she is tired or when the air is cold and damp. She is stiff and awkward on land, but is fluid and graceful on a surf board. Her right arm and hand don't work very well, causing her trouble in phys ed in school and requiring her to use a single hand keyboard for computers. She had to learn to write and do many things left handed after the accident. Her right hand tends to relax into a claw-like shape from the shortened tendons left after surgeries. The more stressed she is, the more claw-like her hand. Irena will joke that it is her 'stress tell'.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa could be considered handicapped because of the loss of function in her right hand and arm ndthe stiffness she experiences in her right leg and hip. She doesn't consider herself so, having learned to compensate by switching main duties to her left hand. Physical activities requiring dexterity in both hands are beyond her, so that is the only place where she feels disadvantaged. She started using accessibility tools after the accident, a right hand control glove for mouse actions and a single hand keyboard for writing. At first she only had access to specialty components from an accessibility company and they were pretty clunky looking. When she went to her first game con, after starting at CyCore, she saw Talia with her jewelry-like hand sensor, took the idea, and ran with it. Her new "glove" is a masterpiece of gothic jewelry with seriously upgraded sensors. She swapped the old one handed keyboard for a sleek, new one with better key layout and a much smaller footprint.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"> At the base of her throat is a crescent scar with three small bumps in it. Each bump contains a bead placed in the incision made at her acceptance into womanhood ceremony. The left bead is for her mother, the right bead is for the woman of the tribe standing for her, and the center bead is one she wore from the time of her first blood until her acceptance. A mix of ash and other ingredients is added to the wound to make sure it results in a raised scar. Her bead was given to her by MJ as a gift of friendship when they won first and second places in their first surf competition.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her Uncle Charles Finley and his wife Makani took her in, adopted her, and took her to the North Shore of Ohua, Wahaii, where she finished school. Nyis changed her name to Nyissana Zarev Finley as part of the adoption process. Nyissa loved Wahaii, although the crowding and tourist nature of Ohua were oppressive some days. It took her a while to work up the courage to appear on the beach with all her scars.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her aunt and uncle home schooled her, to get her ready so she could go to middle school with the children her age. She had to sort through being a half huala the first years in school. MJ helped with her acceptance, by accepting her first. The other children showed the usual cruelty, refering to her as scar-face or scar. It took her a while, but she learned to accept it and roll with it enough to defuse most of the ugliness. Once she demonstrated she could kick ass surfing, she became one of the cool kids and scar became her surfing handle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa's mom was full blooded Wahaiian, like her sister, Makani. Her father was Eastern European with one quarter T'zani blood. Nyissa got the best of both in terms of her features. The concepts above represent variants to draw from for descriptions. Nyissana speaks Wahaiian, Meriksan, and Ukrainian fluently.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyis attended Wahaiian immersion schools with MJ. She speaks Wahaiian fluenty. MJ, Nyis, and Kai spoke it almost exclusively when they were together. They remain fluent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Makani worked hard to get Nyis past the self consciousness of her scars. She would tell her, "Own yourself" and "the scars are your badge of survival, it's ok to own them". Nyis had a good figure, was athletic, and took to surfing like she was born to it, after Makani and MJ talked her into trying it. She was able to start when she was twelve. The surfing gave her confidence. She knew she looked good on the board and she could hold her own against the best, men or women. It gave her the confidence to walk down the beach without worrying about her scars.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyis met Maluhia Jessica Montoz, MJ, when she moved to Ohua. MJ and her family lived next door to Aunt Makani and Uncle Chuck. Bob Montoz worked for Chuck at his law office in Lanahua. Nyis and Mary Jane became instant best friends. MJ was another surfer and they came up through the ranks together, competing in many local events as they became proficient. MJ went on to compete at international levels and founded <a href="../info/gracie_co.htm">Gracie Sport Gear</a>. They remained in touch even after Nyis moved away for university. Nyis competed using the name Nyissa Zarev.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When she was 15, Makani was at the beach watching her compete. When Nyis was done, she did the following: she had Nyis look at several stereotypic beautiful beach babes and asked, "What do you see?"<br/>
NYIS: beautiful babes walking the beach<br/>
MAKANI: Look closer, what else do you see?<br/>
NYIS: women trying too hard to look good (after she had watched how they posed in every movement, constantly aware of how others were looking at them)<br/>
MAKANI: Look at the other surfers (pointing to some of the older surfer girl competitors who were laughing, carrying on with each other and not paying attention to how others looked at them) What do you see?<br/>
NYIS: Confident, beautiful women, even though they aren't as 'perfect' as the first ones<br/>
MAKANI: Which group would you want to be in?<br/>
NYIS: The second.<br/>
MAKANI: And the boys you'd want to be with would also. Now, let me tell you something, when you are surfing or with other surfers, you are in the second group. You relax, you smile and laugh, and your real beauty shines. When you are alone, you become self conscious and start to fall in on yourself. Try and remember how you are when you are safe with your friends and use that to keep you going when you are alone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Nyis was 16 Makani came into her room after Nyis had a rough day at school. "I know your scars make you self conscious, even now. I also know you are tired of my telling you they are your badges of survival. If you would like, I will sign off on letting you get tattoos to decrease their visibility." Nyis began getting tattooed shortly after, working out an integrated theme for her right arm, leg, and her back. There were negative responses from some people, but far more positive ones, and Nyis found she didn't mind people staring at her tats after all the years of people staring at her scars. She added Wahaiian traditional art to her left arm and leg as a celebration of acceptance by the locals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyis competed heavily through high school, winning many local events. She stopped competing when she realized her knee and hip wouldn't be able to take the continuous strain if she were to try and go fully pro. She still surfs when she visits Chuck and Makani or when she's at a game convention on the west coast. The joy of focus and stillness she got from surfing was her main motivation. Competition was an excuse to keep surfing. When she isn't surfing, she uses the gym equipment at CyCore to keep in shape. It helps with the  migraines and stiffness in her right knee, hip, arm, and shoulder.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When it was time to choose a college, she chose the school she had been thinking of attending before her parents died. She regretted moving away from Uncle Chuck and Aunt Makani, the surf, and her friends. She went for her second love, games, taking computer courses to get the programming skills needed. The school was located in Cagocha, where she lives now.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In her past she has bartended, mixing stiff drinks and sometimes getting fired for it, tried working as a barissta and not doing well at it, before she was hired by CyCore Games after a summer internship during her junior year.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She rooms with <a href="uru_irena.htm">Irena</a>, in a place they have kept since they were both working at Waverly's Pub. Nyissa met <a href="uru_irena.htm">Irena</a> in several shared undergrad classes and they became close friends almost immediately, moving to an apartment above Waverly's once they had completed their first year.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa and Irena are sometimes lovers. Nyissa likes boys somewhat less than girls, while Irena likes both. Irena was the first person to really make Nyissa feel pretty. They sometimes share lovers or rely on each other when they don't have anyone external. Over the years the external lovers have dropped and they spend more and more of their time as a couple.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider - fixing up old <a href="../../common/item_images/uru_shan_spyder.jpg">sporty car</a>, because, while she doesn't really care all that much about driving, she doesn't want to not drive because of fear. She will tell those close to her that the spyder was a therapy car. Now she takes it to the local track and does laps, striving to improve her skill and her time. She has raced it, but rarely places and never higher than second. As she tells it, "I don't have the fire. I like going fast, trying to push myself, but I don't care if I win or not. It's just about improving my skill and keeping the fear at bay." She removed the convertible top, added a hardened roll-cage, fabricated a fiberglass cowling for racing, toughened the suspension, tweaked the engine to the max, added a racing transmission and clutch, and refitted all the brakes. She bought it in poor shape and spent months working on it. She tested the roll-cage by rolling the car on her fourth time out on the track. She walked away because of the cage, but had to spend several more months rebuilding the car. She would have stopped driving if Ted hadn't forced her into his car, after making sure she was ok, and made her do several more laps. She loves to go fast, but doesn't car about the racing part.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyis is a goofy foor surfer, leads with right foot.She prefers short baords, but is adequate on long boards. She surfs even the largest and most dangerous waves on a custom short board she had made by a Wahaiian local board maker.</p>
