<p class="pagecaption">She Who Must Never Be Named - The Lady of Centrys</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Also known as <a href="cene_i.htm">Cenefalys Irashmi</a> in the <a href="../../docs/docs_index.htm#gaming">Gamer Tales</a> section of the <a href="../../hut_irena/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She Who Must Never Be Named, the Lady of Centrys, is a shadow figure, lurking in the background, keeping the city safe and functioning. No one knows what the Lady looks like. None who have beheld her have lived to tell the tale of her appearance. Any who oppose her are either found turned inside out or locked in mini-planar mazes from which escape is well-nigh impossible. It is said she wanders the streets of Centrys, keeping an eye on her domain from the shadows. She has no palace, no throne room, no visible sign of power, yet let any threaten the existence of Centrys and Her wrath is swift and final.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She... is the manifestation of the physical forms of the <a href="../info/multiverse.htm">multi-verse</a>. She... is one of the <a href="../gods/younger_gods.htm">Triad of Younger Gods</a> that took over after the imprisonment of the <a href="../gods_inx.htm">Old Gods</a>, the <a href="../gods_inx.htm">Ones Who Came Before</a>. Her appearance to the other two <a href="../gods/younger_gods.htm">Powers</a> is as a <a href="cene_i.htm">tall, pale skinned woman</a> of average beauty.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was a friend of <a href="margla.htm">Margla</a>, befriending her after the disaster which bound <a href="margla.htm">Margla</a>, the Consumer, and her together. She knows of <a href="irena_k.htm">Valen</a>'s past and will actively seek to communicate with her. When they talk she will gift <a href="irena_k.htm">Valen</a> with an awakening to her full past. She will also give her a memory crystal from <a href="margla.htm">Margla</a> which will add several additional destinations to the <a href="../../hut_valen/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a> <a href="../../hut_valen/navsys.htm">NavSys</a> database.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She... often wanders the streets of Centrys in various forms, typically a young urchin girl, or a young woman of average means, but always with a nondescript face and demeanor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../non_pub/planescape/lady_pain/lady_of_pain.htm">Reference Data</a> - originally from off-site</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She... will write in the dead language of the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a>. <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> learns this as part of the awakening as the Great Mother.</p>
