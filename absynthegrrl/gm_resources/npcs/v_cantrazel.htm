<p class="pagecaption">Valerie Cantrazel</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Long time <a href="../places/karanal/icicle.htm">Icicle</a> resident miner. She is one of the miners working the Desolation Mer. Her camp was the farthest from any of the main encampments and situated against one of the barier mountain ranges. She found the Creation Team ship wreckage.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She was the person <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> was sent to investigate and kill. <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> instead protected her and tried to fade into the <a href="../places/karanal/icicle.htm">Icicle</a> local scene. It worked for several years and they were mining partners first and became lovers as time went on..</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valerie died in the plague that ravaged <a href="../places/karanal/icicle.htm">Icicle</a> four years after <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> settled in with her. Her death was the final driving factor in <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> becoming politically active and rising up the chain to become Premiere. <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> will light a single candle to Valerie every year on her birthday and her death day. This is the only ritual <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> will never fail in.</p>
