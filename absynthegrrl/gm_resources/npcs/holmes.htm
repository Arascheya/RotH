<p class="regtxt5">Sherlock Holmes (b. 1854): of 221B Baker St. - Located at H-10 and I-10 of the 1859 map.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Amid the ranks of Gothic Earth’s criminals, there is no name more feared or respected than that of Mr. Sherlock Holmes. It is said that there is no greater detective in the world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Holmes has studied at a number of prestigious schools, but has never completed any formal education program or received a degree of any sort. He is a masterful chemist, a talented criminologist, and possesses a good grasp of the physical and social sciences. These skills, combined with his brilliant analytical mind and almost perfect memory, enable him to solve virtually any mystery put before him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Despite his abrupt and often caustic manner, Holmes has forged strong friendships with Dr. John Watson and the noted writer Arthur Conan Doyle. During his investigations, he frequently relies upon the former for medical advice. Doyle and Watson have collaborated in the chronicling of Holmes’s adventures, beginning in 1887 with A Study in Scarlet. Other notable exploits in the life of the detective can be found in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes ( 1891 ) and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1893).</p>
