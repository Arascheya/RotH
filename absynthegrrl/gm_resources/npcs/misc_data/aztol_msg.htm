<p class="regtxt5">Greetings, Eltaryn.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I just wanted to send this little note to let you know I finally got to meet that delightful daughter of yours. She’s rather cute in a skinny, vacant sort of way. I must express my sadness though at her mental state. How two people as talented and brilliant as you and Kayara could produce a child as empty headed as she is seems to be rather a genetic tragedy, don’t you think?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I couldn’t even hold a conversation with her until I’d heavily dosed her with coffee, even then she seemed on the verge of returning to the dreamy, disoriented state she remains in most of the time. And that temper - you really should have done more to set boundaries with her. We were sitting having a nice discussion about magic and technology when she suddenly leapt from her chair and ran screaming for the door. I certainly wouldn’t have felt right letting her poor manners go unrewarded, but when I had one of my associates attempt to return her to her chair, she killed him. No conversation, no asking him to unhand her or anything, she just swiftly and effectively executed him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Well, needless to say, that slowed me right down. Rather than try and restrain her myself, I let her go. I did try and have her followed though. I didn’t really want her to kill some other innocent in town. The last I saw she was being swallowed up by some type of spatial tear. I don’t think it was anything you use, it just didn’t have that refined, over-controlled feeling that so much of your things have. I do hope she has found her way back to you. Why, if my own daughter went missing, I’d move heaven and earth to get her back, especially if she wasn’t quite right in the head. It’s been so good to talk to you again, take care now!</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Your friend and nemesis,</p>
