<p class="pagecaption">Renee "Rainy" Mirash</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rainy is the chief pattern maker at <a href="../places/eternia/emetals.htm">Eternal Metal Works</a>. She is the one Kali works closely with when creating the replacement parts for <a href="../../docs/DeathCity/dev/d_leopardess.htm">Leopardess (K666)</a>. She has the ability to feel very small differences in metal parts and patterns, rarely needing to rely on measuring devices except for the highest precision.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She has a very relaxed deamor that hides an almost fanatical attention to detail. She is able to see enough of the big picture to be good as the chief pattern maker.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Underneath her relaxed exterior is a person who is wound quite tight. Do not piss her off or the spring will explode in your face. She does not carry a grudge afterward though. So if it looks like trouble is on the way it is best to get her to explode and be done with it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rainy lives in an older <a href="../../common/place_images/rainyapartment.jpg">apartment building</a> just off <a href="../places/eternia/citycath.htm">City Cathedral</a> square of Goth City. Her turret style front room has a perfect <a href="../../common/place_images/rainy_view.jpg">view</a> down onto the cathedral itself. The park can be seen through a break in the buildings to the front and left of the cathedral. She can often be found at <a href="../places/eternia/dans.htm">Dans Macabre</a> in her off hours dancing with her friends, including <a href="triana.htm">Triana</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She uses both apratments on her level of the building. One is where she lives, the other is her studio, where she creates strange sculptures from found items, bits of scrap, and pieces she fabricates. Some of her work is on display n various areas of the city and <a href="../places/eternia/emetals.htm">Eternal Metal Works</a>.</p>
