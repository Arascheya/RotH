<p class="pagecaption">Slayers</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slayers are:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">always young women</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Typically do not survive to reach 20 years of age</p>
<p class="regtxt5">If ‘properly’ conditioned do not question the council’s hierarchy and control</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Typically they lived longer before the council removed the linking ritual</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slayers report to the <a href="../info/watchers.htm">Council of Watchers</a> headquartered in London. They are alway young women, usually chosen between ages 14 and 16. Often they do not live more than 3 or 4 years after being called.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Be council precedent Slayers tend to be loners, with few friends and family ties. This allows them to concentrate primarily on their duties. This also leads to isolation and a rapid expiration, but the council believes the benefits of this policy outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Princess Maria</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Maria is the daughter of <a href="carol1.htm">King Carol I</a> of Roumania and she is the current incarnation of the Slayer. She is willful and head-strong, excelling in things girls weren't usually interested in. Only her position as the Princess allows her the freedom of options to become the Slayer. By council desires she is a bit of an anomaly, they wish she had less connection to her family and no political connections.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For the past 2 years she has spent most of her efforts in Roumania and nearby Transylvania. She has encountered Prince Sergei, but has not yet staked him. He intrigues her and he has no desire to remove the Slayer while she is still cleaning up some of the more dangerous groups of younger vampyr. As yet the council is unaware of the attraction between them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Princess Maria was called at 16 and has done well, lasting 4 years so far. Part of this is due to help from Prince Sergei during her mssions in Roumania.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Princess Maria lives in Peles Castle, Sinaia, Roumania with her father King Carol I. She was born in 1875.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For the tales of Angelique, Princess Maria is a <a href="../info/hunters.htm">Hunter</a>.</p>
