<p class="pagecaption">Raisilian Alakzar</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Appearance: tall, thin blonde man, may be half elven, it's hard to tell from pictures.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Raisilian was an apprentice to Tesch Mar at the same time as Kalyana ni Raisul. He was one of Kalyana's few actual friends. They met when they were both learning from Tesch Mar.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Raisilian knew what happened to the Moon Stones that Tesch Mar used to imprison the Lizard Kings. He kept the secret until his death when it died with him. For the last days of his life he was pursued by those Nyigroth had sent to find him.</p>
