<p class="regtxt5">Details:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She has a very high level of anger and despair - the anger mostly has been translated into dispair through circumstances around her. She has a hard time being pro-active and may not survive if she cannot find a way to re-route around the despair/depression effects.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Originally a resident of Marwatt’s Reach, she was <a href="ayesha.htm">Ayesha</a> was her lover until she was killed by security troops for the <a href="../info/outsystems.htm">Outsystems  Resource Development Company</a>. They are a mega-corp that was granted exclusive development rights of Marwatt’s Reach and several other <a href="../places/karanal/fringesys.htm">Fringe Worlds</a>. They consider anyone and everything on their worlds as their personal property. Human right violations are rampant, yet difficult to prove. Few will agree to testify in any investigations. Those that do usually disappear before the actual hearings can begin. <a href="ayesha.htm">Ayesha</a>’s first lover was killed while they were working to gather enough evidence to bring charges of xenocide and other major crimes. <a href="ayesha.htm">Ayesha</a> was killed getting Kyira off world with their accumulation of evidence.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Need to build tension between despair induced inertia and desire to thrive, is constant battle in her mind, every day.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She has been used by <a href="../info/outsystems.htm">OutSystems</a> as a poster child for their program of ‘helping’ indigents respond to changing world situations. They educated her and employ her in their database and program development group. At first she was a token hire, but she has done well for herself in terms of learning as much as she can. She is cynical about the company since it was pretty obvious what they were doing. She was one of only 15 <a href="../monsters/vamyr.htm">Vamyr</a> to receive this opportunity. The others were given quiet exile or extermination. The company claimed most <a href="../monsters/vamyr.htm">Vamyr</a> were already dead before they acquired rights to Marwatt's Reach.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She was ‘adopted’ by a company manager’s family under direct instruction from the company planetary director. Her life has been restrictive and emotionally numbing. She has been left damaged and despondent. She was hustled through the same sort of education and social things that the couple’s other children were. Her feeding needs were handled by the company medical staff. She was shown constantly as a company success story and then shuffled into a dead end job in programming. She is actually a good programmer with an ability to pick up new languages quickly and easily.</p>
