<p class="regtxt5">Uru Live KI: 00203081</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was born Mary Jane Flatbush-Zarev, in a small town in Oklahoma. She grew up sheltered by her parents and the community, until it was time to go off to college. She had applied to a lot of places, hoping to get out of BFE Oklahoma, and was accepted to a medium town university in another state. Her parents died in a traffic accident late in the summer before her freshman year. Only then did she find out they had money, enough she could afford the first few years at university. The stress drove her to a psychiatrist in the university town. She put Mary Jane on anti-anxiety meds for a while because she was freaking out. She also recommended the diary writing to try and sort things out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Over break, between her first and second semesters, she changed her name in an attempt to change herself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In her past she has bartended, mixing stiff drinks and sometimes getting fired for it, tried working as a barissta and not doing well at it, before she was hired by a local game development firm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She rooms wuth <a href="uru_irena.htm">Irena</a>, in a place they have kept since they were both working at Waverly's Pub.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">she offers drinks in the Kahlo Pub for conversation about in cavern events and the like. wants to stir up discussion of DRC, Cate, etc. - try to downplay random, non-productive bitching</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She kept a <a href="../../docs/GameTales/urulive/diary_shandi.htm">diary</a>, on and off, throughout her life. Once she became computer fluent, she moved it to optical media and keeps it hidden in her game cases, usually in the Myst: Exile one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider - fixing up old <a href="../../common/item_images/uru_shan_spyder.jpg">sporty car</a>, because, while she doesn't really care all that much about driving, she doesn't want to not drive because of fear. She will tell those close to her that the spyder was a therapy car. Now she takes it to the local track and does laps, striving to improve her skill and her time. She has raced it, but rarely places and never higher than second. As she tells it, "I don't have the fire. I like going fast, trying to push myself, but I don't care if I win or not. It's just about improving my skill and keeping the fear at bay." She removed the convertible top, added a hardened roll-cage, fabbed a fiberglass cowling for racing, toughed the suspension, tweaked the engine to the max, added a racing transmission and clutch, and refitted all the brakes. She bought it in poor shape and spent months working on it. She tested the roll-cage by rolling the car on her fourth time out on the track. She walked away because of the cage, but had to spend several more months rebuilding the car. She would have stopped driving if Ted hadn't forced her into his car, after making sure she was ok, and made her do several more laps. She loves to go fast, but doesn't car about the racing part.</p>
