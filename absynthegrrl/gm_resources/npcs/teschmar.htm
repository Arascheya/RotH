<p class="pagecaption">Tesch Mar</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He was thought to be one of the greatest mages ever to have lived. He died(?) in a fight with Nyigroth that caused the Great Wastes about 400 years ago. Created a fortress after coming across a book speaking of the magical constructs of Margla FleshFeaster. He bound the Lizard Kings into the pocket universe of Trezgath when they threatened to destroy the human cities of the desert plains. He used an artifact of great power and scattered the control crystals for it when he was done. These became known as the Tears of Kharatoum after the disasters visited upon his friend the Sultan of Kharatoum. His theories and abilities are legendary. Every so often an item he created is still found in long abandoned hordes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He is also known for the Tesch Mar Hypothesis of Unified Universal Magic and his thesis on Gates</p>
<p class="regtxt5">books dealing with his life:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">On Tesch Mar, A Commentary by Dyer Gwynn</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Details of the Life of Mar ibn Jasrid description of his early career and how he became an archmage</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Story Notes */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tesch Mar knows Margla only as the Mistress of Skelos. he was fascinated by the concepts of transdimensional and gate magic. after his time at the school of skelos he created a fortress based on Margla's concepts and work - he only knew what was common knowledge at the school - not that she had learned how to marry magic and tech - if keep the item of great power/lizard wizard bits - it needs to use hyperdrive control crystals in some way - these are the Star Stones</p>
