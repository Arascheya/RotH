<p class="pagecaption">Irendi Walker</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider: her mom was a shifter and died when Irendi was very young. She was raised by her father. Something kept the shifting capabilities dormant until she became very ill with something that triggered it. Could use the idea below that it was something she was exposed to based on her father's work. Might be a regeneration or healing enhancement that altered something in her that had been blocking the shifting abilities.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Original Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Became a shpe-shifter by accident after exposure to some type of tech experiment her father was working on. Figures in the Realms of the Hut Online story-verse and in her own tales.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Consider - what if they were working on some type of lycanthrope virus, as a possible vector for applying medicine - and she was exposed in some way. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider da angel-dust as template */</p>
