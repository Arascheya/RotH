<p class="pagecaption">Marta Coseco</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta is 5'7" tall, with brown eyes, and curly black hair.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta is <a href="kilashandra.htm">Shan</a>'s bedroom mate at Davisson School. Marta is a drama student. Her personality is open, outgoing, and a bit awed by being in Yew Nork.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her childhood was spent in a small village, near the citadel and Merlot in Haiti (rename as needed), where magic and voodoo were accepted as normal. She is one of the few that never completely lost the ability to see through the veil. Her father's family were practitioners of the old arts, retaiing much of the knowledge lost to most when the Cothlocs invaded. Her Aunt on her father's side, Dominique, is a high priestess and holder of the knowledge for the village.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta is more of an every-person, she's a bit lazy, but can focus, has a reasonable drive, but it doesn't consume her. She is also rather shy and uncertain in new situations, causing her to shadow Shan during orientation and the first few weeks of classes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta's aunt, Dominique, comes to the Meriksas shortly after Marta leaves Davisson. She is fleeing a religious persecution brought by an elected dictator, who is sympathetic to the Cothlocs. The Cothlocs have identified aspects of the old ways that could threaten their position and authority. Dominique will immediately recognizes Shan as a Guardian from the very old stories. She has some detail she can add, based on these stories.</p>
