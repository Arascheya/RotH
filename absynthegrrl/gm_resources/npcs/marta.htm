<p class="regtxt5">Marta is <a href="kilashandra.htm">Shan</a>'s bedroom mate at Davisson School. Marta is a drama student. Her personality is open, outgoing, and a bit awed by being in Yew Nork.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her childhood was spent in a small town, where magic and voodoo were accepted as normal. She is one of the few that never completely lost the ability to see through the veil. Consider - could be somewhere like Haiti or the area outside New Orleans.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta is more of an every-person, she's a bit lazy, but can focus, has a reasonable drive, but it doesn't consume her. She is also rather shy and uncertain in new situations, causing her to shadow Shan during orientation and the first few weeks of classes.</p>
