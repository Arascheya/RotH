<p class="pagecaption">Marta Coseco</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta is 5'7" tall, with brown eyes, and curly black hair.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta is <a href="kilashandra.htm">Shan</a>'s bedroom mate at Davisson School. Marta is a drama student. Her personality is open, outgoing, and a bit awed by being in Yew Nork. Marta is more of an every-person, she's a bit lazy, but can focus, has a reasonable drive, but it doesn't consume her. She is also rather shy and uncertain in new situations, causing her to shadow Shan during orientation and the first few weeks of classes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her childhood was spent in a small village, near the citadel and Merlot in Haiti (rename as needed), where magic and vudahn were accepted as normal. She is one of the few that never completely lost the ability to see through the veil. Her father's family were practitioners of the old arts, retaining much of the knowledge lost to most when the Cothlocs invaded. Her Aunt on her father's side, <a href="file:///z:/shapes/dominique.htm">Dominique</a>, is a high priestess and holder of the knowledge for the village.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta's father died when she was ten, after a short and unexpected illness. Since the village was too far away, no autopsy was performed. Her mom moved them to the coastal city, where she maried her step-dad, a visiting businessman from Savnaugh, down to buy art and beads. They moved there when she was eleven. Her mom enrolled her in Cothloc school until it was time for high school.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By high school her step-father had convinced her mom that she should be allowed to make her own choices around religion. This let her attend regular high school. She met <a href="seraphina.htm">Seraphina</a> during first year in high school. See <a href="seraphina.htm">Seraphina</a>'s story for a bit more on Marta and her. <a href="seraphina.htm">Seraphina</a> introduced her to Madam Iyasha, who formally started to train her as a vudahn practitioner. Marta is a natural.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta's mom desperately wants her to marry a nice man of her race and settle down to have babies. Marta has no interest in men or in babies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta's aunt, Dominique, comes to the Meriksas shortly after Marta leaves Davisson. She is fleeing a religious persecution brought by an elected dictator, who is sympathetic to the Cothlocs. The Cothlocs have identified aspects of the old ways that could threaten their position and authority. Dominique will immediately recognizes Shan as a Guardian from the very old stories. She has some detail she can add, based on these stories.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Need to determine what Marta is having nightmares about - could be something in her youth - did she see something about how her father was killed?</p>
