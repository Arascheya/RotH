<p class="pagecaption">NPC Thalasa (Tala)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thalasa was born in a small, remote village on a world that was converting to mono-theism. Her village was assimilated by the priest-missionaries when she was sixteen. Until that time men and women were viewed as equals and were able to persue any tasks they could handle. After the assimilation, the women as original sinners and inferiors became the code. Many in the village were killed outright to support this conversion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tala ran before the priests could burn her as a heretic and was captured by the slavers. Their treatment of her broke her, making her cold and vicious. She hates and distrusts all men and will torture and kill them whenever she can. Her favorite torture is to cut off their genitals and feed them to them, then watch them bleed out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tala has been voluntarily mute since her enslavement.Tansy is the only one not disturbed by this. They have created several non-verbal ways of communicating.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her father taught her the basics of sailing and fishing because she wanted to know. When the <a href="../info/sisters_web.htm">Sisters of the Web</a> head to sea, she will be the core of their sailing expertise. It might be necessary to hire some actual sailors until the <a href="../info/sisters_web.htm">Sisters</a> can be taught. By the time the <a href="../info/sisters_web.htm">Sisters</a> are relocated, Tala should be an experienced captain and capable of becoming the pirate queen she ends up as when they reach the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>. The <a href="../info/sisters_web.htm">Sisters</a> become allies of Kayara with Tala taking over an old Aztol base and <a href="shareya.htm">Shareya</a> setting up the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern of Dark Delights</a>. <a href="sharyl.htm">Stormy</a> and <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a>, using magic and psychology, have restored some of her shattered mind. She still hates and fears men, however she can control the rage and fear enough to wait for attacks before responding.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* next section needs to be revised since it came more from Shardra and is likely out of date */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Personality: what's in it for me? However she does have the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a> sense of honor and will honor contracts and agreements she enters into. She will accept Letters of Mark or other contracts that specify a specific target if it suits her interests or if the reward is high enough.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is a pirate working the Crowded Sea below the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>. <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> gifted her with <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a>'s old holdings in the Crowded Sea once he fled. She shifted her alliances to <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> after <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol</a> went off the edge. She Also has ties to <a href="elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> although she honors her ties to <a href="kayara.htm">Kayara</a> more. She forms a pipe-line of information and resources to <a href="ghostship.htm">Milo/Ghost Ship</a> and to the agents scattered around the <a href="../places/val_exp/val_exp_inx.htm">Valley of Experiment</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is aware of <a href="kalyana.htm">Kalyana/Shade</a> as a new pirate force working from the east and spreading into the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a> waters. The battle barge has curtailed her actions toward the east. She is now concentrating on the Crowded Sea area.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="lisette.htm">Lisette</a>, her other closest friend, has taken over the Thieves Guild in the <a href="../places/lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>. The guild houses in several major Lotus Empire cities are connected with the entrances to the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern of Dark Delights</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Adventurers in the know will use the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern</a> as a short cut between the linked cities. The staff of the <a href="../places/shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern</a> will not reveal this. It is up to the adventurers to figure it out on their own. Also, the portals will only return an adventurer to the place or places they have already been.</p>
