<p class="pagecaption">Shae Anders</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae has known <a href="dan_fredricks.htm">Dan</a> and <a href="lara_march.htm">Lara</a> since junior high. She is supportive of <ahref="lara_march.htm">Lara</a>'s changes and the three have remained very close.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae works at her <a href="felicity_anders.htm">mother</a>'s new-age shop, doing readings, making tea, and filling online orders. She can work the counter and main rooms, but doesn't like that as much.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae's mom, Felicity, is a single mom. Her father died shortly after her birth. Her mom worked as an office manager for Edward Stark, owner of the Wilma and a theatre conglomerate, before starting the new-age shop when Shae was starting junior high school. In the summers they would take off in her mom's van and sell new-age items and give readings at various fairs around the area. This was the inspiration for the shop. Shae started doing the readings on trip when her mom was too busy. Her mom saw she had the 'sight' for it and had her handle the readings even after her own work-load dropped back down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Felicity and Edward are in a relationship that is in flux. They are in the process of going from former employee-employer to romantic and are not quite sure how to make it work. Edward wants Felicity to return as his number two person because of her business smarts. She loves the new-age shop and the quirkiness it allows, so is not certain what to do with the offer.</p>
