<p class="pagecaption">Ishra - Queen of Spiders</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ishra is True Neutral with an honorable ethos. She has ruled the Gate Dimension since it was created near the begining of the multi-verse. She began life as just another resident of the <a href="../places/roth/abyss_665.htm">665 Layer of the Abyss</a>. As she grew up, her mother was investigating various ways to create a gate between their realm and another. She succeeded when Ishra was eighteen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Gate opened into a realm of vastly different energy levels than Ishra's world. Everything near the Gate was sucked through, creating a tear in the multi-verse so severe that the <a href="../info/3sisters.htm">Sisters</a> had to directly interfere to prevent massive dustruction. They created the Gate Dimension as part of the patch to fix the multi-verse. During the emergency setup many of the beings sucked through the Gate were bound to the Gate Dimension as residents. Ishra became more, accidentally being Uplifted to god status.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She became bound to the Gate Dimension as a keeper, stabilizer, and controller. She could feel and detect anything happening, if she relaxed and let her awareness expand. The Uplift and binding originally drove her mad, until the <a href="../info/3sisters.htm">Sisters</a> healed her mind and body.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ishra is a friend of the <a href="irena_k.htm">Balance Keeper</a>. She has assigned several beings from her domains to assist the <a href="irena_k.htm">Balance Keeper</a>, including the driders that form the <a href="../monsters/keepers.htm">Keepers</a> for the <a href="../places/eternia/repository.htm">Great Repository</a> and the <a href="../monsters/gatherers.htm">Gatherers</a> that gather the data.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Because the Web Gates touch so many worlds, religions about the Queen of the Webs have emerged on many worlds. In older times Ishra was worshipped as a goddess of life. Her webs symbolized the links between all life, death, and rebirth. It was through this style of worship that she gave out the <a href="../char_type_info/dwseduct.htm">Death Womb Seductress</a> blessing. The blessing was only part of the healing offered by the Ishra temples. There were also spells and skills, such as <a href="../info/rulebase/inno_restore.htm">Innocence Restored</a>, to heal the trauma of the rapes and abuses heaped on the victim. There were rituals and spells to purify the body and remove any taint left behind, including any unwanted pregnancies. There were sessions with priestesses and other survivors to restore the spirit of the damaged women.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The blessing itself was conferred so that no being could ever again take advantage of a former victim. In extreme cases Ishra would implant a <a href="../monsters/demons/rider.htm">Rider Spider</a> to provide additional stability and comfort. This spider was a specially blessed form of the <a href="../monsters/gatherers.htm">Gatherers</a> she assigned to the <a href="../npcs/irena_k.htm">Balance Keeper</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ishra also made available the <a href="../char_type_info/spidersoul.htm">Spider Souled</a> transformation. She did this for those desiring to protect themselves and others from the ravages of brutal societies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ishra gifted these healing and defensive capabilities to the head of <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a>, in <a href="../places/planescape/centrys.htm">Sphere</a>, as part of the suite of healing they could use. These abilities remiain available, in an untainted state, to the Mistress of <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a>. <a href="aztol.htm">Aztol's</a> perversion of them only effects his use of these abilities.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As time has progressed, some worlds have drawn away from her worship. Others have perverted it to make her a demon or an evil being. Ishra herself remains uneffected by these distortions, however, lesser spider godlings were brought into existence by the energies focused by the splinter worshippers. None of these have any power in the Gate Dimension, but they do have regular godling powers in the rest of the multi-verse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One of these godlings created the spider ship that Aztol commandeered. This particular godling lived on one of the levels of the Abyss.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Ishra, An Overview</p>

<p class="regtxt5">by: Kyerashandra Alextra, Miskatonic University, Senior Researcher, Religious Magic Thought</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ishra, known as the Demon-Queen of Spiders, is an old being, one of the earliest known goddesses. While she is reviled and feared in the current times, she was once the patroness of women and seen as a goddess of life. Her webs represented the interconnections of all things. She sat upon the Demon Web and controlled the <a href="../gates_inx.htm">Web Gates</a> leading to and from the Web. The Web is a safer way to travel through the Gate Dimension. Its walls reduce the mutations that beings experience when exposed directly to the full energies of the <a href="../info/gate_dim.htm">Gate Dimension</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ishra could be considered true neutral in her dealings with the various races of the multi-verse. She has a sense of honor and obligation to her worshippers that guides her responses to threats against them. To all others, she appears indifferent or cold.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In recent times other gods and goddesses have used their base of worshippers to tear down and disparage the older ones. Ishra has born more than her fair share of these attacks. Some believe it is because she has always been associated with spiders and things of the dark. Others believe it is a deliberate attack on the value of women in general since many other fertility, nature, life goddesses have been targeted as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ishra has always been the patroness of the Dark elves, the dwellers in the under halls of many worlds. This now holds true for two-thirds of the worlds on which the Dark Elves have colonies. The other colonies still acknowledge Ishra but have turned their most intense worship to other, newer, deities.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are recent rumors and theories that something has happened to the goddess outside of the usual decrease in number of worshippers. Some of these rumors have been spread from various temples where the goddess no longer answers the priestesses, or answers in unexpected ways.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a great deal of mythology and legend wrapped around Ishra. Some see her as the darkest evil, while women of many times have found her to be a tireless champion. Other legends say she is a close friend of one of the Greater Powers. Still other legends talk of her providing caretakers to the Great Repository, said to hold the experiences and memories of countless civilizations, races, and cultures.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ishra resides in the Gate Dimension, though she maintains contact with the 665th layer of the Abyss. This layer contains spider and spider-like beings of all kinds. For an abysal layer, it is quite pleasant, sporting towering trees, reaching skyward from deep valleys, carved into rugged mountains. The forests are dim and warm, filled with abundant plant and animal life to support the folk of the lands. The spirits of her dead worshippers mingle with the fogs and vapors from the forests forming dense patches drifting throughout the lands. None would appear to be in torment to those visiting.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are countless references and tomes mention Ishra, rituals and practices related to her, and her effects on various histories. Very little serious research has been done into the evolution of religions surrounding Ishra or on Ishra herself. This seems a terrible oversite to this author as she is a fascinating entity, with a great deal of influence over the multi-verse.</p>

<a href="../monsters/gatherers.htm">Gatherers</a> - Collectors of information<br/>
<a href="../monsters/demons/rider.htm">Rider Spider</a><br/>
Awakeners - small spiders whose venom reduces or removes the ability of a mind to "see what it expects to see". The venom's effect varies depending on the physiology of the target. One being in ten thousand is sensitive to a viral component of the venom and becomes a "<a href="../info/sa.htm">Strange Attractor</a>", a being able to detect when potentially dangerous things enter the <a href="../info/multiverse.htm">realm</a> where they are. This conversion is potentially lethal as it re-writes the host genetics as part of the transformation, resulting in high fevers andconvulsions. The re-write enhances healing, adds better detection sensitivity, and leaves the host resistant to infection and disease.
