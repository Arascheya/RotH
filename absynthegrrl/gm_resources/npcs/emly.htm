<p class="pagecaption">Emly - Engineer - non-magic sections</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Emly is one of the two twins. She is the non-magical engineer on the Antigoni.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was born on one of the poor outer edge cities. Her mother died when she was young and a local beggar chief took her and her sister in. They became beggars for his group.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Emly and <a href="anta.htm">Anta</a> escaped from him by signing on with the Antigoni.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Emly and <a href="anta.htm">Anta</a> are twins. They bicker constantly among themselves but are fiercely loyal to each other as well. For personalities think a mix of Ed from Cowboy Bebop and Ana and Uni Puma from Dominion: Tank Police.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Emly is intensely loyal to the Antigoni and her crew.</p>
