<p class="pagecaption">NPC Concepts</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ideas for characters and tweaks for characters</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">River-like</p>
<p class="regtxt9">/* a River kind of day */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">dancing and swirling around in my head, more real than real. unbidden they swim to the surface at the worst of times. when i should be doing something else. concentrating on other things. more alive than life when i should be focused, thin shadows when i have time for them. perverse that way. why haunt me when i'm busy instead of still?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">am i ever really still though? head bouncing around, shadows, darkness, light, faces...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">sane but not - behind the eyes weird blurs</p>
<p class="regtxt5">shadows and fire and ash and wind - what was it? what is it? survived, but barely - sane but not...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">heavy sounds, need driving heavy sounds to pull the focus out...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">scurrying, scurrying here and there, set on meaningless tasks to fill the emptiness of time</p>
<p class="regtxt5">craziness spawns frenetic action</p>
<p class="regtxt5">craziness spawns inactive puzzlement</p>
<p class="regtxt5">what does it mean? in the end? nothing?...fills space/time</p>
<p class="regtxt5">brain fuzzed, numbness and bewilderment, stare at the screen and see symbols</p>
<p class="regtxt5">lives so full they are empty - not empty with fullness</p>
<p class="regtxt5">crazy other-space, light-headed muzziness, fuzzy clarity, clear murkiness</p>
<p class="regtxt5">fugue state disconnected connects - mind/body interupts</p>
<p class="regtxt5">child/woman looks through hazed eyes - come to see the unreal real or the real unreal she's never sure</p>
<p class="regtxt5">close/distant for so long...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">never trust the connects - fragile, burns</p>
<p class="regtxt5">connect/disconnect/connect in waves brain slides sideways on reality and time, then rights itself in a jerk, then tilts again, a helicopter in heavy winds</p>
<p class="regtxt5">coherence - so many need cohereance, an anchor in the storms, i like coherence it is my friend, mostly, until it goes out at night and finds its way back drunk and disorderly...then it is a rope and a noose and a stone...and not my friend at all as it rails against the chaos that should be a friend too..</p>
<p class="regtxt5">life support - need to remember life support, think, breathe, think, focus?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">should be able to step through the walls into otherwhere/otherwhen but it doesn't work right</p>
<p class="regtxt5">why doesn't it work? is real real that solid that other real is lost?</p>
<p class="regtxt9">/* focused River kind of day */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">seeking understanding of the real real and the other real
walking the line of them</p>
<p class="regtxt5">real real is hard and tedious - wall mart, jobs, school, mortgages, and expectations, and flourescent lights</p>
<p class="regtxt5">other real is just as real - it is the realms of Valen and Shandi, Death City and the Empire, the Hut and the game worlds, candle light and forest sunshine</p>
<p class="regtxt5">both are as real as the other</p>
<p class="regtxt5">i am confused by those who live only in real real</p>
<p class="regtxt5">somewhere in the past the real real was more real than other real but not any more</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the two blend best where there is grass and green and growing things</p>
<p class="regtxt5">real real is far more intrusive than other real</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the balance point is the shaky bit</p>
<p class="regtxt5">not enough other real - depression</p>
<p class="regtxt5">not enough real real - endangered survival</p>
<p class="regtxt5">then the balance with those who think only the real real is real - that is hardest of all</p>
<p class="regtxt5">hardest of all is to trust my definition of balance over another's</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the contradictions in another - grounded only in the real real even though they spin around their own center of oddness - how can that be?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">if there is a center to spin around how do they not see the other real?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">to know music without the other real is just strange...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">to enjoy movie, video, and written distractions so much and still miss the other real is strange</p>
<p class="regtxt5">maybe the link was broken in childhood instead of forged...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">so confusing really - whatever 'broke' in my head was 'fixed' in others</p>
<p class="regtxt5">i don't think they understand...but then i don't understand either...</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">i like my demons, mostly</p>
<p class="regtxt5">sometimes they make me crazy and not fun,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but i still like them</p>
<p class="regtxt5">i could numb them,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">get drugs to put them to sleep,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">but it seems too costly</p>
<p class="regtxt5">better to burn and choke on them,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">maybe even do myself harm than to deny they exist and pretend to like normal</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">sometimes the balance breaks and i go mad,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">better madness than normal,</p>
<p class="regtxt5">better anything than normal...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">anything to feel, to have existance beyond expectation and boring repetion</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">why live only in the real real?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">so many live only in the real real</p>
<p class="regtxt5">without the other real would there be art?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">would there be music or creativity or even hope?</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">isn't that ugly bane of existance religion an off-shoot of the desire for the other real?</p>
