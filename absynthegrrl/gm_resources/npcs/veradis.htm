<p class="regtxt9">Human female,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Ht. 5' 7", Wt. 115#, Age. 25</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Fighting Prowess: Fair with dagger though she travels unarmed.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Magic Ability: none</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Common Knowledge/Legend</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Veradis is the beautiful, red-haired, green-eyed wife of Keir Collis, a powerful merchant in the City. Three years ago she met Keir, who had worked for her father in one of his foreign offices, and married the man after a fairy tale, whirlwind courtship. Veradis's father made Collis his second in command, then tragically died three months later, leaving Veradis and her husband very rich.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Veradis and Keir are exceedingly happy together. Keir runs the business, keeping it alive and growing well beyond the holdings Veradis' father had left them. Veradis spends her time in many proper social functions. She has organized everything from food distribution to the poor to some of the most impressive and high-class parties in the City.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In many ways she is envied by most women in the City. Her husband is handsome, they are rich and they know all of the right people. She has everything anyone could ever want Hers is a life of leisure, without a care in the world, yet she has the compassion to help others. She is widely loved in the City.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Truth</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Veradis is not a happy woman. Not happy at all. She was not particularly inclined to marry at the time Keir Collis appeared, and he was not at the top of her list of suitors. In fact, she would not have married him at all except at her father's insistence. If Keir Collis had not tied her father's business up, and threatened to ruin him, Veradis probably would not even have spoken to him, much less married him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Veradis quickly struck a bargain with Collis. She would be the perfect wife for him, granting him everything he needed to remain successful, if he would provide her with enough money to do as she pleased. Each agreed the other should be allowed to take discreet lovers. Veradis has not taken a lover yet, but she has met and fallen in love with Kother Lansend, the semi-retired mage who operates the Singing Frog Tavern (CB3). She met him while organizing the distribution of food to the poor, but she has not revealed her feelings to him. She does not know if he returns her affections.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Veradis, as time passes beyond the death of her father, has grown less and less comfortable with the agreement she made to save her father from embarrassment She does not suspect Keir of having killed her father, though she would believe it if proof could be offered. There are many times she has thought of taking some money and slipping from the City unnoticed (possibly to visit her sister Daisha at Crumbling Skull Rapids), but the idea of leaving Kother has prevented her from acting.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Scenario Suggestions</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario 1: She's My Wife isn't She?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Veradis finally confesses her love to Kother Lansend and discovers he loves her as well. The two of them, realizing they could never be together in the City, run off. Keir hires the adventurers to bring her back, claiming Kother kidnapped her. He offers the adventurers a bonus if they will bring back Kother's head in the bargain. He tells the adventurers, "My wife has not been in her right mind since the death of her dear father. You cannot believe anything she says."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the players catch up with Veradis and Kother, they'll have to decide who to believe. Kother was an adventurer in his own right, and a good magician, so any attempt to steal his beloved or take his head will not be easy. Furthermore, as a trusted man in Nightside. Kother's denial of kidnapping would carry a great deal of weight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Another way into the scenario is to have the players approached by Ningal Arawaza - Kother's partner in the Singing Frog Sanctuary - to assist her in finding Kother. She has heard a group hired by Collis is out to murder both Veradis and Kother. She wants the players to help her save her friend, and to gather evidence in Keir's murder plot.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario 2: Old Friends.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One of the adventurers grew up with Veradis, but has not seen her in years (especially since the wedding). They meet accidentally, but renew their friendship and Veradis reveals what a sham her marriage is. She also explains how she was blackmailed into marrying Collis. Though she does not ask for help, the story should have enough "coincidences" - especially concerning her father's death - to spur any truly romantic adventurers on to break Veradis free of her husband. This will be more difficult than imagined, however, as the description of Keir later in the book will attest.</p>
