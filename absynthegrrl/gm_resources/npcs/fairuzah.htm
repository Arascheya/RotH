<p class="regtxt5">CFO, Rani Corp.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Born in Meriksa Union to parents who immigrated from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia">Presaara</a>. She is disillusioned by the way the Meriksa system actually works. Disappointed that the propaganda was so far from the truth for non-white people. <a href="vashi_r.htm">Vashi</a> met her driving cab in thecity where she went to university.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Fairuzah is a finacial genius and excellent at the decisions necessary to keep a for profit company functioning. She is as adamant as <a href="vashi_r.htm">Vashi</a> about not taking Rani Corp public.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Consider - one of her four room mates is the corporate lawyer, working a book store because she couldn'tfind legal work that wasn't really degrading.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">How would culture of her folks fit into her life? Remember, her parents are immigrants from a very different world.</p>
