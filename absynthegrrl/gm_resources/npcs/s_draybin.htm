<p class="pagecaption">Sarah Draybin</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Special Ops - <a href="../info/rani.htm">Rani Corp</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sarah grew up in a rough neighborhood of a major Meriksas city. She lived with her mom, in a shitty apartment and spent lots of time on the street. Her mom worked in clubs around the area and was a vocal advocate for tenant rights. She was killed when Sarah was fourteen by thugs from the local gang.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sarah was friends with <a href="jsolitaire.htm">Jaime Solitaire</a>, another kid in the hood and stayed with her after the death of her mom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sarah did surprisingly well in school and went into the local police force as soon as she could. She asked to be posted back to her old neighborhood, to try and clean up a bit. She rapidly became disillusioned with the police, because of how they prioritized policing and for the corruption she witnessed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Not long after <a href="jsolitaire.htm">Jaime</a> joined <a href="../info/rani.htm">Rani Corp</a>, she recruited Sarah for the security department. Sarah took to the special tactics and counter-measures training like she had been born to it. She was appointed head of Special Ops once it became apparent <a href="../info/rani.htm">Rani Corp</a> needed that kind of group.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sarah has trouble connecting with people on a personal level. She is haunted by seeing the death of her mother and the inability to do anything to or about the perpetrators. They were part of the corruption in the police and untouchable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider modifying this and making it part of the story</p>

<p class="regtxt9">My father was a drunk. I know what you are thinking comes next, but it isn't true. He loved my mother and me, he just loved his alcohol more.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">My earliest days were in Limehouse, not the new, posh, renovated areas, but the back places where the money hadn't gotten yet. Da worked whatever odd jobs he could keep and spent most of his money at the pubs. Ma worked as a cleaner for the posh crowd. Her money fed us and bought a thing or two for me, once or twice a year. I went to school, but it never really interested me. My love was books, adventure books of any kind, although I wondered why most of them were about boys as heroes and girls needing saving.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I didn't like playing with or hanging around the kids my age. The things they did were so stereo-typical of the gender standards and I couldn't cope. Books didn't force me into those molds. I could translate the boy hero into me, with just a bit of imagination,and that was almost enough.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I think I would have ended up like my ma, married to some sot, doing whatever scut work I could find, if da hadn't gotten killed, coming home from the pub, when I was ten. It was just bad luck, he staggered into the street and the posh woman was paying more attention to her cell phone and her kids than on driving.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ma tried for a bit to keep up, but we ended up moving in with her brother, my Uncle Albert Wellingham. He was a distant older gentleman, but he loved my ma and gave us the run of his place. He must have been wealthy, given where he lived, just off Temple Square, but it took me a long time to learn why. It wasn't until he found out about my love of adventure stories that he thawed to me. After that, he would regale me with stories of adventure in the real world. Slowly I found out they were mostly about the Templars throughout time.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I went to my first service when I was eleven and it was a revelation. History came alive through the ritual and pageantry of the experience. It spoke to the empty, lonely places in me and filled them with hope and warmth. I couldn't get enough after that. I went to every service I could and begged Uncle Albert to get me into the Temple School. It wasn't an easy task, given my poor performance in school until then, but he pulled strings and made it happen. I rapidly excelled, sucking down knowledge like cool water on a hot day.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">When the Orachi Incident occured and after the hideous changes it wrought in some of us, the Temple offered me hope and acceptance. There are some that cannot understand the bonds of tradition, belonging, and comfort that come from having a purpose, a guiding light in heaven, and the solidity of order and the unity of the fraternity. I pity them for they will never know the strength that comes from it.</p>
