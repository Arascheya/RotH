<p class="pagecaption">Irulan</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irulan is a friend of <a href="ghani.htm">Ghani</a> and works at <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a>. Irulan is one of the people who help at The Refuge, the shelter portion of <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irulan started life as a street kid after her one-dim parents accidentally emerged in <a href="../places/planescape/centrys.htm">Sphere</a>. They were killed in a dispute over right of way between them and one of the high ranking members of a faction. She used The Refuge extensively, becoming known, and then starting to help out. After a few years she was offered a permanent place to stay at <a href="../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a>. She is now the coordinator for The Refuge.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irulan has a coldness to her, usually seen the first time she is encountered. She will warm up to people as she gets to know and trust them. Dealing with the kids coming to The Refuge has given her a very developed ability to see through subterfuge and manipulation.</p>
