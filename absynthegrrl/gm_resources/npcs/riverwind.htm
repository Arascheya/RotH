<p class="pagecaption">River Wind</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The River Wind is a large river boat that works the ports of the Great River from the sea coast as far inland as Crumbling Skull Rapids, easily moving bulky cargo that is otherwise inconvenient to move by mule, camel, or wagon. Most boatmen avoid cruising the river at night, due to the risks of shifting sandbars, drifting logs. and the possibility of bandits. The River Wind, in contrast, moves at night and stops at the river ports during the days. Many a farmer has been startled to see its large silhouette quietly moving through the river mists in the dark of night.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The River Wind is powered by ancient tech provided to the original owners of the boat by <a href="ghunayya.htm">Ghunayya</a>. This system powers the paddle wheel on the back of the ship, using electric motors and a fusion reaction power pack. Contact with <a href="ghunayya.htm">Ghunayya</a> is through <a href="ghostship.htm">Milo Nimbletoes and the Ghost Ship.</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Curiously, the boat is not owned by humans (as is most of the river traffic), but by riverfolk, a furry, water-loving, nonhuman race. Though both their features and figures have a faintly human cast to them, their appearance reminds many of otters. Riverfolk usually avoid dealings with humans, due largely to the prejudice shown towards them. In the past, it was not uncommon for riverfolk to be robbed, beaten, and even enslaved by humans. Such incidents are fewer now, since most riverfolk wisely stay near their settlements in the marshes and distant reaches of the rivers and lakes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The owner of River Wind is <a href="rystya.htm">Rystya Darkbow</a>, ariverfolk very wise in the ways of the Great River, and skilled with both combat and magic. However after a serious incident involving a mine and the death of her sons, Corinth Lefthand and Calyx Bristleneck, she now contracts with the crew of <a href="ghostwind.htm">Ghost Wind</a> to run the river for her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> is the current captain of the River Wind. She is assisted by the rest of the crew from <a href="ghostwind.htm">Ghost Wind</a> and by Mila Longthumb. Mila was trained by <a href="rystya.htm">Rystya</a> in the art of river running. She advises the rest of the crew on river conditions.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The River Wind is a cargo vessel, carrying bulky goods from port to port along the Great River. Many farmers have small docks from which they load their crops on the boat. Since the River Wind moves at night, farmers hang lanterns on the docks to signal they have goods to be shipped. Hides and lumber are also typical cargoes, as are trade goods from the cities to smaller villages. The boat is fairly slow, with its many stops, but shipping rates are reasonably low, so that the cargo hold is nearly full much of the time. The Captain prefers not to carry passengers or livestock, but occasionally will do so when paid an extra fee.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Layout</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The River Wind has four decks. From top to bottom, they are the Bridge Deck, Cabin Deck, Main Deck, and Drive Deck. Below the Drive Deck are the Bilges. From forward aft (front to rear), the ship's three masts are the Foremast, Topmast, and Shortmast. The Topmast actually extends through the Bridge Deck down to the Cabin Deck.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Bridge Deck</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ladders (D) on either side of the Cabin Deck are used to reach the Bridge Deck.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A. Bridge: This is the highest compartment on the RiverWind, and the place with the best visibility. It is surrounded with windows, with a windowed door in the after bulkhead (wall). The Captain steers the River Wind from here, using a large, wooden wheel (C). Although hooked to a complex set of ropes and pulleys, the wheel is not physically connected to a rudder, but is an enchanted object that manipulates water currents to turn the River Wind. By clever use of the wheel, the Captain can make seemingly impossible maneuvers, like slowly moving sideways to the dock.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Two blaster rifles are kept in a locked cabinet by the wheel. Every crew member has a key to this cabinet.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">B. Dryout: The flat area aft of the Bridge is used to dry ropes and canvas (and sometimes clothes). It is sometimes used for sun-bathing by the crew when they are underway.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Cabin Deck</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Four ladders from the Main Deck lead up to hatches in the Cabin Deck. These hatches can be locked from above, but are normally left unlocked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A. Captain's Cabin: <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> and <a href="valen.htm">Valen</a> live in this cabin, which has two windows forward, and windowed doors to either side. The base of the Topmast stands in the center of the cabin. In this cabin are two trunks. One contains assorted day to day clothing. The other is locked and contains clothing and items from <a href="ghostwind">Ghost Wind</a>. Techno weaponry is stored in a compartment under the bed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">B.-C. This cabin was once two, now it stretches to both sides of the ship. <a href="krystal.htm">Krys</a>, <a href="lynn.htm">Lynn</a>, and <a href="will.htm">Will</a> share this cabin in an interesting and tempestuous three sided relationship. There is a large bed, three chests, and various personal items scattered about. There seems to be a constant war between entropy and order occurring in here.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">D. This is <a href="kyira.htm">Kyira</a>’s cabin. It has a homey, comfortable feel and is tastfully decorated.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">E. <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a> bunks here. It is as Spartan as her communication, consisting of a simple bed and a small chest with clothes in it. Also in the chest is a white jade box containing opium and a pipe. She uses it to relax on the occasions when she has had too many stimulants.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">F. This is the litchen, mess hall, and basic gathering room for the crew when the weather is too unpleasant for eating and hanging out on deck. The cooking unit is powered from the fusion pack that drives the engines, so the risk of fire is reduced.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">G. Ladders, to Bridge Deck.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">H. Hatches, to Main Deck.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">J. Base of Topmast</p>
<p class="regtxt5">L. Shortmast</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Main Deck</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Four ladders from the Main Deck lead up to hatches in the Cabin Deck. These hatches can be locked from above, but are normally left unlocked. Four hatches in the Main Deck lead down to ladders from the Drive Deck. These hatches are normally locked from below, preventing access to the Drive Deck. A fifth large hatch also opens down to the Drive Deck. This allows equipment to be moved in and out should repairs be necessary.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A. Foremast: This mast supports the hoist, used to load and unload cargo. It is also used to raise and lower the skiff.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">B. Hoist mechanism: Used to raise and lower the hoist. This is <a href="shandi.htm">Shandi</a>'s station when at the dock. She recieves hand signals from the others of the crew and works the hoisting system as necessary. She will have a large mug of incredibly strong coffee near her at all times when working the hoist. <a href="krystal.htm">Krys</a>, <a href="lynn.htm">Lynn</a>, or <a href="will.htm">Will</a> make sure the mug remains full. <a href="will.htm">Will</a> functions as load master determining where the cargo ends up.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">C. Skiff: A small boat, propelled with oars. One person can manage the skiff, although it can carry a sizable load. <a href="krystal.htm">Krys</a> usually operates the skiff.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">D. Main Doors: Entry into the Cargo Hold. The doors can open in or out, and one can be kept closed while the other is opened. There is a very small door in one of the main doors, so that a person can enter without unfastening them. Normally the main doors are locked when in port or carrying the rare passenger. <a href="kara.htm">Kara</a> and <a href="will.htm">Will</a> carry the only keys.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">E. Cargo Hold: The large area used to stow cargo. Typical cargoes include agricultural products, leather, trade goods, and sometimes building materials. However, most anything will be carried for the right price.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">F. Outer walkways.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">G. Ladders to Cabin Deck: Hatches at top may be locked from above; normally unlocked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">H. Hatches to Drive Deck: Usually kept locked. After the power system upgrade these are now ring keyed to <a href="krystal.htm">Krystal</a> and <a href="lynn.htm">Lynn</a>'s rings. <a href="lynn.htm">Lynn</a> was provided with a ring by <a href="ghostship.htm">Milo</a> when the ship went through the last engine service.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Power Deck</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This section is a maze of motors and power control equipment for the paddle wheel and the powered loading winch. There are also pumps and heating equipment for the head on the Crew Deck and power supplies for the cooking and cooling facilities in the pantry and galley.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Primary power is provided by a fusion reaction power plant with spent fuel cartridges being replaced by supply runs by <a href="ghostship.htm">Milo and the Ghost Ship</a>.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Bilges</p>
<p class="regtxt5">These are the sections under everything else where ballast can be qhifted using ballasting pumps in the engineering spaces. Another set of pumps keeps them relatively dry.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">River Wind is a river ship and thus has a relatively shallow draw. The under side of the hull has been strengthened with adamantite plates to allow it to survive the occasional encounter with a sand bar and in case another explosive charge is encountered.</p>
