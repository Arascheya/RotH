<p class="pagecaption">Ash Aragon</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ash Aragon is a member of the Ghost Precinct.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She lives in a crappy apartment in The Bronx. /* place and add address for use in trip planner */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Parents moved from eastern europe when she was very young.<br>
family was landed T'Zani, forced that way after one of the wars<br>
has brother, two years older than her<br>
parents killed by criminals for something when she was six, Ash may not know exactly what it was for<br>
she and her brother went into the system and were separated<br>
ash became very sick shortly after being placed in first foster home<br>
family couldn't cope with the after-care required for her recovery and threw her back into the system<br>
fever and delerium gave her visions of somewhere or somewhen else, convincing her to want more than what was offered around her<br>
brother landed in a good home, after 2 temp ones<br>
ash never fit in the homes she was placed in, roles were too rigid, religion was too weird, other children too mean<br>
desperately wants a situation where she is judged for herself, not her bank account or skill with money<br>
was a prostitute for a little while, until she killed her pimp when he tried to beat her<br>
joined police to dodge reprisals from the pimp's friends and to try and get pimps away from the other women<br>
found police was humans as usual, obsessed with ways of measuring each other against arbitrary standards, rules based in power games rather than practicality, enforced laws against women and "under-calasses" just because they could, and became disillusioned<br>
it all made her hard and uncaring, doing anything to keep her arrests up, even starting to sell out on her own odd ethics<br>
Section 13 was a breath of air, with Nikki being interested in real helping more than numbers<br>
she is insanely angry about the new oversight and what it brings, wants to blame Shan, but can't as she sees her suffering as much as she is under it<br>
has always considered herself a T'Zani and an outsider<br>
Is brother still alive, or was he killed in a gang fight that targetted the wrong building?
</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Raw Notes:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">hates humans from childhood trauma - lived in an area of town run by mobs and thugs, watched the day to day ugliness and it seeped into her soul<br/>
her family was landed Tzani, from eastern europe. Her parents longed for the old ways as they struggled to avoid the thugs and survive. moving was not possible - too little money and nowhere to go<br/>
considers herself Tzani - has no qualms about killing humans</p>

<p class="regtxt12">considers most humans gawakt (non-persons)<br/>
"it was gawakt, outsider, non-person. Killing gawakt does not matter."<br/>
considers ghost precinct people, thus non-gawakt</p>

<p class="regtxt9">assigned to ghost precint after several incidents of casual violence to suspects - was vindicated because suspects were guilty, which is why she was not suspended or imprisoned<br/>
    respects Talia and Shan after they demonstrate levels of dangerous competence at the library vaults<br/>
    likes Leia Cassini because she is as broken as Ash, only differently<br/>
    wants to learn the tactical skills she sees in Talia and Shan<br/>
    very pale eyes, which tend to look cold and empty most of the time, warm up with Talia, Shan, and Leia</p>
