<p class="regtxt5">Ash Aragon is a member of the Ghost Precinct.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Raw Notes:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Alt 2: family was distant and uninterested in her, did not or could not give her what she needed to survive contact with other children and their casual cruelty, so she grew up hating those around her, hated her childhood so much she has been known to say, "I wish my parents would have aborted me" on more than one occasion. considers having children to be extremely cruel and selfish because of how she felt about her own childhood. suicide was always in the top five options for her, it never reached number one, though</p>

<p class="regtxt9">hates humans from childhood trauma - lived in an area of town run by mobs and thugs, watched the day to day ugliness and it seeped into her soul<br/>
her family was landed Tzani, from eastern europe. Her parents longed for the old ways as they struggled to avoid the thugs and survive. moving was not possible - too little money and nowhere to go<br/>
considers herself Tzani - has no qualms about killing humans</p>

<p class="regtxt12">considers most humans gawakt (non-persons)<br/>
"it was gawakt, outsider, non-person. Killing gawakt does not matter."<br/>
considers ghost precinct people, thus non-gawakt</p>

<p class="regtxt9">assigned to ghost precint after several incidents of casual violence to suspects - was vindicated because suspects were guilty, which is why she was not suspended or imprisoned<br/>
    respects Talia and Shan after they demonstrate levels of dangerous competence at the library vaults<br/>
    likes Leia Cassini because she is as broken as Ash, only differently<br/>
    wants to learn the tactical skills she sees in Talia and Shan<br/>
    very pale eyes, which tend to look cold and empty most of the time, warm up with Talia, Shan, and Leia</p>
