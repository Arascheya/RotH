<p class="regtxt5">Ash Aragon is a member of the Ghost Precinct.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Raw Notes:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">hates humans from childhood trauma - lived in an area of town run by mods and thugs, watched the day to day ugliness and it seeped into her soul<br/>
her family was landed Tzani, from eastern europe. Her parents longed for the old ways as they struggled to avoid the thugs and survive. moving was not possible - too little money and nowhere to go<br/>
considers herself Tzani - has no qualms about killing humans</p>

<p class="regtxt12">considers most humans gawakt (non-persons)<br/>
"it was gawakt, outsider, non-person. Killing gawakt does not matter."<br/>
considers ghost precinct people, thus non-gawakt</p>

<p class="regtxt9">assigned to ghost precint after several incidents of casual violence to suspects - was vindicated because suspects were guilty, which is why she was not suspended or imprisoned<br/>
    respects Talia and Shan after they demonstrate levels of dangerous competence at the library vaults<br/>
    likes Leia Cassini because she is as broken as Ash, only differently<br/>
    wants to learn the tactical skills she sees in Talia and Shan<br/>
    very pale eyes, which tend to look cold and empty most of the time, warm up with Talia, Shan, and Leia</p>
