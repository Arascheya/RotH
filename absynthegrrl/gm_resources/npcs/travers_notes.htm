<p class="pagecaption">Travers Notes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The party informed you of various things they have surmised and found out. One is the council has said to ignore any thin grey demon-like beings. The party believes these beings are attempting to release a Cthulian Great Old One.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You returned to the council and started asking about this and Alistair Crowley's connections to this. Partly from your own curiosity and partly as a favor to the party.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Later in the day the players tracked you down at your apartment and said they had made a mistake by sending you to the council with the info about Crowley and the grey skinned things. They now believe you are in grave danger. To keep you safe they asked you to accompany them back to their living place, a bungalow on the Wellingham estate.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">On the way there they told you that they were in contact with Drusilla. While they didn't trust her, they believed her when she told them some of her <a href="ang_visions_game.htm">visions</a>. They also mentioned that they had a crazy friend who was now very attached to Drusilla and that this friend was part of their guarantee of safety.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At the bungalow they took you inside and led you to rooms you hadn't seen before. While they did this it rapidly became obvious that the inside of the bungalow was much larger than the outside indicated it should be. The party informed you that this was a magical construct that could move through space, time, and dimensions. Sort of like that time machine thing H.G. Wells had just written about.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Later that night the others return after venturing out to recover a crystal. Heron and Valen returned before the rest with two crystals and they were quite excited about it. Half an hour later Thock, Verkal, Drusilla, and Shandi returned with two more crystals. They talked of killing several of the grey creatures and of finding Dr. Jekyll and his servants already dead at his home. They also found an odd thing that Verkal refered to as a 'tardis'. With them they had a large book and a piece of elaborate machinery that they were going to look at more carefully later.</p>
