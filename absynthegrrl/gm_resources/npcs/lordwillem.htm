<p class="pagecaption">Lord Willem Wellingham</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Born 1847 to Lord Artemis Wellingham.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Willem has always been an adveturer, starting as soon as he was able. His father was forever extricating him from scrapes at school and later throughout the country-side.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In this line of development, the Wellinghams have been major players in the aristocracy for some time. This results in a large estate holding outside London and an immense and impressive <a href="../../common/place_images/wellingham.htm">mansion</a> to go with. As Willem develops the rail system, he will have private tack run to the estate to provide transportation to and from the ITC facilities.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His adventurous nature extended into his dealings with money and stocks. Once he demostrated his abilities his father turned over control of his stocks to Willem. By 1884 he has parleyed his father's part interest in Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL) into controlling interest. In 1892 he has uses his fortunes to buy out Georges Nagelmackers and take complete controller interest in the company.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lord Willem's father, Lord Artemis, used some of his money to fund a novelty item known as the Babbage Engine. Young Willem immediately saw the true potential of this device and became obsessed with creating a working version. He was further fueled by the enthusiasm of his fiance, then wife, <a href="annewellingham.htm">Anne Isabella Noel King</a>, daughter of Ada Lovelace. With her help and the help of Henry Babbage, son of Chagrles, they create several working models of Difference Engines. Once these prove out they begin the even more ambitious task of assembling an Analytic Engine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In 1889 a fluke accident at the WL headquarters in London gives a rapid boost to design and development. A mysterious doorway opens in the basement of the facility and Willem along with several trusted companions go through. One of the trusted companions is Andrew Murray, Mina's father and the comptroller of CIWL. They find themselves in beautiful downtown Centrys. After a couple of narrow escapes from run-ins with the locals they rescue the being who becomes the ICM chief engineer. This being has a tremendous knowledge of mechanical engineering and materials fabrication. With its knowledge the CIWL company produces the first working full scale Babbage Engine. Soon they are building them on contract and selling these Computational Engines world wide. In 1893 Lord Willem creates International Computing Machines to handle production, distribution, programming, and maintenance of the new Computational Engines. Using ideas and knowledge from his chief engineer these machines rapidly evolve from Babbage's beginning concepts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After the arrival of the Hut and conversations between the Wellinghams, the Chief Engineer, and Valen the concept of electrical computational systems enters the mix. Valen pointed out the increased speed and reduced size that could be reached once electrical components could be fabricated.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lord Willem, Andrew Murray, and Artemis Harker form the basis of the <a href="../info/doorkeepers.htm">Keepers of the Doors</a> soon after their return with the Chief Engineer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anne Wellingham becomes involved as soon as Lord Willem mentions the computing machines to her. Using her mother's notes she develops the basic language for programming these new systems. Once this occurs Lord Willem begins on his most audacious undertaking, the creation of a Channel Tunnel. Once again he relies heavily on his chief engineer for materials designs to support his developments. Using the recent developments of electricity the plans are to run electrically powered helper engines to move trains through the "Chunnel".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Willem was always a social progressive, however it is greatly intensified when he has a smart daughter of his own. <a href="lucywellingham.htm">Lucy</a> is curious and aware. When she begins to track the issues facing women in the society around him, he listens and formulates various policies based on what she tells him. He will make no distinction in pay, working conditions, or opportunities between women and men in any of his holdings. In the case where he finds disparity being created the offending manager will be reprimanded or relieved of duty depending on severity and frequency of offense. He has devised a way for women working at <a href = "../info/ciwl_etc.htm">ITC</a> to maintain their funds in an <a href = "../info/ciwl_etc.htm">ITC</a> holding where they can decide who may gain access. He will provide care facilities, legal advice and counsel, and hospice/safe lodgings if desired. He also uses the considerable political advantage he has to champion social equality causes. Update the information in the alternate 1880s folder of Info to reflect the more rapid advances of equality in some cases. The situation has to support the growth of the mega-corp controlled world and roles of women sufficient for Lucy and Mina to realistically hold their positions at <a href = "../info/ciwl_etc.htm">ITC</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After conversations with Valen he realizes the dangers of allowing the nation-state leaders to start conflicts. Conflicts that will reduce the need for his materials and that will get in the way of projects such as the Channel Tunnel. He begins a technology sharing and disemination campaign, targetting fellow industrialists in nearby countries. He follows it up with an agressive strategy of information gathering and financial tactics, befriending the most willing and undermining the more difficult. By the start of the 20th century, he has set the groundwork for the beginning of the <a href="../info/mega_ascend.htm">Mega Corp Acendency</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There actually was a Channel Tunnel project started in the 1880s on primary earth. See <a href="../../hut_online/alt_london/index.shtml">this link</a> and <a href="../../hut_online/alt_london/index1.shtml">this link</a> for details. Use this as a starting point for the concepts used by Willem and the Engineer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider adding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Tate">Henry Tate</a> as one of Willem's friends */</p>
