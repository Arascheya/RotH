<p class="pagecaption">Olivia Bishop</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Olivia Bishop is part owner of <a href="../info/ezra_magic.htm">Ezra's Magic Shop</a>, with her other two sisters, <a href="nikki_b.htm">Nikki</a> and <a href="mira_b.htm">Mira</a>. Olivia is a potion and practical magic guru, able to easily pick up potions and spells from a variety of sources. She works mostly behind the scenes in the shop. Usually a referal is required to use her services. Sometimes she will see a cold-calling client if Mira or she find them compeling or distressed enough.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Olivia is having strange dreams based on the residual memories of the pilot of the starship that crashed in the desert. This starship brought evacuees from Karanal to Earth after the Zeltropian evacuation.</p>
