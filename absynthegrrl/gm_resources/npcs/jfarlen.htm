<p class="regtxt5">Profession/Title:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Decker/Land Lord</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Physical Description:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">A slight, wiry man, just beyond middle age. he is in excellent physical condition and works to maintain it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Personality:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">He is quiet and keeps his own council on many things. He has a very dry wit which he lets out only with his friends. It is the only way to really know you are more to him than just an acquaintance. He personally screens the applicants to his building and lets in only those he thinks he can trust. Once you have proven that to him he will thaw slightly. He does not talk of his past, yet the impression is there that someone burned him very badly.</p>
