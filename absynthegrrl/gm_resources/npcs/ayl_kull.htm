<p class="pagecaption">Aylinn and Kull - previous player character</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aylinn and Kull are working in the capitol city as a seamstress and gem setter.  They live and work in the poor noble section of town.  Their workmanship is fantastic.  It is rumored that Aylinn maybe an arcane but no one has ever proved it one way or the other.  Their shop and living quarters are never broken into as Aylinn's pet snake is very poisonous and has a short temper.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kull is some where in his 50s or 60s, has graying hair, but is still in good shape.  Aylinn is a little younger than he is, but her hair is still the deep black it was when they moved to the capitol.  It is due to her appearance of none aging that has set up rumors of arcane and mixed heritage.  An elf or some one familiar with elves would recognize Aylinn as being part elf and half human with some thing else there also.</p>
