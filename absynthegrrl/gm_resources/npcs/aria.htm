<p class="pagecaption">Aria - previous player character</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aria comes from the region near the Isle of Experiment. She was a player character in the Dhar Ankes/Oriz scenario and one of the first iterations of the Hut.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* the following is some rough data on what was going on in this scenario/campaign package */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* transport to Hut - Minstrell of the Dawn was major clue holder at this point - the players enjoyed Gordon Lightfoot, so the song list was heavily his - plus there was a sharing of earth souls and Zelp souls in this campaign */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aria-</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You awaken in a room with walls, floor, and ceiling made of a silver metal with a lime green tinge to them. The room is lit with bright white light from square panels in the ceiling.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You feel as though someone has placed your head in a vise and squeezed, but the feeling is not physical, more like you have had too many things happening all at once and your mind has shut down and is now just beginning to wake up again. You have vague recollections about incredible sights of pasts, futures, and alternate "nows". None of the images are clear enough to actually remember.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">About twenty feet away from you you see a male human with curly light brown hair, going slightly grey, a close trimmed beard and he is wearing close fitting leggings/breeches of a blue colored coarse fabric and a woolen shirt with a checked pattern of bright colors. On the floor next to him is a strange wooden device, with strings, similar to a lute but with a different body shape.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As your head begins to clear you feel as if some part of yourself is missing but other parts are even more complete than they were before. As your head clears even more you realize part of the confusion is some of the feelings and emotions you thought were yours are actually those of Landria and Mia.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* concerning her father - something she is looking to find more about */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is from Aria's ring soon after she attuned it:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Oh feminine one your father was a tall red haired man, hailed as touched by the god Zat'ak himself. He was favored of the god, but not of the priesthood to whom he belonged. Long ago he began a search for the Holiest of relics of Zat'ak, an ebony orb of 3 foot by 2 foot dimensions, lost when the heathens overran Zat'ak and his forces. He has undertaken this quest of his own will, not by coercion. He is a kindly man always willing to help another in trouble, odd for an Arcane most people say. He left me for you after talking with an old gypsy seeress who told him you existed. He left the following message for you:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">My dearest daughter,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I know you do not know me for I had to leave before I even knew if you were to be. I did not intend to do that to your mother but things did not work as I had hoped. There are those also seeking what I hunt and they would have tormented her to get at me if I had stayed. Please tell her I have never forgotten her and hope she has trained you well.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I have left this ring to aid you, for a seeress told me of you and that you would follow the Arcane's path. I hope to find you once my quest is finished.  Grow strong and wise my daughter, remembering the joy of kindness.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Your loving father,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Ariander Longseeker</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* various bits of info picked up during the campaign */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Zat'ak: Info picked up in Oriz: Chief deity of the City of the Sacred Flame.  He dwelt among mortals and then immolated (1. To kill a a sacrifice. 2. To destroy or renounce for the sake of something else.) and ascended into heaven.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Info picked up on the Isle of Research: Started as a 7th Order Arcane wandering the High Valley region above Oriz.  At some point he found an artifact of power that boosted his magical abilities and his ego to unimagined heights.  He set forth on a program to drive  the sedentary merchant peoples out of the High Valley, leaving only the nomadic tribesmen, unified under him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">About 300 years ago he was immolated at a massive confrontation between his troops and the settlers.  Most arcanes believe that he was destroyed by the turning of his own magic upon him.  The artifact was not found but is believed to have been dimension or plane shifted by the force of the majik blast.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My Father: Tall, used to have red hair but is now bald.  Grey eyes.  When Mom knew him he was about 45.  Dad was born 150 yrs after Zat'ak emolated.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My Mother: Short, heavy set, dark complexioned, dark thick hair.  She was a worker of wood.  One day she found Father after he had encountered a wild beastie.  She nursed him back to health, fell in love with him but he had to leave for some reason.  He left directions to the Zetta Arcane Guild house.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Father was in Oriz in 6732, he kept moving, never saying why.  Went up into the High Valley in '33 and then on up and around to Glantri City.  Looking for a lead to the artifact he is looking for.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Old Seeress came to me saying that Father was in grave danger.  But could not see morethan that, for everything around him was shrouded in grey mist.  After consulting the Farserns it was established that she was seeing the future.  I will have time to reach him to save him if I stay with the boat and ride hard afterwards.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Readings and information to Aria from gypsy seer on Isle of Techno</p>
<p class="regtxt5">DESTINY: the visions of your destiny are muddled and confused but still tied to Margla in some manner. Too many seers and diviners are attempting to see the future, everything is clouded and veiled.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">COLD ONE: Margla</p>
<p class="regtxt5">TWINS: there are two sets of twins that feature strongly in most of the paths in the future</p>
<p class="regtxt9">SET 1: these twins are needed to gain access to the inner stronghold of the Hand, necessary to finally destroy him. They are a set of twins, most old. One using majik, the other abused by majik. They are dark haired.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">SET 2: these twins are red heads. One is the "Last Hope" and also the final member of the second triad. This twin will be the only one able to touch the Ertan Artifacts. These twins are daughters of Margla and your father. One of them will be selected as the Last Hope when the other being that could handle the Ertan Artifacts becomes possessed by allies of the Hand. The visions are not clear about whether this possessed one will still be able to handle the Artifacts. It is believed not but no one can be sure yet. The selection of which twin will be based on an event I have not yet been able to see but there is something specific that will happen.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">FIRST TRIAD: purpose unknown</p>
<p class="regtxt9">members:</p>
<p class="regtxt12">Cold one-Margla</p>
<p class="regtxt12">Blue Creature</p>
<p class="regtxt12">Margla's ex-consort</p>
<p class="regtxt9">bound together by Margla's curse they will all be freed by the second triad when the curse is broken.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">SECOND TRIAD: purpose is to lift the curse from the first triad</p>
<p class="regtxt9">members: three red haired daughters of Ariander Longseeker</p>
<p class="regtxt5">MARGLA'S CURSE: The curse was set upon her early in her majik training by an error in spell casting during an experiment. The backlash bound two others into the curse. The details of this curse are unclear.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">from the arcanes: all we know is anyone she takes as a lover dies very unpleasantly. The effect seems to require more than a one time affair.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">MARGLA: has aided in your father's survival so that he could father the required three red haired children to form the second triad</p>
