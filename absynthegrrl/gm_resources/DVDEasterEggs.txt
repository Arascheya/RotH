Watch the color bars.
I mean this both literally and figuratively. Often, studios hide their eggs in seldom-watched portions of the DVD, like the color bar calibration screen. For instance, the DVD for "Chasing Amy" has a funny introduction to the color bars by some of the crew.

If you don't scour every last thing on the disc, you may be missing out on something special. "The Matrix" is full of hidden stuff. Scattered throughout the disc, you'll find red pill icons. Clicking on them takes you to hidden featurettes.



Move around using your arrow buttons.
Use the arrow keys on your DVD remote to search through the menus. Press right or left at each selection, just to be sure you're not missing something hidden on the page.

Sometimes, icons in the picture behind the menu will be clickable, and if you select them, they'll take you to an egg.


On the "Little Nicky" DVD, go to the Central Park selection in the Special Features menu, and hold your left arrow. A halo will pop up over Nicky's head. Press Enter and you'll be treated to a sneak peak of New Line's upcoming trilogy "The Lord of The Rings."



Look for anything suspicious.
The more things you find, the more patterns you will see emerging. Anything that looks a little odd about a menu page bears some investigation.

For instance, on the "Bring It On" DVD, one of the menu screens has a cheerleader's megaphone icon. If you click on it, you get a goofy message from the film's director. Often stuff is hidden in company logos, messages, or shapes within the accompanying pictures.



Check the movie's edition.
Is this a special edition DVD or just a regular disc with few features? You're about 10 times as likely to get eggs out of a special edition, simply because more goes into the making of these DVDs. That doesn't mean there's nothing on non-special discs, it's just less likely -- and probably less spectacular.


Search the Web for DVD Easter egg information.
If you're having problems finding Easter eggs on your own, or want to be sure you're not missing something, take a look online. One of the most comprehensive lists of DVD Easter eggs on the Net can be found at codes.ign.com or DVD Review.
