<p class="regtxt5">Gate Keepers can use Arcane majik to 10th order. They weild <a href="../items/icedagger.htm">Ice Daggers</a> and are hit only with magic or enchanted weapons.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Sword of Lorsan or Soul Eater are required to displell them. Other weapons do damage until their hit points are exceeded, then the spirit returns to the Gate where the body reforms at the rate of 1 week per 2 CON points. Hitting a Gate Keeper causes 1d8 CON damage if the attacker is in contact with the weapon that has hit the Gate Keeper. This does not apply to missile weapons or the Sword of Lorsan or Soul Eater.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Gate Keepers are the living embodiment of a controlled Hell Gate. They can only be created at the same time that a Hell Gate is brought into being and they can only be totally destroyed if the Hell Gate is closed as well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Gate Keepers are only at their full strength if Seven Hell Gates are open. Creating any fewer Gates will result in weaker Gate Keepers. Trying to open more than seven Hell Gates on any world will automatically fail.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Creating a Gate Keeper and Hell Gate</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This requires the willing sacrifice of a powerful Arcane. Six other sacrifices are also required. First a gate framework is created. Next a special crystal is placed in the horns of the <a href="..\items\souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a> and it is used in the preparation rituals. During these rituals the other six are sacrificed one at a time and their energies forced into the crystal through the use of the Soul Eater. Once these sacrifices have been made the crystal is removed from the blade and attuned by the target Arcane. The crystal is then implanted in the forehead of the Arcane sacrifice and he is bound to it through a ritualistic death. The six original sacrifices contribute Power, Con, and Intelligence to the resulting creature. During the rituals the essences of the sacrifices cook down into the crystal and bones of the Arcane. These bones are then placed into a gate framework and another series of rituals are performed  to create the Hell Gate. A final set of rituals bind the gate, creature, and gate framework into one. The spirit of the creature becomes the gate controller. Another part of it splits off and becomes a wraith-like being that guards the gate and controller.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The bones of the Arcane are placed into the gate framework with the skull placed behind the key stone. The other bones are used to frame the opening.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Hand has found additional magics that allow him to create binding and controlling spells when the gate is being created. This places the guardian under his control and allows him to use it as one of his minions. If the physical form of this creature is killed it will reform at its gate.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To seal a Hell Gate requires a power vs power against the guardian/controller and several spells to create the actual seal itself. These include spells to place the guardian into a form of stasis so it cannot awaken and cast spells to remove the seal. A mythryl spike is also required. This is hollowed out and the void filled with anti-magic serum and driven into the skull behind the key stone of the gate. This also helps to keep the guardian from performing any magic to break the seal. A sealed Hell Gate cannot be re-opened somewhere else. It must first be closed and then re-opened with another series of sacrifices and rituals.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Destroying a Gate Keeper</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This requires the Gate Keeper spirit to be dispelled and then all the magics bound into the gate and framework to be unwoven. There are spells available from several groups that allow the sharing/combining of power to allow enough for a chance at the power vs power required to seal or close a gate.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is another way to close a Hell Gate and destroy the Gate Keeper. This requires the use of Soul Eater. The Gate must first be prepared as if for Sealing. Once the myhtryl spike has been driven home the Gate frame must be carefully taken down. Care must be taken to insure the spike remains in contact with the skull in the key stone at all times. After the skeleton is exposed then Soul Eater must be touched to the binding crystal and a Ritual of Release incanted. Soul Eater will then suck the soul from the binding crystal and consume it in the normal way. If this is done with a new binding crystal in place the Gate Keeper's attributes are available to power the greater Dark Spells.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Gate Keepers and Soul Eater</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Keepers have a primary bond to Soul Eater. Because of this they will listen to and possibly obey the weilder of Soul Eater even if the weilder is in direct opposition to the Hand. At the point of the game and story the Hand does not know this for certain. Usually Soul Eater will possess its weilder and thus its purposes and the Hand's will be similar.</p>
