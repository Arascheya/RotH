<p class="pagecaption">Gatherers</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These are the research agents for Eternia. They are autonomous probe systems, biologically based, that are sent out into the Realms to gather data for inclusion in the <a href="../places/eternia/repository.htm">Great Repository</a> in Eternia. this is not a readily available location to the regular citizens of Eternia. The <a href="../npcs/the_author.htm">Silent Woman</a> may find it in one of her excursions with her rommmate off into the ends of the tracks beyond the regular areas of the human sections of Eternia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gatherers are parasitic, riding their hosts in a benign and often undetected way. Once a host is acquired, it can use the gathered data as part of its own memories, however, it takes enough awareness to realize the memories are there and enough concentration to link to them. Gatherers prefer medium to low intelligence sentients, mostly to avoid detection. They will enhance the biological functions of their host, removing diseases and damage to keep the host as able as possible.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They are planted by special units from Eternia on target worlds and left to gather data. They will jump hosts at the death of the current one. Return to Eternia is controlled by the Eternia side, by the <a href="keepers.htm">Keepers</a> at the <a href="../places/eternia/repository.htm">Great Repository</a>. There are four access point to the <a href="../places/eternia/repository.htm">Great Repository</a>. One is from Eternia, one is from Centrys, one is from the Void, and the fourth is a link from the Hut of All Realms that the avatar of the <a href="../gods/younger_gods.htm">Balance Keeper</a> can use.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gatherers are spider-like beings, recruited long ago. They were originally lesser demons belonging to Ishra, Demon Queen of Spiders. The <a href="../gods/younger_gods.htm">Balance Keeper</a> took them and made them neutral, then turned their care and control over to the <a href="keepers.htm">Keepers</a>.</p>
