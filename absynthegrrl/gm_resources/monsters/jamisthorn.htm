<p class="pagecaption">Jamis Thorn</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Large flowering perenial vine found in temperate forests. It produces clusters of deep violet flowers during most of the summer months and produces seed pods late in the fall. It is a hardy plant, surviving all but the hardest of frosts.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This vine produces two to three inch long thorns that contain a neurotoxin capable of paralysing up to gorilla sized targets. The paralysis is permanent and slowly leads to death after a twenty-four hour period. This poison is hard to distinguish so it is favored by assassins everywhere. There is a brisk trade in black market seeds and thorns.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The thorns are at their most potent during the seed bearing phase of the plant's life when the nutrients from the decaying victims helps to produce the most vital seeds.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is an antidote to the Jamis Thorn poison. See Pharmacom Technical Document <a href="../pharmacom/drug_treatment/jamis.htm">JT6845</a> for details.</p>
