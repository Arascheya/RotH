<p class="regtxt5">Attack: land on a victim's head and eat/disolve it away. The take over the body and morph into an appearance of the original head. The tentacles attach to the nervous system of the host body and control its actions from there. The Possessor gains all of the victim's memories and abilities.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Appearance: looks like a 4 tentacled octopus about the size of a human head.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Notes:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A Possessor can use a host body for 2 to 4 years before it wears out and needs to be replaced.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Matings, done in natural form, produce one offspring that matures in 4 years.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once a Possessor has a body it will cast a permanent illusion on itself to look like the victim. The only ways to expose a Possessor are to kill the host, get it to drink Red Moon Malt Brew, or observe the shadow cast by the glow of a charged power crystal (techno power crystal).</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They can be killed by normal attacks of by ingestion of Eye of the Beholder Bourbon, which is an instant toxin to them. When they are killed their original shape becomes visible. The host body and the Possessor then rapidly decompose into a jelly-like goo.</p>
