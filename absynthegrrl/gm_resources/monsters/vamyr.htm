<p class="pagecaption">Races of the Imperium - Vamyr</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Bat society, such as it was, was based around mother/child units. The males were usually only around during breeding seasons. Some of the more enlightened might have stayed long enough to ensure the mother’s health until the birth of the child, after that they went back to their bachelor societies. Groups of mothers would sometimes group together for child rearing. Before OutSystems Resource Development Company changed everything they had herds of blood cattle for food and a fairly evolved social structure around how it all worked. The bachelor groups would provide about half the labor for a community group in exchange for rights to blood cattle feeding and access to breeding females.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Vamyr were originally from Marwatt’s Reach and several other systems nearby. The ones from Marwatt's Reach were re-settled on Milos Hope when OutSystems determined Marwatt's Reach was resource rich and Milos Hope was not. Only about a third of the Marwatt's Reach population survived to be relocated.</p>
