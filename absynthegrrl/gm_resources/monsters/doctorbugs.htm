<p class="regtxt5">Appearance: small, 5 mm, clearish bugs with brilliantly colored insides.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Number appearing: 10d100</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Notes:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">These bugs are magical creatures that eat disease and damaged tissues. They will enter a host, crawl around, and consume the diseased and damaged tissues they find. They excrete a natural anesthetic and growth enzymes that prevent pain and promote rapid healing. This causes regular damage to heal at twice the normal rate with only a 5% chance of any infection or complications surrounding the injury or illness. These bugs can cure anything except curses or magically created diseases. They heal magical damage at half the rate of non-magical damage.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As they work the skin and tissues where they are concentrated writh eand convulse as they feed. If the patient observes this behavior a Sanity roll is required. Failure results in the loss of 1d4 Sanity Points.</p>
