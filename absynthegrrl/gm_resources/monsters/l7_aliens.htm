<p class="pagecaption">Wind of Change (Level 7 Aliens)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Based off Alien movies.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">These were developed by the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a> as a biological style war-droid. They were engineered with telepathy, a limited intelligence, and a brutal need to infect and consume any who opposed them. Their original purpose was to conquer and sanitize colony worlds. To this end they were designed to shock and awe their victims as well as contaminate and destroy them. As they survived battle and their numbers grew from their seeded victims, they mutated, developing more and more awareness and intelligence. In the end, a swarm, a sub-group of the battle brigade, returned to the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a> <a href="../places/drkzyrkth.htm">home world</a> and released the vampyrites that destroyed them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The level 7 colony was formed from survivors of the Dwarven First Holm colony. Once <a href="../npcs/elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> was alerted to their presence he killed most of them and captured the queen. His intent was to study them, then destroy them. <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Kayara</a> and <a href="../npcs/sharyl.htm">Sharyl</a> objected, arguing that they had shown enough signs of intelligence to try and communicate with.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In the end a compromise was reached. The aliens were allowed to colonize Level 7 and a supply chain of food was arranged to keep them from boiling out to find more. The queen agreed to a population cap.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Over the centuries <a href="../npcs/sharyl.htm">Sharyl</a> and the queen improved the species through manipulation until a diversified colony was formed. Now it has about as much diversity as an isolated human colony. Some have even learned the arcane arts.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">One of the abilities gain has been a modified Hold spell. This spell will render any target completely imobile but still able to think and speak.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The society breaks down into warriors, arcanes, engineers, general workers, and the queen. Control is still mostly a hive colony style with the queen having final authority. The system supports enough autonomy that groups can be sent out on tasks away from Level 7 and there are no issues with unexpected incidents.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../npcs/elentaryn.htm">Elentaryn</a> can employ members of the colony for his needs at the consent of the queen. He cannot compel them without risking open warfare with the colony. It would be a war he would be likely to lose. The colony has enough understanding of the systems and mechanisms of the Labyrinth to easily take control of it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../npcs/tyana.htm">Tyana</a> was a trusted friend of the colony when she was part of the mainframe. She has maintained some contact with them after joining the <a href="../../hut_online/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a> crew. Irena has gifted the queen with a <a href="">Hut Summoning Gem</a> in a gesture of friendship.</p>
