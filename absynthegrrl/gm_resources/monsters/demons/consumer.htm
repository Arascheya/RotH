<p class="pagecaption">Consumer Demon</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This demon is a disembodied spirit that will bond with a living host. It seeks to consume energy and thoughts from beings near its host. It will do this through PWR vs PWR attacks directly against the target unless it can persuade its host to kill and eat the target. It prefers the kill and consume method because this gives it both the spirit and the flesh of the target.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The target of the energy and thought eating recovers quickly when removed from the influence of the demon. They will often have improved mental capabilities if they were not eaten down too far. The symptoms of demonic feeding mimic several common drugs used to improve pliability in the target. It takes a demonic adept to recognize the difference. A talented alchemist will sometimes catch this effect as well because all the usual drugs have side-effects during the decontamination phase.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The only known way to remove a Consumer is to force it out of the host and into a <a href="../../items/binding_crystal.htm">Gem of Holding and Binding</a> through spirit combat. There is great risk in this for once the demon is clear of the original host, it will immediately seek a new one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is another, more drastic way. This involves fitting a <a href="../../items/binding_crystal.htm">Gem of Holding and Binding</a> onto <a href="../../items/souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a> and using <a href="../../items/souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a> to kill the host.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some places will use a Consumer Demon as part of their adept training. An infect host will be placed in proximity to the adept and the adept forced to continue their training while the demon feeds on them. When they are taken away from the demonic drain they instantly perform at a higher level because of having to fight against the drain while training.</p>
