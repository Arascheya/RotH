<p class="pagecaption">Demon - Succubus</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Realms of the Hut Data</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These female demons are usually not found in numbers, for they prefer to act alone. A succubus in its natural form appears very much like a tall and very beautiful human female - although the bat-like wings immediately show the observer its true character. Succubi cannot be harmed by any sort of normal weaponry. Succubus can cause darkness in a 5' radius. The kiss of the succubus drains the victim of one energy level, and all succubi are able to perform any one of the following feats at will: Become ethereal (as if using the oil of that name), charm person, ESP, clairaudience, suggestion (as the spell), or shape change (to any humanoid form of approximately their own height and weight only).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Succubi come from the 666th layer of the Abyss. They are a matriarchal society, ruled by the queen/mother. The mother is determined by ability as a succubus and trustworthiness within her society.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Succubi hunt alone, using stealth and seduction.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Succubi reproduce by selecting a desired father, then letting him impregnate them. They are only fertile when they desire to be. All other sexual contact will have no risk of pregnancy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Maladatha, the current queen/mother, has holdings in the Discord. These are next to the Asylum holdings and Home 0 of the Hut. The queen/mother can trace her ancestry back to <a href="../../npcs/iskandera.htm">Arascheya ni Iskandera</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Until the time of Iskandera, the succubi were scattered across several different layers and were controlled by various other demonic lords and ladies. Iskandera unified them and brought them to their current home on the 666th layer. Shortly after the unification began to break down, with one particlar "family" of succubi, the Maldethra, working to overthrow Iskandera. She was forced to flee when pregnant with Arascheya. Arascheya, working with various allies, returned to the 666th and regained control, expelling the Maldethra offspring and executing the leading matriarchs. She had learned more than her mother about how to set up and maintain a power base. Her changes kept the succubi community mostly unified and happy. She passed the skills on and they have had adecent society ever since. Many succubi consider it a mark of extreme pride and fortune to be descended from Arascheya, many taking names ending with "ni Arascheya", daughter of Arascheya.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Description:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Beautiful  and seductive, the succubi  are the temptresses of mortals. Whereas the glabrezu tempt men of power,  the succubi choose men of passion  and energy.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Succubi appear most often polymorphed into stunningly beautiful women with perfect figures and smooth, milky  skin. They may also appear as any demihuman race. However, they do not often deal with demihumans, because humans’ fiery nature makes  them easier prey.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Succubi look more tanar’ric in their true  form: that of a beautiful woman with large wings and sinister, glowing eyes. Succubi can speak  the language of  their victims. They also communicate using telepathy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Combat:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Succubi are never surprised. They are not warriors. When pressed,  they defend themselves, but flee when possible. When  trapped, they can attack with  two fists (ld3 damage each).</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Succubi are affected only by +2  or better weapons. they are immune to all fire-based  attacks, magical or otherwise.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">The kiss of a succubi drains energy from its victim, causing the loss of one level of life energy. The succubus lures a mortal man  into activities  of passion  and then drains energy from him.  Even  after a drain, the heat of the moment  is so strong that most men do not notice  (Wisdom check  at -4 penalty to notice each drain). If  he  fails the check, he continues, heedless  of danger.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">In  addition  to those available to all tanar’ri, succubi also have  the following  spell-like  powers: become ethereal  (as if using oil of  etherealness), charm person,  clairaudience, ESP, plane shift, shapechange  (to a humanoid  form of about their own height and weight), and suggestion. They can also attempt to gate in  1 balor once per day with a 40% chance of success.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Habitat/Society:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">The temptresses of  the Lower Planes are subtle and slow. They seduce mortals with their charms, ultimately killing them and taking their life forces to the Abyss.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Succubi act independently of tanar’ri society. They work of their own volition  and ultimately  answer  to no one. The greater and true tanar’ri seem content with this situation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ecology:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">The destruction of mortals increases the power of the Abyss. With this power the succubi aid the eternal war effort of the tanar’ri, who therefore tolerate them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Incubus</p>
<p class="regtxt9">lncubi are the male counterparts  to succubi, hut they are far less common. These creatures travel to the Prime Material Plane to tempt  female mortals.  These creatures always appear as the most perfect male specimen of whatever race  they are tempting. However, succubi and incubi do not mate to perpetuate their kind.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">It is uncertain why there are more succubi than incubi. Sages suggest that mortal men are far more susceptible to the temptations of beauty than are women.</p>
