<p class="pagecaption">Belgezyeleth</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These are a symbiotic cluster of two demonic types. The Belgezyeleth itself is the master or host for the parasitic feeders that it uses to sustain itself. It spreads its essence into each of its feeders, so it cannot be killed until all the feeders are dead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Yelgezeth are the feeders that feed energy to a Belgezyeleth. A Belgezyeleth will have between four and twelve feeders depending on its station within the Belgezyelethian society. Feeders consume terror from other beings and feed that to their host. Yelgezeth appear as very thin, tall beings with long, sharp, twisted faces. Long claws protrude from stubby fingers. They have long, almost prehensile tongues, flat black and dead looking eyes, and breath that smells of rotting blood. They are hard to kill without magic and fairly heavy duty magic at that. They hunt alone, prefering to ambush their prey in dark corners and suck the fear out of them, until there is nothing left and the target is an empty, dessicated husk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Belgezyelethian society is intolerant of Belgezyeleth that have lost their feeders. It is the supreme disgrace to have to return and attempt to claim new feeders from the breeding pits in the Belgezyelethian home plane in the Abyss.</p>
