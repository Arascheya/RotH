<p class="regtxt5">Description:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Tieflings  are the offspring of  the planes, as varied as the places they call home. Superficially human, their appearance always betrays them:  some sport small horns,  other have pointed ears, scales,  a cloven hoof, or  just a wicked  gleam in their eye that never leaves. What they all have in common is a quick temper and a chip on their shoulder. They’re often confused with alu-fiends, erinyes,  incubi,  and succubi  (which they’ll  forgive), but  never call a tiefling a bastard  or a half-breed. He’ll  take it personal-like. Plane-touched  is the word, or "sir" or "lady".</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Tieflings prefer dark clothing:  a  shade of maroon  like clotted blood, dark forest green, blue  as dark as lapis,  and a midnight black that absorbs all  light are their favorite colors. Their clothing is almost always a tight-fitting set of leggings, a vest, and tunic, combined with  a loose flowing cape or long jacket with  tails. They don’t seem to walk  so much  as slither, and a basher never wants to see one  in  a rage-the howls are louder than Pandemonium and more dangerous than  the Tenth Pit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Combat:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Tieflings are determined, stubborn, wily, and  occasionally berserk warriors  and talented mages. All tieflings gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence and Charisma, and suffer a -1 penalty to Strength and Wisdom. All tieflings have infravision to 60  and can create darkness 15’  radius once per day. Mage tieflings prefer spells like burning hands, unseen servant,  blur, deeppockets, haste, fear,  and domination. Tiefling priests are well  known  for employing protection from  good,  enthrall, flame walk,  and undetectable lie spells,  though  the Powers that grant these spells usually remain nameless. All  tieflings suffer only half damage from cold and gain  a +2  to saving throws versus  fire, electricity, and poison.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Because tieflings are not a brawny race, their weapons are light and quick, depending on speed and sharpness to make up for what  they lack in weight and raw  cleaving power. Despite its fragile appearance, tiefling weaponry is exceptionally deadly, not  least because it is often poisoned. Typical weapons include the long sword, stiletto, throwing dagger, long spear, ranseur, hand crossbow, and  scimitar. Punch daggers are also popular. Because almost half of all tieflings  are ambidextrous,
many fight in a two-handed  style. Few tiefling warriors carry shields, prefering to rely on a form of well-crafted scale armor made from the hide of Lower Planar vermin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Habitat/Society:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Tieflings have no true society of their own; they are the outcasts of the planes, cast out of the Lower Planes, not trusted in  the upper planes. Though many of  them gather in Sigil,  just as many others try to carve out a home in their own planes. They don’t trust others (what orphan does?), but their self-confidence  is nothing short of astounding:  a tiefling  is said to have swum the River Styx because no one told  him he  couldn’t, and another climbed to the fifth heaven of Mount Celestia before  the archons noticed him  lurking among the shadows and cast him  into the Abyss.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Tieflings have a reputation  as great but deceitful  lovers. Their  fickleness  in affairs of  the heart  is legendary, and seems closely bound  to their  reputation  as tricksters, liars, and frauds. Tiefling gamblers rarely find planars  to fleece; they depend  on  the clueless and the young  to line their pockets.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Though  tieflings  are usually  loners, a  charismatic  and powerful  tiefling sometimes gains a  small  following of  like-minded, young tieflings who hope to ride his coattails. These packs are called "schools",  though they  teach hard  lessons. Each  school serves  to glorify its founder and protect its members-it does  little else. Some schools operate  as informal thieves’ guilds,  others are mage’s societies, but almost all  of  them collapse when  the  founder dies.  Some of  them are remembered,  like the School of Sergory, which  has  continued  in a way, but with most of them even  the name dies. Sergory was a master thief and mage, and other schools
somtimes take his name  to  inflate their own  importance. How  (or even whether) Sergory met his end is dark, and best kept that way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ecology:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Tieflings are often persecuted by humans and others; "If there’s blame, find a tiefling", "Don’t ever make a bet with a tiefling", and "If a tiefling didn’t do it, he was just pressed for time" are common sayings in Sigil. Naturally, this makes tieflings a little defensive around others, but it doesn’t make them band  together,  as it might for other oppressed races.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Good tieflings  are doubly committed  to their cause, as if trying to make up  for the race’s bad reputation. Tieflings prefer to eat only meat, blood, bone, and marrow, preferably  raw. They enjoy balaena blubber, gristle,  and even roasted  insects, which most races find disturbing. They drink strange concoctions of broth. oil. sulphur, and firewater, though they'll hoist an ale with any bubber in Sigil if nothing else is available. When meat is unavailable, they can live for short periods on ashes, coal, and other mineral matter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As Player Characters:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">In the multiverse, few creatures are of pure lineage, and even fewer are what they seem to be. That’s  the greatest truth of the tiefling’s existence. It’s not advisable to ask a  tiefling about his or her ancestors, as the answer wouldn’t likely be pleasant. Part human and part something else, tieflings  are the orphans of the planes. They can be described as humans who’ve been plane-touched. A shadow of knife-edge  in their face, a little too much fire in their eyes, a scent of ash in their presence  -  all these things and more describe a  tiefling. No planar would mistake a tiefling for a human, and most primes make  the mistake only once. Tieflings live with both pride and shame of who and what they are. They have no culture of  their own, and most are loners, which  fits their background. Some slip into the edges of human society, becoming poets and artists who describe the corrupt fringes of the respectable world. Adventurous types often spend their years probing the unexplored edges of the multiverse, be it to survey strange lands or experiment in the forgotten niches of magical science.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Humans don’t trust tieflings (and deep inside they fear them), but they remain inexplicably fascinated by tieflings  just the same. The plane-touched are often accused of secret plots and awful alliances - mostly without a shred of proof -  because of who and what they are. A tiefling learns early that life is unfair and hard. His reaction is to fight back and never let his foes see the pain. Other people, even other tieflings,  simply aren’t viewed as allies and often are automatically considered enemies. A tiefling doesn’t take a friend until he learns the measure  of his companion, and even then he’ll never fully trust anyone. "I watch my own back", is an old tiefling quip. They maintain no hereditary blood-feuds, but  tieflings take care of  themselves without any thought of others’ problems.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Tiefling characters gain a +1 bonus on Intelligence and Charisma scores, but suffer a -1 penalty to Strength and Wisdom. Tieflings can be of any alignment save lawful good. They also gain a number of special abilities, based on  their mysterious heritage: They possess infravision  to a range of 60 feet and have the ability to create darkness,  15-foot  radius once per day. Tieflings suffer only half damage from cold-based  attacks, and they gain a +2 bonus  to all saving throws vs. fire, electricity, or poison.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Tieflings can be fighters, rangers, wizards (including specialist mages), priests, thieves,  or bards. They may also pursue multiclass options,  including fighter/wizard,  fighter/priest, fighter/thief, wizard/thief, and priest/thief. Teiflings can reach level 14 as wizards,  15 as rogues,  10 as priests,  and  12 as fighters. Single-class  characters can exceed  these  limits by two levels.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Tiefling  thieves make  the following racial adjustments to their thief abilities:<br/>
PP OL  F/RT  MS  HS  DT  CW  RL <br/>
-- --  +5%  +  10%  +  10%  - -  +5%</p>
