<p class="regtxt5">Another of the female demons with a multi-armed female torso atop the body of a great snake. Type V demons are taller than a large man and far more terrible. Their six arms are all able to use weapons. The favored weapons are swords and battle axes. They can constrict a victim with their snake tails as well. When desiring to do so, they cause darkness in a 5' radius. Other extraordinary abilities, any one of which can be performed as desired are: charm person, levitate (as an 11th level magic-user), read languages, detect invisible object, cause pyrotechnics, <a href="../../info/arcanes/spells/order04/order04.htm#poly">polymorph self</a>, project image, and gate in a type I (30% chance), type II (25% chance), type 111 (15% chance), type IV (15% chance), type VI (10% chance), or one of the lords or princes (5%); but the chance of successfully opening such a gate is a mere 50%.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lower level demons greatly fear the domineering and cruel type V demons. All of these creatures have names that can be used to aid in negotiations. Demons of this type are likely to desire the sacrifice of strong warriors to them.</p>
