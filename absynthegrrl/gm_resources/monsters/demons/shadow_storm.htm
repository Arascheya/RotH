<p class="pagecaption">Shadow Storm</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These beings are mostly non-corporeal energy. They feed off the terror and fear brought about by dangerous and terrifying weather. To this end they can summon and control storms over a large area. They are highly intelligent, solitary, and considered a demon lord in terms of passage through HellGates.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Shadow Storm builds in power as it consumes energy from living things around it. With each life consumed it grows in ferocity and in its ability to call weather to provide more food.</p>
