<p class="regtxt5">Description:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Alu-fiends, the horrid female offspring of  succubus and human, look like comely human females with attractive, powerful features.  Only their sharp, upsloping eyebrows and wings indicate the truth.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Alu-fiends usually communicate using telepathy, but can sometimes speak additional languages.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Combat:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Alu-fiends have an innate intuition  that warns them of  impending danger 75% of the time. They have no natural attack  forms save fists and teeth  (normal human  damage). About  750/0 of  them  carry enchanted weapons,  often gifts from  their  evil mothers. These weapons are most likely of common make (i.e. +1, +2, etc.), but there is a  15% chance for a special weapon. The fiend relies heavily on a special weapon and never willingly parts with  it.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Alu-fiends can restore their own bit points at the expense of their opponents.  This requires a  normal melee hit  (ld8 damage, of which the alu-fiend gets half,  rounded up).</p>
<p class="regtxt9">These creatures have base Armor Class 5, the heritage of their unnatural mother. Enchanted armor or protective items can improve the base AC. As with weapons, 75% of ah-fiends wear enchanted armor of common make (+ 1, +2, etc.). There is a 5% chance such armor is special (e.g. plate mail of etherealness, etc.).</p>
<p class="regtxt9">choose appropriate items from the tables on For both magical armor and weapons, pages 139-140 of the DMG.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">In addition to those available to all tanar’ri, all alu-fiends, regardless of intelligence, have the following spell-like powers: charm person, dimension door  (once per day), ESP, shape change  (to a humanoid form of approximately their own height and weight only), and suggestion.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">All alu-fiends  have  infravision  to 240‘. Alu-fiends  are affected only by cold-wrought iron or magical weapons.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Fully  10% of alu-fiends have Genius intelligence; they have all the spell-like powers of their sisters and are also actual mages. Genius alu-fiends  are  1st- to  12th-level mages with  full spell ability and can choose spells  from  any school. Genius alu-fiends are never specialist wizards.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Habitat/Society:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Alu-fiends tend to be hateful, even by tanar’ri standards, because of  their dual nature. They view themselves as outcasts,  neither  human  or tanar’ri. Other tanar’ri view them  the same way,  as lowly and without purpose.  Only the alu-fiends’ power keeps them  in contention as a lesser tanar’ri race.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ecology:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">If  an alu-fiend  can somehow hide her wings,  she  is mistaken for a human 70% of the time.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Interestingly, about 20% of alu-fiends are chaotic neutral or true neutral  in alignment. This usually occurs when a succubus mates with  a non-evil  human and the offspring retains a hint of her  father’s morality.</p>
