<p class="regtxt5">Riders originally were a lesser form of spider demon under the control of <a href="../../npcs/ishra.htm">Ishra</a>. They are a variant of the <a href="../gatherers.htm">Gatherers</a> she shared with the <a href="../../npcs/irena_k.htm">Balance Keeper</a>. They were used to provide comfort and stability to the people healed by the Ihra Temples after severe emotional and physical traumas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now they are a perverted and nasty creature that <a href="../../npcs/aztol.htm">Aztol</a> uses for keeping has various servants and captives under control. A Rider Demon is implanted in the skull of the target and then it controls them based on the parameters it is given before insertion. These commands can be updated or changed using a special wand that allows the holder to communicate directly with the implanted demon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rider Demons are especially suceptible to <a href="../../places/shardra_s/shardra_drinks.htm#8legs">Eight Legs Liquor</a>. It will render them comatose before the host passes out, allowing the host a small amount of freedom.</p>
