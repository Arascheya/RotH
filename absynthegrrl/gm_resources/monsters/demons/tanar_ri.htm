<p class="regtxt5">Description:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">In Sigil the streets teem with denizens of a  thousand planes, and each claims  to have visited  a  thousand more. In  every back-alley  gambling haunt  in the Lower Ward,  in half  the tiefling halfway houses, in  the  incense-heavy  air of vapor shops where  old men  debate weird  philosophies, tales pass back and forth. Those tales debate the absolutes of the Outer Planes, the greatest and  least, loftiest and most base, best  and worst. Every tale that turns upon  the worst  inevitably stops with  the place of despair,  the  infinite bleak  layers that  represent the suffering and  toil of existence made tangible. There chaos and hopelessness reign.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">There in the Abyss, where others endure endless torment, the tanar’ri thrive.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Like the baatezu, tanar’ri  are fiends (lower planar  creatures of enormous power), but they embody evil of a different type. Baatezu, lawful evil eings, pursue calculated doctrines as part of a grand plan  to advance their race to dominion of all the planes. Most baatezu tempt mortals  into  intellectual evils such as pride,  ambition, and subversion. Tanar’ri, chaotic evil personified, are motivated not by doctrines but by insane, violent  inner drives.  They tempt mortals  into crimes of passion and vice, evils of appetite. Less intelligent tanar’ri often attack without question and  fight until slain. True and greater tanar’ri roam  the Astral  and Ethereal planes, driven  ceaselessly to seek fresh victims.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">All  tanar’ri have a  form of  telepathy that lets them communicate with any intelligent life form regardless of language barriers. Tanar’ri with Average or better Intelligence can converse.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">The Abyss-forged  magical weapons of  the tanar’ri dissolve upon the owner’s death. When one doesn’t, the weapon probably originated elsewhere.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Combat:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">All tanar’ri (even  the least) share  the spell-like powers darkness,  15‘ radius, infravision, and teleport without  error. They also can gate in other tanar’ri  at will, as defined for each type. Tanar’ri are affected by attack forms as noted below:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">These classifications actually mean little in their lives. They are merely broad estimates of destructive power. The tanar’ri have little use for anything besides power, and  a  strong lesser tanar’ri who bests a greater cousin gains higher status in  the Abyss. Their petty battles  for position are endless. The only class free from  these power struggles is the molydeus, a  guardian tanar’ri  that seems curiously divorced from the tanar’ri power structure.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">The tanar’ri are one of the two major factions in the Blood War. For as long as the tanar’ri have existed, they have waged war against their ancient  enemies, the baatezu. The tanar’ri and baatezu wage war  in  strikingly different ways.  The baatezu are organized and  fight their battles with planned tactics for strategic goals. The tanar’ri, however, are a horde of chaos  and disorder, using their endless numbers  in wars of attrition.  It  is difficult to estimate tanar’ri populations, considering they inhabit an infinite number of infinitely  large planes, but there are easily  100  times as many tanar’ri as baatezu.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">This disordered  race wages the Blood War only because true tanar’ri seem to have a primal  urge  to destroy baatezu. They  force those less powerful than  themselves  to  serve their wishes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ecology:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Most tanar’ri feed on either flesh or the  life force of other living beings. It appears that they derive more nutrition from a victim by instilling  terror in it before the kill. Whereas most predators simply stalk and then kill, tanar’ri add a third step: stalk, terrify, kill. </p>
