<p class="pagecaption">Habyaniasha (Desert Skimmer)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Habyanisha, desert skimmers, are giant beetle-like insects, up to the length of 10 feet, that skim across the desert and eat anything they can find, including the water-fat bipeds they find at the edge of the habaya. They are a source of many useful resources, including a form of scale armor made from their carapaces. Habyanisha can survive all but the harshest of desert storms while remaining in the open. Habyanisha is a singular and plural term. Habyanisha meat is edible, with the flesh of the young being sweet and tender. The flesh of older specimens is tough and less flavorful. Eggs are good as food and extremely valuable for trade, if fertilized. Habyanisha are trainable to the level of a clever war dog and are more devastating in that role. Legend has it the first habyanisha came from a mad mage's experimentation in the lost empire of Kharatoum.</p>
