<p class="pagecaption">Campaign Notes - Current Campaign</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Hut</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The players, at some point, will come across a chest containing enough copper rings for the party. These are the hut master key and companion rings. Pag's ring will be the one to transform into the Hut key - want her to be the Controller - Bill would likely have the best fun with it. Until they arrive at the hut, the items will look just like when they were found. The only change will be the party will be unable to let go of the items and each non-controller will find one of the copper rings in their pocket. When they arrive in the Linking room, the items will reveal their true nature and open the door to the hut clone they will be assigned to.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Players need to find three crystals for the hut power systems before it will be capable of operation. access to the Star Stone, the Hut Control Gems, requires the Tears of Kharatoum. These are scattered about the Lotus Empire.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Current Things - for current sessions</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ivan will notice a group of people in the Jewel that he has seen around town. everywhere they go, they are asking questions about the city, the school, and the power blocks of the city. they seem vaguely threatening and dangerous - he notices they are in the Jewel and watching the Riverwind crew intently.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kara revealed much of her background, but always in the context of her pain and the terror of the empirial wars with the razaks. Irena disappeared, she says she has not seen Irena since her disappearance - decide if she was lying or if Irena hasn't come back</p>

<p class="regtxt5">perhaps Carnival near Frenlayish?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">nobility and merchanters in Azkelon are getting more serious about the power struggles - nobility are wanting to secure more, merchanters aren't wanting to relinquish any</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the young Tolaz has come on the scene with a large private army. where he came from and how he raised his army is not known. he is forming alliances with many of the other noble houses.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">five guys Pag is talking to - would they be hirable or are they just skids</p>

<p class="regtxt5">rumors to be heard:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Tolaz searching for something</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dark Carnival appearing - fortells large events - make this a conversation - one person arguing it is a portent, the other, it's just a carnival</p>

<p class="regtxt12">speaker 1 - down on his luck looking man</p>

<p class="regtxt15">i'm telling you, the Dark Carnival fortells desperate times.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">speaker 2 - dock worker</p>

<p class="regtxt15">it's just a carnival</p>

<p class="regtxt12">speaker 3 - a better dressed fellow</p>

<p class="regtxt15">and a kind of boring one at that. many of the arcanes from that school in miskaton could do better</p>

<p class="regtxt12">speaker 1 - down on his luck looking man</p>

<p class="regtxt15">no, really, every time it has come through here, strange things have happened</p>

<p class="regtxt12">speaker 2 - dock worker</p>

<p class="regtxt15">right, you mean like your wife running away with it?</p>

<p class="regtxt12">speaker 1 - down on his luck looking man</p>

<p class="regtxt15">more than that. it came when the Hell Gate Wars started, it came when the Tolaz pup returned. it's a dark omen</p>

<p class="regtxt9">people disappearing in the northern parts of the valley</p>

<p class="regtxt9">nobles banding together</p>

<p class="regtxt9">merchanters nervous</p>

<p class="regtxt9">(need some player doable items - even if they don't take any of them)</p>

<p class="regtxt12">guards needed for shipments to the Ancients Way and the High Valley</p>

<p class="regtxt12">deck hands for a river vessel</p>

<p class="regtxt12">adventurers wanted to explore dwarf mines</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Tolaz recruiting guards and new tennat-farmers for the family holdings</p>

<p class="regtxt12">merchanters recruiting</p>

<p class="regtxt5">think about the fact they have been waving cash around in the Hook and Line - it has been noticed</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kheron</p>

<p class="regtxt9">knows some of the back story on the Tolaz family - TOLD to Pag</p>

<p class="regtxt12">the Froys investigated the village and mansion after the purge</p>

<p class="regtxt12">found the closed access point for the working tube train - several bodies near it and bloody hand prints on the control gems</p>

<p class="regtxt12">was not aware of the branch of the family Aztol came from</p>

<p class="regtxt12">knows very little about Tolaz the younger</p>

<p class="regtxt9">considers the carnival to be just a carnival, but it does have some magic appeal</p>

<p class="regtxt12">mentions concept of "ever want to step into a fantasy for a little while? the carnival lets you do that"</p>

<p class="regtxt12">knows of several wives and daughters that have run away with the carnival to escape bad things at home</p>

<p class="regtxt9">has some contact with shippers</p>

<p class="regtxt9">the five guys - doesn't know much about them, but they seem reasonable enough in the tavern</p>

<p class="regtxt9">should have a short mission for Pag and others - stealth mission, recover something or some intell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the five guys</p>

<p class="regtxt9">have worked as caravan guards in the north east, through the dwarf mines to the High Valley</p>

<p class="regtxt9">could be persuaded, but work as a group</p>

<p class="regtxt5">85 zeems from Azkelon to Frenleyish - 4.25 days</p>

<p class="regtxt5">154 zeems from Frenlayish to Stratmore - 8 days</p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider Lost Dharma Initiative kinds of thiings - remember, Elentaryn is a shadow master in this incarnation and would definitely be into that entire watch and manipulate from the shadows kind of action. the Froys could have found one or more monitoring stations</p>

<p class="regtxt9">sewers and tunnels link various cells of the city. these are sometimes closed when a particularly noteworthy event brings them to the public eye. almost immediately a new connection is opened</p>

<p class="regtxt9">the Froys were involved in opening one recently that revealed a strange shaft - they had their arcane cast an illusion on it to make it look like an old well.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">with the activities surrounding the Tolaz group, they don't have the resources to investigate this find and ask the players to take a look</p>

<p class="regtxt9">this is in reality one of Elentaryn's  monitoring stations and old Sphynx path clues. the shaft goes up to the Azkelon monitoring station and branches to various buildings in the city. the shaft drops to a ring door to the tube train station for the Sphynx Path. there is a coridor up to the basement of a tavern where the sphynx is located. it is in a secret room that hasn't been accessed since the Hell Gate Wars. the people that knew about this room died in the wars.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">the sewers and under-tunnels are the home to the poorer section of the populace. ever since the Merchanters Council started cleaning up the streets a couple of generations ago, the beggars, homeless, and extremely poor moved into the under areas. Taking over ruined cellars and tunnels to create small enclaves scattered under the city. some areas are reasonably safe, others are pretty rough and wild. travel through the under-tunnels can be somewhat hazzardous if the traveller is unaware of the various zones.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">what are the politics of the under-tunnels WRT the Froys and the mission for the adventurers - i.e. - who is friendly, who owes who favors, etc.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">send to Bill before next game time - also summary of data:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">shaft found, camo'd as well, in common area, some presence from above at known cross-connects, but no serious interest by the surface groups if their attention isn't invokdeed</p>

<p class="regtxt12">start google doc about valley, stratmore, etc. and share with Bill for now, so he can add additional ideas to it</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Elentaryn should send a repair team to the monitoring station. this would be a swarm of creatures from level 7 with the tech and magik tools to repair and secure the facilities. However, is this the place to reveal these beasties?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">thieves or other factions - should have an argument going about whether to continue supporting the Froys or switch to Tolaz - this should be a static conversation overheard as the party approaches a larger settled area in the tunnels</p>

<p class="regtxt9">REMEMBER - under-tunnels are smoky, smelly, and cramped in lots of places. not all areas can afford arcane lighting and conveniences</p>

<p class="regtxt9">consider implanted something in either Asad or Gamino or both - if feeling nice, can have one malfunction and alert them</p>

<p class="regtxt9">once they enter the surveilance site, have a small group of Tolaz flunkies stumble across the magic masking. the party should hear noises from behind them before they are completely surprised. they will have to decide what to do with the Tolaz guys - let them live, kill them, etc. - before they report back about what they have found. if things go too far south, the repair swarm can arrive to help with the final phases</p>

<p class="regtxt9">in tt, headed to rendezvous with alien queen - total travel in tube train 54.5 hours - 2.75 days</p>

<p class="regtxt12">what will queen ask</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Spies of Tolaz, what do you have to say in your defence before your sentence is decreed?</p>

<p class="regtxt15"></p>

<p class="regtxt12">what will queen reveal</p>

<p class="regtxt15"></p>

<p class="regtxt12">she will release them, unless something tragically stupid occurs</p>

<p class="regtxt5">need to get Stephanos into the mix</p>

<p class="regtxt9">what are his current loyalties?</p>

<p class="regtxt12">did he ally with the Insane One after the hell gate Wars, with Kayara, remain a separate concern?</p>

<p class="regtxt12">would not have attached to Tolaz or The Hand</p>

<p class="regtxt9">what are his current resources?</p>

<p class="regtxt12">based at Temple of the Frogs</p>

<p class="regtxt12">has group of followers</p>

<p class="regtxt12">does he know that the Razak Master Ring is held by a liche somewhere on Zeltrop?</p>

<p class="regtxt12">what are his current capabilities with regard to space travel, in-atmo flight, surface transport?</p>

<p class="regtxt15">is he aware of the main section of Ghost Wind in orbit and did he track Irena's crash?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hive Queen will alert Kayara and Sharyl of the encounter - could prompt interesting side effects at school for Garaze - play this up - they are returning to the TT in the School grounds, the headmistress will have something to say about it</p>

<p class="regtxt9">what small adventures to send them on now? can't really send them to Stratmore now. Something for Riverwind? Something for headmistress?</p>

<p class="regtxt12">send note to Pag from sister - given to Lucy to give to her</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Gamino</p>

<p class="regtxt15">friends wonder where he's been, mention more strangers in the shadows, and several acquaintences have gone missing when they got too close</p>

<p class="regtxt15">a few other friends have gone missing in the swamps to the north of the city. this is near the area where Pag's mother was killed by the shadow storm four years ago</p>

<p class="regtxt15">there is a small group of people feeding it. one of them had found notes about how to provide for and strengthen a shadow storm by drowning victims in its rain squalls. now the storm has gained enough power to no longer require help, however, the feeders are still providing targets to curry favor.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">the weapons trade has spiked in the poorer sections of town, as have the deliveries of smuggled drugs and poisons - including a new, rather nasty one known as Xtaze. It is highly addictive and nearly impossible to kick. it is fatal in a fairly short term as well</p>

<p class="regtxt15">weird mummblings from the people hired as guards on caravans to the high valley in the north.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">a friend overheard a Seer in the market - something is stiring in the dwarven tunnels and the Ancients Way, something dark.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">lights have been seen in an abandoned place in westport - Setphanos and a small team come to research the Onemind startup. Stephanos has felt the stirings of the new incarnation because of his tie-ins from the past and has come to find and stop it</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Gamino or friend finds Janice, dead for a long time, in the northern swamps - need some type of identifying item for Sayna to recognize.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Pag</p>

<p class="regtxt15">sister will come to find her - some strange shake up is going on in the nobility and she is worried about the outcome. several merchant families have been attacked by assassins and had shipments destroyed, not stolen. someone poisoned a delivery of wine from her family and several members of a prominant merchanter family died as a result.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">may have to find mom's old hiding place for her secret stuff - she will have had one Pag doesn't know about - if decide to help Goraze. in the hiding place should be something about the Hut and about the place where she found the item that caused her death - this location should be hard to find, requiring Pag to research and then the party to work through some tricky traps and dangerous areas to arrive at the cache</p>

<p class="regtxt15">the place should be some type of temple or shrine to something truly dark and cthonian, something that slipped through the Hell gates some time in the past and was bound into a prison. Pag's mom accidentally released it - should have some Dark Forces clues - not too many and not too detailed, but enough to bring it into the mix, include the <a href="info/languages/lang_destruct.htm">Language of the Destructor</a> <a href="../common/story_images/rosetta_texts.png">Rozetta Stone</a> and the final section of the <a href="../common/story_images/rite_txt.png">Rite of Binding</a>, used with <a href="items/souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a>. there should be some indication that persons were sent to find <a href="items/souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a> for use by the beings the dark being was using as servants. there should also be some missed warning about not opening the casket that contained the bound creature, the texts, and several soul gems.</p>

<p class="regtxt18">this should be a treasure hunt - first find mom's stash near the Failed Mage, this will point to a larger cache somewhere else in the city, protected by various traps and the like, and this second cache will have the info on where mom went on her final exploration. the final location is where the thing was released.</p>

<p class="regtxt18">the second cache will have one Star Powered Mage gem, the <a href="info/languages/lang_destruct.htm">Language of the Destructor</a> <a href="../common/story_images/rosetta_texts.png">Rozetta Stone</a>, the final section of the <a href="../common/story_images/rite_txt.png">Rite of Binding</a>, and the scraps referencing <a href="items/souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a></p>

<p class="regtxt18">the final location is a two-fold find - the first  section is an old temple to Ishra as the goddess of life, the second is the vault where the demon-thing was bound. the Ishra priestesses bound a cthonian demon after it slipped in through a Hell Gate during the last Hell Gate War. (not the one of current history, but the one prior to that) the prison chamber is the remains of the dark temple where it was summoned.</p>

<p class="regtxt18"></p>

<p class="regtxt20">Note and <a href="items/souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a> scraps - vault at Failed Mage - Exit our house through the south tunnels and go to the second left corridor. Count the bricks between the far side of the second left and the next right, divide by three, then count that many bricks forward. In the ceiling, push up the center stone and turn it no more than 85 degrees left. Otherwise it is trapped. Pull the forward ring half way across the opening and wait for the right side stone to slide open. Reach directly in, avoiding any contact with the opening and the first few inches of the hole. At the very back will be more information.</p>

<p class="regtxt20">Note and <a href="../common/story_images/rite_txt.png">Rite of Binding</a> - in stash from previous note - Take the nobility section exit from our basement to the deepest section of tunnels. There are several traps in the lowest section you will need to watch for. They are all based on the things I have shown you. Beyond these is a section I've never shown you, where there are ladders up to a section of cellars no longer reachable from the surface. In the one farthest back from the tunnels is a chest, locked with a strange gem lock. I think it must have been in that room for years because the iron is red with rust and the dust is caked thick around it. The secret to the lock is push the gems in the following order: violet, green, red, yellow, indigo, blue, orange, and then the obsidian orb under the dragon's fangs. Be very careful with this and if you fail in the sequence wait at least a quarter of a candle before trying again or the dragon fangs will inject poison when you attempt to open the lock. Inside is the last note and the key to the deep reaches.</p>

<p class="regtxt20">Note and <a href="../common/story_images/rosetta_texts.png">Rozetta Stone</a> - in dragon chest - In the hidden halls of the Enelman holdings, find the last fireplace. Face the stone, turn to the left, walk three and one half paces, turn left. Find the third knot from the floor, press in and twist one eighth turn to the right, pressin harder and turn one half turn to the left. Go down the ladder behind the panel and open the trap in the floor. Descend the the deepest point and turn to the left. Follow the tunnel until the end, past the <a href="../c_fred2/enelsecretsphnx.htm">sphynx</a> statue (will call to Ivan's character - he will need to stop and examine it thoroughly) in the center of the passage. From the end wall, count back 7 flags, sharply rap the left upper corner four times. Place the key into the mechanism and turn to the left until it clicks. Push the key down until it will go no further, turn gently and allow it to rise back up until you can easily turn it left some more and turn until you hear a second click. Push down hard, turn one quarter turn to the right and step back. A stone trap will open to a steeply descending stair. Follow the purple blaze marks to the chamber of spiders. Be very careful, the halls are littered with traps and dangers. Within the chamber of spiders is where I found my doom. Do not follow this path unless there is dire reason to do so. There may be other things lurking in the ruins, seeking escape.</p>

<p class="regtxt20">Consider updating the Ishra temple to be on top of an older temple to the Keeper. Within the temple to the Keeper was the binding area for the demon that killed Pag's mother. The Keepers temple has a model of the Well, the access to the Great Repository, and into this was fitted the binding cap that Pag's mom opened. In the Well Temple is something containing bits of the scriptures that speak of an entry to the Repository.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Asad</p>

<p class="regtxt15">there have been several black and orange wearing men in the Lotus. so far they have been quiet and well-behaved, but they are giving her a bad feeling and they are watching everyone who comes in.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Lucy should reveal a bit more about the arrival and times of Irena</p>

<p class="regtxt15">overhear talk about missing caravans from the High Valley - this is the beginnings of the <a href="npcs/amorama.htm">Amorma</a> tie-in, <a href="nocs/stephanos.htm">Stephanos</a>, and the <a href="items/ring_onemind.htm">Ring of Onemind</a></p>

<p class="regtxt15">consider - an acquaintance, that has been assimilated, coming back to Miskaton to hunt for rings. this acquaintance could either approach Asad with the "great news" about the Unity, or could be overheard talking to others</p>

<p class="regtxt15"></p>

<p class="regtxt12">Goraze</p>

<p class="regtxt15">need something from the headmistress, maybe about the Carnival? also, ask Goraze to find out about what the Froys might have found four years ago. at the time it had seemed ended, but now there is something hovering on the edges of the energy node that the school sits on, and it is slowly growing in power - should be something Dark Forces related, learning how to use the energy of the World Gate system to feed and grow stronger. this would be a boost to the Dark Forces before they get the Hell Gates open.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Tube Train Codes: Hive, Azkelon, Miskaton, Cavern, Mach Ruins</p>

<p class="regtxt15"></p>

<p class="regtxt15">After finding either the Ishra Temple or the second cache (depends on time) a message will be sent for Goraze from her mother. it will be a request passed on from her grandmother, to come and see her in Machine Ruins. Somewhere in this chain of events the initializer part of the <a href="items/kaltereth_key.htm">key</a> to <a href="npcs/kaltereth.htm">Kaltereth</a>'s <a href="info/k_tower.htm">tower</a> should be passed to Goraze. It could be in a chest her grandmother wants recovered from a plcae outside Machine Ruins, or some other way. If it is from outside, it should be at the Gate beneath the area where the bandits are. These are men who are wanting to hit back at the matriarchy of the Empire. The Hut stands near the Gate and will acquire the party once they are close enough. On assimilation, Pag goes to the Controller's chambers while the rest end up in the throne room. The others are unable to approach the throne, they are blocked by a force wall until Pag returns.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Goraze will be geased to hunt for the other sections of the key and the tower on the Lone Mountain.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Kaltereth was the mother of Goraze's mother and the old woman who desires items recovered from Machine Ruins and the holder of a key passed down from her mother. the key to the tower was sent to her when Kaltereth went off after Tolaz and was wrapped in a forget, do not notice spell. Kaltereth's message will allow Goraze to see the key when picking up the items for her aunt.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">aunt is from Machine Ruins originally, now she lives in a small holding in the R8 section nearest the "F" in Jakara. she is on a military pension and is in fading health</p>

<p class="regtxt15">she has vivid memories of Irena during the war - standing in the center of carnage, calling down destruction on the enemies around her, skin bleached white and stretched over a skeletal frame as blast after blast flashed around her. at the end of the battle she and Shandi limped off the field, Irena bleeding from her ears and staggering, leaning heavily on Shandi who was covered in blood and bits of torn flesh. she has never forgotten the few words she overheard, "chances to use my power are so very rare" - the aunt will ramble on about those times throughout the conversation, remembering the horrors and the intensity of that time far more clearly than the present. somewhere in there she might mention her lost sister, Kalteret<h/p>

<p class="regtxt12">Headmistress</p>

<p class="regtxt15">if asked about World gates explains a bit about the slaved gate under the school. might reveal that it took special begging to get the Insane One to unlock it for that purpose. in reality, it is fully enabled thanks to the Trikster and the Ghost of the Machine (Tyana)</p>

<p class="regtxt15">if asked for details about using World Gates for travel, she will reveal there are side-effects of too much exposure to the Gate Dimension and that frequent travel will render these semi-permanent</p>

<p class="regtxt15">will be waiting at the terminal when they arrive</p>

<p class="regtxt15">will know Goraze has been issued a key</p>

<p class="regtxt15">does she have anything else to tell them?</p>

<p class="regtxt15">could reveal a back way into the TT from a protected access that comes out behind one of the less visible areas of the school, if she thinks it wise to allow them unrestricted access to the terminal</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Kayara</p>

<p class="regtxt15">alerted by Hive Queen about adventurers</p>

<p class="regtxt15"></p>

<p class="regtxt12">Lucy</p>

<p class="regtxt15">a worker from the Jewel should come in to talk to Lucy just as the players are finishing their discussions. it should be reported that one of the noble patrons was found dead in his chamber and the girl servicing him has disappeared. the girl was replaced by a <a href="char_type_info/facedancers.htm">Face Dancer</a> trained <a href="char_type_info/dwseduct.htm">DWSeductress</a> in the employ of <a href="npcs/aztol.htm">Aztol</a> and she has just finished her commision. the man looks like he was drained of life. his blood is powdery, his skin shrunken, leathery, and extremely pale. there are strange cuts on his genitals. It was Kenriss, head of a shipping house that mostly ran from the upper valley to Miskaton. This leaves his 18 year old daughter, who is being courted by someone from Azkelon. (not Tolaz, but a tool of his named Donian Erissen.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">the method of death is not recognized by Lucy or any of the staff. someone versed in healing majik, from the school or from the small Cassi cult nearby, might know what it is. it will take research to find out the specifics. Lucy will send someone to the Cassi cult first - they are nearer and have done services for the Jewel in the past. the fairly young priestess will have to bring in the High Priestess to properly identify C.O.D. - will ask about the character of the victim, this brings out the usual reasons for this form - it's not been seen in quite some time</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Pag might know of a small cult presence in one of the quieter, more run down areas of town. they could explain a bit about the cult and how things have shifted lately, like the goddess no longer hears them the way she used to - this will fit what they know about Ishra being held captive.</p>

<p class="regtxt15"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">murder mystery</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Pag - find out about shipping company, person, etc.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Kenriss Shipping</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Large trading group for resources from the upper valley area, also one of the main groups handling cargos from the Ancients Way and the High Valley. Often sub-contracts Riverwind when they are available. Respected, with heavy ties into other merchanter households - primarily secondary value adders - jewelers, high end armor and weapons manufacture, and luxury items.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Kenriss was a stern but likeable leader of his group. He ran a competent and efficient group with mostly happy employees. The company holds a large cluster of warehouses on the Expr and a small warehouse on the Zithril River for trade in that direction. The comapny also maintains warehouses and offices in West Port and East Port to service land based travel from those ports.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Lucy - determine "containment protocol" for Jewel</p>

<p class="regtxt12">depends on client - if everyone knew he was here, contact the guards and make everything available - let their scryers attempt to pierce the veil. The scryers won't get a lot - too much blocking from other Seers and deliberate obfuscation spells, triggered by a swollowed item. A careful detect majik would reveal this</p>

<p class="regtxt15">In this case, this would be a good time to call the watch - they might be able to give a few clues</p>

<p class="regtxt12">more data on Irena and company</p>

<p class="regtxt15">I'll tell you all I know. I wasn't going to as a way to protect Asad, but, sfter thinking about it, I don't think it really would protect him at all.</p>

<p class="regtxt18">When I was seventeen summers seven strangers arrived in Stratmore. They cam from the mountains, from the upper valley, where there were only outlying farms and the odd brigand. Most of them were injured, some severely, including Irena. We healed them and let them recover with us. Only one spoke our language fluently enough to communicate at first, although the others picked it up very quickly. Irena puzzled the healers, she remained almost mute and childlike, able to follow simple instructions, but not much else. Often we would find her sitting somewhere staring at her hands, flexing them, and staring.</p>

<p class="regtxt18">We came to know there names and they came to learn our ways as the early spring gave way to early summer.</p>

<p class="regtxt20">Irena remained passive through that first summer, although there was an aura of authority that even her lack of focus couldn't hide. Given the right circumstances she could have been a great ruler from the way she carried herself.</p>

<p class="regtxt20">Kara was friendly and helpful, always quick to share a joke or a smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt20">Kyira was very odd. She looked similar to many of the descriptions of succubi, exquisitely beautiful with large bat-like wings and a tail that forked into two agile long finger-like projections. She was quite, stayed to herself and didn't bother anyone. She was the hardest one to welcome and warm up to and she somehow managed to cope without complaint.</p>

<p class="regtxt20">Krystal was the one who knew our language and said she had come from the Lotus Empire originally.</p>

<p class="regtxt20">Lynn was another quiet woman, small, with a short temper, but a great help with anything remotely mechanical</p>

<p class="regtxt20">Shandi was scary. There's no other way to put it. She was inhumanly fast and strong, obviously highly intelligent but almost unable to speak at all. When she did it was jerky and clipped, like finding the words was next to impossible. Her friends used a complicated hand language to communicate with her. She could go from almost asleep to focused, cold, and deadly within seconds, as we saw when a frisky band of raiders tried to move into town</p>

<p class="regtxt20">Will was a sweet man, older, pleasant, unassuming and always easy to be around.</p>

<p class="regtxt20">In mid-winter an accident revived Irena's mind. She quickly assimilated our language, the village ways of doing things, and anything else she put her mind to.</p>

<p class="regtxt20">In the spring she disappeared along with Kyira, Krystal, and Shandi. Several weeks later Kara, Lynn, Will, and I went to find them. We would get hints now and again that took us as far as the Lotus Empire, then all trace vanished. Kara, lynn, and Will returned to the Expr Vallety while I remained in the Lotus Empire and grew to love it.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Gamino - has heard of Ishra temple in the poor setions - set location</p>

<p class="regtxt12">figure out what he discovers while searching for info about either Janis, or the unknown tradesman in the "underworld"</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Your friends wonder where you disappeared to, especially the ones you forgot to tell about the trip to Azkelon and Stratmore.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">One of your closest friends, Adramaki, mentions that Elris disappeared in the North Port are, near where the city ends and the swamps begin. This was after Elris had been trying to learn more about an abandoned warehouse that had shown signs of activity.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Adramaki had seen someone of Janis' description near that warehouse. Others have seen an increased number of people coming and going from that building. Melketh has been watching the building from a safer distance for a while and has seen weapons and probably drug shipments entering and leaving the building.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">There has been an increase in strangers attempting to masquerade as the poor, but their mannerisms just aren't right. They seem to be coming and going from the same warehouse, using it as a common point.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Melketh has been watching the building from a safer distance for a while and has seen weapons and probably drug shipments entering and leaving the building. This corresponds to an increase of cheap weapons in the poor areas, often sold by the new strangers.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Melketh also heard a strange sound coming from the swamps north of the city. It was a weird tearing, ripping sound, sort of like being too close to a lightning strike, but louder and longer in duration. He heard it twice two nights ago.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">There has been a rise in the prevalence of a new drug in town over the past few months. It started slowly, but appears to be very addictive and very dangerous. It seems to be some of the shipments arriving at that warehouse.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Ronerto, who works in the poorer sections of West Port, has noticed lights and activities in an abandoned manor, on a small hill, just outside the main sections of the town.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">A woman's body was pulled from the canals several weeks ago, from an area not known as a body dump. She was youngish and of noble or pampered disposition, with a very fancy and odd tattoo on her back. Adramaki happened to overhear the bone scavengers talking about it. One of their children made a drawing of the tattoo before the body was dealt with. There were no clothes or other items with the body.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Taramis, a Seer of small skill, has been overheard warning of darkness rising in the old dwarven mines on the road to the High Valley.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Gorase - runner to Mistress of School - basics of killing, similar to Ishra "gift", seems unlikely just happened, any info you can provide? urgently need assistance on magical tracking of person of interest</p>

<p class="regtxt12">headmistress suggests bringing in the watch and using their specialized trackers. she thinks Lucy would know a captain of the watch that would be friendly.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">data on Janis, Zayna, known persons, contacts, outside interests</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Janice - well liked, good at her job, had a solid stream of regulars</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Janis - mother died years ago, father still lives in a modest place in Westport, Janis was giving him part of her pay since she lived at the Jewel and he was getting older. father is weaponsmith by trade. they loved each other and got along well</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Matus, father, gruff but basically a nice man, notice Janis didn't seem herself the last few weeks - 3 maybe - little things that added up to not behaving like his daughter. he was aware of the relationship between Zayna and his daughter. His only regret was no grandchildren, although the two had talked about alternate arrangements for having some, but all palns had been for later.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Gamino - any more data from contacts?</p>

<p class="regtxt12"></p>

<p class="regtxt12">Zayna - friend of Janis, lover, and "wife" to their way of thinking. they met when the started working at the Jewel. Zayna started a few months before Janis and showed her the way of things</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Zayna's parents are low rich and don't understand why their daughter would willingly embrace the life of the Jewel. Zayna isn't completely sure of her motives either, some are to piss off her parents, some were to avoid arranged marriage, now that she is "used goods" to the rich, she doesn't have to worry. She has come to enjoy much of the work at the Jewel and was deeply in love with Janis</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Murder Mystery Continued</p>

<p class="regtxt12">the Face Dancer should still be working the city. If the players can find her, there is a way to remove the influence of the Rider Demon keeping her bound. Need to decide how they could find out the "cure" and where the Face Dancer is. Consider Ishra Cult in town could have some of the answers.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">need to place the Ishra Cult and find a way to link them to the players.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">General Data</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Milicine - supervisor from midnight to 0700</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Arianne - from 0700 to 1400</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Nayasha - 1400 to midnight</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Kenriss - a likeable but careful businessman, respected by his employees, clients, and competitors. Most everyone knows he started seeing someone at the Jewel when his wife became sick and after she died. his wife and daughter knew and were glad because he seemed happier after he told them.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Licia Kenriss - daughter - not stupid, just sheltered. has been swept off her feet by Kenrith Mazdross from Azkelon. Mazdross is a tool of Tolaz. Tolaz wants Kenriss shipping because of its contacts with Riverwind and as a front to expand the drug trade from up-river. this would give him a strong foothold in Miskaton, something he doesn't have yet. Licia has learned well from her father, just hasn't been seasoned in the ways of determining trustworthiness in the people she is dealing with. Kenrith has swept her off her feet because of his smooth charm. she has yet to see beneath the mask. Licia would make a competent, becoming excellent, heir to her father's oncerns, if she isn't killed by Kenrith when she refuses to grant him control.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Kenrith Mazdross - appears to be a courtly and cultured young man, is cold and ruthless underneath. he sees Licia as a pawn and a source of easy sex after marriage, but has no interest in her beyond the need for a tropohy-wide and the access to the shipping company</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Miskaton Update - post to campaign wiki</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Since Miskaton is basically a grouping of islands in the center of the convergence of two rivers, there needed to be access to the land routes near it. To solve this, the small satellite towns of West Port, East Port, and North Port were formed. These each sit on one of the river banks and have direct freight and ferry service to major sections of Miskaton.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">North Port was set in the lowlands north of the city, and for several generations, it flourished. Just after the Hell Gate Wars there were severe floods which raised the permanent level of the river enough to leave the North Port areas flooded. It also triggered another round of rebuilding in Miskaton itself. North Port was abandoned in favor of Arisalia just up the Expr River.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">general happenings</p>

<p class="regtxt15">several shipments haven't arrived from the High Valley - overheard in the Jewel common room - Amorama beginning assimilations</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Riverwind - disappeared or stopped making runs - Lucy, observations of the river traffic - not apparent at first - or has modified its route so it no longer goes north of Miskaton. if they stop running, what do they do and where do they go</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Shadow Storm demon beginning to build power - need mechanism and who notices</p>

<p class="regtxt15">far section of the city - near the northern swamp - getting more dangerous - at least one of Gamino's friends has disappeared in that area</p>

<p class="regtxt15">DWSeductress killing in Jewel</p>

<p class="regtxt15"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">What is going on in Frenlayish?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Carnival has just been. A couple of tavern patrons will be comiserating over the loss of wives and daughters. The post-carnival reaction is mixed, some had a great time, others feel like it was a bunch of cheats, thieves, and seductresses, stealing their money, children, and wives.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">On the road in the party will find a faded, old looking play-bill from the Carnival.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">What is going on in Stratmore?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">something effecting Asad's grandmother and her inn</p>

<p class="regtxt9">need some clue(s) to the Stratcom site buried in the mountains outside of the village</p>

<p class="regtxt9">are they going to try and find the wreck from the Ghost Wind? (see what the PCs do)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">bring Centrys into the mix - but only through Pag's dreams at first. Centrys won't be an issue until the Hut is online</p>

<p class="regtxt5">next Pag dream should be linking the Hut to Home 0 and staring up at the Spire, the next Diary Entry should be Irena's meeting with Yara</p>

<p class="regtxt5">save the Centrys city entry for later - maybe a dream of exiting the 12 Factols and an entry about the city?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">on Hut entry - party is redirected to the Controller's bedchamber - Pag landing nearest the bed and the book resting on it</p>

<p class="regtxt5">current factions involved in the balance</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Aztol</p>

<p class="regtxt12">needs new Arcane after defection and death of Kaltereth</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Tamrisa - Stygian, trained at the School of Magic, the "recruited" by Aztol - although, more willingly than many</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Elentaryn</p>

<p class="regtxt12">rebuild the Golden Age</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Stephanos</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Likes his independence, has stopped searching for the Ring other than to protect himself. Will feel that it is becoming active as the Lich begins assimilations.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Razaks</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Disappointed by Stephanos lack of progress, they will send in another team</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Lich Lord with Razak Ring</p>

<p class="regtxt12">use ring to build army to sweep the living from the valley and take Miskatonic U. for himself, then out into the multi-verse</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Proxy Gods</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Proxy Demons</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Kayara and the Dark Carnival</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Sharyl</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Other Campaign Notes</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Need to introduce the Hand and Akhalt as they have impacted the Lotus Empire.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Have someone send one of the party to the Machine Ruins to pick up a small inheritance from a distant aunt, barely remembered by the player character. One of the items could be the chest with the Hut items, or there could be a note or map or something similar telling the players where to find something the aunt had hidden away back in the times of the Hellgate Wars.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The aunt is a sister of Barake and was a squad leader in the Hellgate Wars. She encountered Irena and Shandi. They will have made an impression on her. Now she is old and infirm and needs something in the stuff she hid away. She has sent for her niece/nephew (whichever works for party mix) because she has no children of her own and needs someone to go and get her hidden items. This could be the standard tunnel/cave kind of fight with a low level bunch of bandits. in this case males who didn't want to submit to the matriarchy. the fancy themselves rebels, although they really are just petty thieves, with no redeeming graces. The letter will arrive at Miskaton while the party is away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bandits are holed up in a series of caves near the road to the Pearl Cities and above the Gate Chamber. The Gate is one of the World gates and is sealed with Elentaryn's tecno-stuff. The chest Goraze's aunt wants has not been found by the bandits. It contains the Hut items and something about a place called the Caverns of Dark Delights and the pass-phrase to get from the Holed Frieghter.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">To Do</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shift tube train link between main line and Miskaton so it passes through Azkelon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">write up a conversation between Gorash's aunt and the party - she knew Irena and considers her to be an ancient</p>

<p class="regtxt9">She was a nice girl, for an Ancient. She had some really strange friends with her. None of them seemed to understand where they were, but they all seemed nice enough. She could summon destruction as only the grand Tesch of the old stories could do. The two of them saved us in the end. We were getting our asses handed to us by the dark forces until Irena and her friend entered the battle. Her friend was a death dealer, a warrior extra-ordinaire, unstoppable and unkillable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider the first Hut adventure to be on the Alt. Earth of Valen and co., but later in the time-stream, more in the cyber-world future. Remember tech advances of ITC, could maintain the Borusa connection, and the drift into mega-corps instead of nation-states</p>

<p class="sectioncaption"> From Google Docs Campaign notes</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Enelman family</p>

<p class="regtxt9">known for fancy hardwoods and exotic forest plants. they have land holdings west of Miskaton and West Port. Decide if there is something on the land of interest or if the land itself is the item of interest prompting the murders.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">determine actual casualty count. Who were they allied with? Who were there enemies? Daughter on Isle of the Elephant. Figure out sketch of alliances and enemies for the family. What can they get from the watch?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">casualty count - entire family</p>

<p class="regtxt9">half the staff - major-domo was in on it. Assassination was planned by an ally of Tolaz. This frees up another section of Miskaton for invasion/control by nobility from Azkelon. The Enelman family were supporters of the current Merchanter/Nobility as equals in the eyes of the law and in the politics of the city. The face-dancer was used aboard the Netershi to poison the shipment.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">daughter - Katarina Enelman - look at ESDs Al-Qadim for info and ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kenriss family</p>

<p class="regtxt9">father murdered to allow Masdross to marry daughter. this will cement a foothold by Tolaz and cronies into Miskaton shipping.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">mother died a few years ago. father had been seeing a steady at the Jewel. she was killed and replaced with a face-dancer</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Heriskath</p>

<p class="regtxt9">What will she try and do in the morning after not returning home that night? Determine Sellos reaction and actions.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Hari wants the family business to thrive. She loves wine, loves being a wine merchant and advisor to those who love it as much as she does. She wouldn't mind expanding the business to other exotic items, including trade relations with the Empire, were there a way to arrange it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sellos</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Sellos will be angry - Heri should be the model of propriety according to him</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Sellos friend has given him something to make her more docile, to help with bartering her off. unfortunately, it has left her tired, disoriented, and uninterested in much of anything. She will show significant improvement in attitude by morning.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Sellos hates working. He would rather be waited on and served without it requiring effort on his part.</p>

15) notes from Pag's sister to her

16) Lotus Empire to stash Heriskath and for Goraze to talk to his mom.
