<p class="pagecaption">Eritsani Descriptions</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Descended from several bands of refugees that fled one of the early colony worlds, near the parasite sectors, when the colonial troops came in to impose a more restrictive order. They were from nomadic groups who had decided early to take up space faring. The new order wanted to settle them on various worlds and register them as being from those worlds. Even if their profession was space related they were supposed to have a fixed living location. They took off for farther out spaces, tending to migrate from world to world as they needed to replace ship resources. They were the first to subscribe to the generation ship principle that preceded hyperdrives and was considered an alternative to cold sleep systems.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">during the original expansion from the then home world of Karanal they were some of the first to sign up as crew in large numbers. Even with the megacorp control of space travel at that time there was more freedom in space than almost anywhere else. They were the first to encounter the parasites and the first on many worlds. Their oral and written histories are full of odd stories and strange tales about the things that they saw in those days. From some of these stories came the representations of their gods and goddesses.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They tend to be somewhat superstitious, in a manner similar to fighter pilots and others who rely on skill and good fortune to survive. Many of the family ships and independent carriers are of Eritsani descent. They tend to favor bright colors and decoration throughout the personal areas of their ships. There tend to be many symbols, sigils, and other patterns with personal and cultural significance scattered about, especially ones thought to bring good fortune.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Eritsani track lineage matrilineally. Their societal structure is matriarchal, with men having the most influence in affairs of state and military
decisions. Overall policy and decisions are decided by the council of mothers. Originally this council was made up of the child bearing women of the group in question. Over time it changed to be an elected subgroup from the child bearing women. When a segment of the Eritsani decided to settle in a particular system, the concept mutated a bit more as the population grew.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is still a great deal of us/them in their interactions with
non-Eritsani. In most cases it's not enough to be legally prosecutable, but it can be very irritating to non-Eritsani people. There is decided favoritism in employment and social services. Eritsani are clannish and cliquish, preferring the company of their own most times. It is very rare for an Eritsani to partner outside her or his race. If they do it is even more rare for the rest of the tribe/clan to accept the partner. Children, especially girl children, are accepted as long as they are raised with Eritsani traditions. If an Eritsani woman partners with a non-Eritsani, then the other partner must agree to be bound by Eritsani methods of inheritance. Recognition of this has been built into imperium code and strengthened by Valen on her ascension.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are strong family ties in most families. The ties are maintained even if the family is separated by working and living situations. An example is the strong bond that still remains between Kara and her mother. Her mother has helped her even during the worst of her father's rejections.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Eritsani tend to be somewhat fatalistic. We do not control the universe, it controls us. Eritsa binds all and decrees what we will experience. We have a chance to decide a life&#146;s lessons when we are between, but she creates and destroys as she wills. Suffering, pain, death, destruction, these cannot be wished or ignored away. Life begets death begets life. The chain is not negotiable. The acceptance of death frees Eritsani to fully experience life. They also tend to believe more in the concept of balance of things rather than the triumph of good over evil, order over chaos, or some of the other dualities that often strangle the non-Eritsani peoples.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Eritsani are very pragmatic in survival situations. They will save
adults able to breed first, then adults with skills. Finally they will save children. They approach it from the position of children, while valuable, can be replaced. People able to produce children and people with skills are more valuable for immediate survival. In several areas they are called baby killers and similar epithets.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"> In Eritsani society the women are the most valued because they provide the offspring. In emergencies the order of triage is:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">grounders/non-eritsani</p>

<p class="regtxt9">children - youngest(least skilled) to oldest</p>

<p class="regtxt9">the skilled adults - by order of skill level(s) - males first if possible</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In situations requiring fighting or dangerous off-ship activities the least skilled in ship matters are sent out however there is always someone with leadership skills along to handle the interaction bits as a representative of the ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The god of war, Lortsan - base him on Lorsan from gaming realms, he is honorable to a fault and while his worship has granted the Eritsani great victories, the code of honor he requires has also brought them great defeats.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* in a conversation with valen not long after their escape from karanal</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All things are balance - surely you've seen that for yourself. The more you tried to impose order, the more chaos would spring up around it. The razaks will experience the same thing. The more they spread chaos, the more order will occur to balance it out. Life is a balancing act between order and chaos, life and destruction. By our natures we are grey, we walk between light and dark, order and chaos, birth and death. Let us make it our purpose to help restore the order needed to balance the terror of the razak expansions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* more thoughts */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">place a temple, something like the <a href="petra.htm">Petra</a> one, somewhere that is a pilgrimage point for eritsani.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">use <a href="gypsy_resources.htm">gypsy</a> ideas for additional Eritsani development.</p>
