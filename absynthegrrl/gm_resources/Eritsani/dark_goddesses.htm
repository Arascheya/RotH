<p class="pagecaption">Dark Goddesses</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Reach out your hand, Kon. Feel the thing you killed. That's her, that's the goddess...merely flesh, and under the flesh and fleas and fur is the pus of her we forgot. -- Marvin Kaye and Parke Godwin, The Masters of Solitude</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Are you sick of New Age-ers who portray the Goddess as a cosmic Barbie doll, all sweetness and light?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I am.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Okay, sometimes the Goddess does look that way. But She's also embodied in the hurricane, the earthquake, the Ebola virus, and the maggot, just as much as She is in the newborn fawn, the virgin forest, the lover or loving mother.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For male-dominated religions like Christianity, Her dark side is also embodied in women's power to say "No," a power women need to reclaim.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The possibility of a future true morality is contained not in the fear of God, but in the still unknown meanings of the old, grim Goddess who represented fear itself. She is the one we most need to understand: not the pretty Virgin; not the fecund Mother; but the wise, willful, wolfish Crone." -- Barbara Walker, The Crone:Woman of Age, Wisdom and Power</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thus, these goddesses and images. Some, such as the Gorgon, symbolize only fantastic fears experienced by patriarchal men. Others, such as the goddesses of death, are metaphors for things all too real. Both kinds can teach us, though the lessons are different.</p>
