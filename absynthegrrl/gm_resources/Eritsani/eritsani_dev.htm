<p class="regtxt5">/* Eritsani can cast someone out for crimes against the clans. this is usually saved for truly hideous crimes and is determined by the Karakinska clan as part of the ky'ris */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Eritsani background should be more cloaked in mystery and shadows when told to Valen and others. Eritsani are not as insular as they once were as the Grounders accept them  - this is a legacy of Valen who reversed many of the settlement and registration laws the Alliance had tried to enforce. this is also a by-product of the decline of family ships that came about after the development of affordable hyperdrives. */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* should come up with "specialties" for the 7 clans */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Kara should not mention the 8th clan to Valen until she really trusts her */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* the Eritsani will meet in space at various times to renew clan ties and share recent events. these meetings always occur away from planets and shipping, at places known only to them */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* move the eritsani oral histories data to an actual history file and make the Oral Histories more of an oral history feel/form */</p>
