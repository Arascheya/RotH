<p class="regtxt5">RICHARD AND SAUL'S EXCELLENT
ADVENTURE IN PETRA - June 1995</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My friend Saul and I had been discussing a trip to the ancient city of Petra ever since we arrived in Eilat on our 3 month work term. We had heard stories from friends about the beauty and grandeur of the place and were determined to visit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As our work term came to an end we realized how we had been putting off the trip. We knew that if we didn't do it the last weekend we were in Eilat, we would never go. So Thursday afternoon, after packing and cleaning the apartment the whole morning we set off with our bags and cameras ready for an adventure. We had
bought some food and water earlier that day for the days we would be in the park exploring Petra. Saul had to go to the bank before catching the bus to get money for the trip. We knew how much the border taxes were, but didn't know how much we would
spend for a hotel and meals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When we got to the instant teller machine we discovered that here was a power failure. It wasn't just at the bank, or only in Eilat, but across the entire country. This was not a good sign at the start of a trip. We waited awhile at the bank machine hoping the power would return. We must have told 30 people that
there the machines didn't work because there was no power. Not wanting to wait any longer we went to the bus station to see if the bus was still running to the border. After confirming this Saul went home to get some American money he had kept for his trip to Europe.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were set on going that day and nothing was going stop us from
crossing the border before it closed. Just as Saul returned the power was restored to our area (the rest of Israel took a bit longer). This was a sure sign that our trip must continue.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We got to the border and 30 minutes later we were standing in Jordan. We had heard horror stories from people of spending several hour waiting to get into Jordan. But there were only a few people crossing in our direction. Several
tour groups passed through the other way, and I am sure they took a bit longer. On the Israeli side we got our passports stamped and Saul changed some Shekels (Israeli money) into Dinars. I had heard that it would be cheaper to change Dollars into dinars on the other side. This proved true. It costs 47 shekels ($23Can at the time) to leave Israel and 31 Dinar ($65Can) for Canadians to enter Jordan. This is the highest entrance fee of any country. why do we pay more? Most likely because we are so nice don't complain about it. On the Jordanian side we got our entrance visas and I exchanged money.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Surprisingly they didn't check our bags. They had an x-ray machine, but no one indicated for us to go over to it. We walked pass the check post and were on our way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bus system in Jordan is not very good. It is better to take taxis between the major cities. We waited at the border for about 20 minutes until the first taxi arrived. We had met three other travelers going together to Petra and
decided it would be cheapest to share a taxi. The taxi driver didn't speak a word of English. Not surprising in a Country that for years wasn't friendly with the West. Unfortunately the taxi driver would only take up to a maximum of 4 people. The cost
was a standard fare of 25 Dinar ($55Can) and Saul and I were not going to pay it so we let the others have the taxi. This turned out to be the best thing we could have done. We learned later that that taxi had broken down in the middle of the desert on the way to Petra. The people had to wait for another taxi to arrive and take them the rest of the way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We waited another 20 minutes in the hot sun (40C in the shade) and decided to take the next taxi that came by since it was getting last. The driver was nice and only charged us 20 Dinar since there were only two of us. It was also his last fare and he was son his way home. He spoke English well. He had a few years of English in grade school about 20 years ago. With the tourism boom in Jordan he has had a lot of practice with his English. He bought us Cokes along the way and even stopped to give an old Bedouin man some water. Jordan looks very much like Israel. The south is full of mountains and is very hot. The further north we went into the hills the cooler it got.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">From the people we met at the border we learned you could sleep on the roof on a hotel called the "Sunset" for 3 Dinar. It sounded perfect to us, but when we got there they said you couldn't sleep on the roof and the only room they
had was 30 Dinar for a double with a bath. This was out of our price range. We had expected to spend no more than 20 Dinar for the three nights. We left and met another guy (American) just arriving who had had the same idea of sleeping on the roof. After
setting him straight on it we waited for some friends of his and when they arrived we all started walking up in to Wadi Musa (the Jordanian city above Petra). We were joined by another group of three just arriving for the night and the eight of us went in search of a place to sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A man approached us and asked us if we had anywhere to stay. After hearing of our problem he immediately offered us the roof of his house for 2 Dinar a night. This was fine with us because at that point we were exhausted and just wanted somewhere to crash. We  drove out of the city and through the country side until we came to the house. It was in a 'suburb' of Wadi Musa. We overlooked a valley through which one of streams that would run through the park. It turned out that he runs a bed and breakfast with his four brothers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The house was very nice with several rooms upstairs and a large room on the main floor. Once we got there he told us we could sleep inside. We were ready to sleep on the roof and bargained with him. In the end we got to sleep in the house on mattress for the same price as the roof. He also provided dinner (3-4 Dinar), breakfast (1.5 Dinar) and a ride to and from the Park. This was like a dream come
true for Saul and I. It worked fine until the last day when they started to add extra charges onto our bill. Luckily it didn't spoil our stay too much.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You meet interesting people on trips. It isn't like going somehwere with your friends and not socializing with others. In a foreign country you are almost forced to socialize with others who speak your language. At the hotel we stayed at we
were with some Americans about our age and a South African in his fourties, and a couple of Germans similar in age to us. Some of use we travelling just for a few days and had big bags. Some of the other had been travelling for a few months and had smaller bags than us. In the park we met some interesting people. There was a couple from the Netherlands who were in their seventies. They had just been through Syria
and the rest of Jordan. They planned on seeing all of Petra in one day. We saw them all over the park and as the day went on their pace didn't slow a bit. I hope to be that active in my later years.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next day we were up bright and early and at the park by 8am. We each bought a guide book and with three of our new friends from the night before we set off into the park. When we were at Petra there were three types of tickets. The one day pass cost 20 dinar and the two day pass 25 dinar. There was also a 3 day pass for 30 dinar, but I didn't see anyone buy it. You are required to sign your name on the pass and not give it to another person, but if you are on a budget and 20 dinar is too much for one day's touring, you can always find a new arrival willing to split the cost of a two day pass with you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Immediately upon entering you get confronted by bedouins offering you a ride to the ancient city. you can ride on a donkey, or a horse or in a cart. You have to negotiate before the ride how much and where the ride will take you. You don't really need a horse going in but may want a ride out of the park at the end of the
day. On your walk into the part you immediately see several tombs along the way into the city. these two are known as the Obelisk Tomb and, below it, the Bab El --Siq Triclinium (Door of the Gorge Triclinium). These appear impressive, but pale in comparison to the real treasures awaiting you. You come to a dam that was built in 1963 after 28 tourists were killed by a flash flood, and start walking down the Sib (a
dry river bed). As you enter the siq you see two arches on the cliff walls. They are the remains of an aquaduct that brought water to the ancient city. Along both sides of the siq are tall mountain slopes that reach 200 to 300 feet in the air. Along the walls of the siq at eye level you can recognize water channels. They were chiseled out of the rock and allowed water to flow down the siq to the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You walk for about 20 minutes until you reach the first and most impressive building in all of Petra, El Kazneh. This building rises 120 feet in front of you. A two level building that makes you feel like an ant walking into someone's home. It was thought to be sculpted in the first century B.C. there are several
carvings of human forms on its face. there are six giant pillars carved out of the first level that actually support nothing. the second level is symetrical, but smaller.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Its origin can be identified by its name The treasury of the Pharaoh Picture. As well as a treasury (select here to view the treasury) it is thought to  have been a temple to Isis because of of the typical Isis symbol carved on its the face. The beauty is only surface deep because inside is an undecorated large room with two smaller rooms adjoined to it. All the tombs in Petra are like this. On the outside, built on a grand scale, but inside very plain. El Kazneh was used in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It is the best preserved building because it was protected from the elements by the high mountains that surround it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Further into the city you see other tombs, not so grand but still impressive. There are tombs with names like the Urn Tomb, the Silk Tomb and the Palace Tomb. There are many other things to see in the park as well. You can walk up 900 steps and reach one of the high places of sacrifice used by the Nabatians. As you
walk around the ceremonial area you can make out the different areas. The place where the animals were prepared and the altar of sacrifice. You can also see the channels where the blood of the sacrifices would run down into collecting jars. The high place of sacrifice overlooks the entire ancient city and reveals to you many of the tombs carved into the sides of the mountains. Also on this height are two obelixes, each 20 feet tall. To carve the obelixes, the Nabatians cut away the entire mountain top around them until they were at their desired height. There are many tombs along the way down from the high place as well as water channels. The Nabatians were expert at collecting the water that fell in the hills around the city. While there was little rain during the hot summer months, there was plenty of water for public fountains
and crops to support the large city's population.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Another walk is up to the Monastery (Ed Deir), a building on the scale of the treasury. It is carved 150 feet wide and 130 feet tall.(select here to view the monastery). The facade has two geometrically balanced levels. Inside on the far end is a large niche carved for the revered god of the place. There are small
crosses etched in the wall by Christians to purify it from its pagan origins.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">&lt;Picture&gt;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">You can climb up to the top of this
building and see how </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">high up you are, about 1000 feet above the
valley floor (you can even</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">look through the mountains and see Israel).
At the top of the building </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">is a large urn carved out of the rock.
Standing next to it you feel </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">like a child looking up at a high table. It
is called the</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">monastery because it was consecrated by
Christian monks during the</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">12th century C.E.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">There is also the ruins of a Roman city,
built after The </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">Nabatians were defeated by Rome. There is
an amphitheatre that was carved </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">out of the rock. It has a capacity of 3000
spectators and rivals in size </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">any other I have seen in Israel or Italy.
What makes it impressive is </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">the fact that it was cut out of the rock.
In the entire park there is </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">only one masonry building. The Qaser el
bint was used as a Temple when </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">it was contructed in the first century BCE.
It is a truly impressive </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">building. not only because it is standing
after all these years, but the </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">decorations and stone arch that spands the
large entrance way. In front </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">are the remains the large altar platform.
Standing on the platform you </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">get just a sense of what it must have been
like when the temple was in </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">use. This is what Saul and I saw the first
day we were there. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">If you go on an organized tour you will
only spend about 5</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">hours in the park. You will see the
Treasury, maybe the high place, the </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">treasury, and if you hurry the monastery.
We spent 10 hours in the park </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">that first day. On the second day Saul and
I went on our own. We saw </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">several other tombs and then decided to be
adventurous. We found </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">some steps carved into the side of a cliff
away from the main </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">tourist area. We made our way up to the
top. At some times we had </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">carved stairs to follow. At other times we
had to pull ourselves up </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">by way of small foot and hand hold (at 400
feet above the valley </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">floor). We found ourselves at the top
overlooking the entire ruins of </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">Petra. We could see people across the
valley on the other high place </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">(lower than where we were, of course) and
all of the tombs we had visited </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">the day before. Walking around the plateau,
we found several more high </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">places of sacrifice. We were completely
alone up there, not another </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">tourists or bedouins. It was enchanting. We
sat up there looking out at </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">the scenery. Saul even wrote a postcard to
his parents. I left my bag </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">for about 10 minutes in complete confidence
that it would be there when I </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">got back.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">Continuing on our adventurous way, we went
further along the </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">plateau and saw several more ruins. One was
a small hut, probably </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">built by Bedouins. Another was a large
water reservior build by the </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">Namibians to collect rain water. Continuing
on we found ourselves on </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">the top of the cliff directly opposite from
the treasury. We had been </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">impressed to see the building from the
ground. But from above, it was </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">magnificent. We could see so much more
detail. We took several pictures </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">and from below heard people calling up to
us. Some of the Bedouins selling </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">souvenirs were motioning for us to move a
way from the edge. We </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">speculated that they were afraid we would
knock some rocks down and hit </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">some of the tourists. We walked around a
bit more and then had lunch </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">half way up the mountain. We were
completely alone except for two </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">Bedouin girls singing on another mountain
top.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">When we got back down to the valley floor
we continued to walk around </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">some of the tombs (select here to view a
tomb) further out from the main </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">city ruins. The Bedouins use these as
stables for their donkeys. They </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">look nice from the outside but stink
inside. We next walked into a Wadi </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">that took us right into the ancient city.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">&lt;Picture&gt;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">We next hiked up to a crusader fortress
that overlooks the</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">ancient city from the west side. Compared
to the rest of the park</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">it was disappointing. We climbed up and up
and up. At the top</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">you can see the outline of the fortress,
but no walls remain</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">standing. On the way down we passed several
interesting rooms. one had </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">many niches carved into the walls. The
other was an infinished tomb. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">The Nabatians built their tommbs by cutting
out the rock at the top of a </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">tomb and removing the rock until they
reached the floor level. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">By this time we had been in the part for 7
hours that day. We were </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">tired and ready to go home. But, the day
before we had heard that there </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">was a small pool of water in one of the
wadis. Saul and I knew that this </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">would be the be topper to our trip.
Relaxing in a cool pool of fresh </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">water after hiking in the desert all day.
We had to walk about 20 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">minutes along the wadi to get to it. We had
no clue how far it was, but </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">we caught sight of the stream and followed
it to a small pool. It may </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">not have been &quot;The Pool&quot; but it
was good enough for us. The water was </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">cool and felt so good. While we were there
a Bedouin came by and sat on </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">a rock near the pool. He didn't get in the
water, but sat and watched </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">us. After 10 minutes we got out and started
on our way. We Immediately </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">took the wrong turn, but the Bedouin
stopped us and lead us back to the </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">ruins. We felt like he was our own personal
guide. So in the end we </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">were in the park for 9 hours that day.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">Walking through the park at the end of the
day is nice. The sun </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">is setting and the air cooler. The shadows
are cast long against the </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">sides of the tombs and Siq walls. We took
our own water and food for the </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">day so our backpacks were much lighter. We
consumed about 5 litres of </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">water each day. Be prepared to drink alot
while you are there. you </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">don't notice losing the wate so you have to
force yourself to drink every </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">half hour or so. The food inside the park
is very expensive. You can </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">buy food in Wadi Musa and bring it with
you. We took canned good and </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">pita. It worked well because we had a big
meal before ,and after we were </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">in the park. Take a lot of film with you.
If you need to buy film, but </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">it before going into the park, it will be
less expensive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">The next day we were up and at the bus stop
(actually a street</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">corner in Wadi Musa) by 6am to catch the
bus to Aqaba. We wanted to be </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">at the border when it opened at 9am. We met
the nice taxi driver who had </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">taken us in on Friday. He was going to Mann
to visit family. He made </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">sure we got on the right bus. The bus did a
small tour around the town, </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">stopping at some of the hotels. It wa was
full by the time it stopped at </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">the last hotel. The trip cost 2 Dinar from
Wadi Musa to Aqaba and 10 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">dinar for the taxi to the border. When we
got to the border it was </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">clear. It took us twenty minutes and we
were back at the bus to the </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">Eilat bus station.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">The trip is well worth it. If you get a
package tour to several </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">sites in Jordan try and spend as much time
in the parks as possible. I </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">have been told that the tour guides that go
with the package tour are </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">very good and are a great source of
information about everything, not </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">just the sites.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">Some of the pictures included in my
adventure are mine and others </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">I got from Active Life Publications (Travel
tales and photographs of Nepal,</font></p>
