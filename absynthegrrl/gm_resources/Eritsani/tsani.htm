<p class="pagecaption">T'Sani</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These are the Wandering Peoples that are descendants of the <a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">Eritsani</a> wanderers. They tend to be planet bound, except for the group attached to the <a href="../info/carnival.htm">Dark Carnival</a>. Most of the <a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">Eritsani</a> data applies to these peoples. T'Sani tend to be even more clanish than their space based ancestors, having been subjected to intense persecution and distrust from the landed or Statics, as they are called.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For game use, T'Sani are closer to gysies in actions and appearance. Inter-breeding with the Static is rare, but does happen. It is more often a T'Sani male taking a Static female lover. Any child of the affair remains the responsability of the Static. T'Sani believe Static blood is inferior and do not wish their lines tainted.</p>
