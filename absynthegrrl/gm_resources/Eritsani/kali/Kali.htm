      <P><FONT color=#990000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>The 
      Great Goddess Kali can never be understood by the intellect. To know Her 
      we must plunge into Her luscious, radiant, blackness, dive through our 
      fear into Her terrifying mystery and allow ourselves to dissolve in Her 
      velvety midnight embrace. By Her grace we may know the unutterable truth 
      of Her love, even as we are annihilated by Her infinitude. Beware, you may 
      return babbling, forever lost to your spouse! </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#990000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Kali is 
      the Source, the One that gives birth to All. Known as a slayer of demons 
      She destroys the army of mind-born delusions that separate us from the 
      Divine. To our bound, limited and contracted identities She strikes 
      terror, appearing as a coal-black, sword-wielding, blood-smeared dancer of 
      death and destruction. To our true Self, She is our supremely beautiful 
      Beloved, performing a ballet of incomparable grace. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#990000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Only a 
      poet saint can assemble the words necessary to point our attention toward 
      Her. Ramprasad Sen, the eighteenth-century Bengali poet-saint, is one of 
      the most loquacious of Her devotees. Lex Hixon brilliantly rendered 
      Ramprasad&#8217;s poems into English verse in his book, <B>Mother of the 
      Universe</B>. Letting your mind step aside for a moment, allow your heart 
      and soul to feast on these two poems: </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT color=#990000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>The 
      mantra Om Kali Ma vibrates with Her power and serves as a Divine vehicle 
      for transporting you into Her domain. Using it for meditation, you breathe 
      in Om Kali Ma with every inhalation, silently repeating it in your mind, 
      savoring the subtle sounds of each syllable as She infuses every cell of 
      your body with Her power, radiance and love. With every exhalation, 
      silently breathe out<I> </I>Om Kali Ma, feeling Her presence filling the 
      universe around you. Breathe in Om Kali Ma<I> </I>drinking in Her elixir. 
      Breathe out Om Kali Ma as you float like a bubble in the ocean of the 
      Divine. Your body may be gently swayed by Her lullaby as the ego-mind 
      falls asleep and the Divine awakens within you. Meditate daily, taking 
      delight in all She shows you. Om Kali Ma, Jai Kali Ma! </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#990000 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>When the 
      intellect grows jealous of the heart and soul enjoying the nectar of 
      meditation on Her, you can feed your mind the works of Lex Hixon and 
      Ramakrishna Paramahamsa - the great 19th century Kali devotee of 
      Dakshineshwar, India. Elizabeth Harding&#8217;s book, <B>Kali: The Black Goddess 
      of Dakshineswar</B>, is also well worth reading. Chanting the names of the 
      Goddess or listening to such chants is a sublime practice in itself. The 
      recordings of <B><A href="http://www.krishnadas.com/" 
      target=_blank>Krishna Das</A></B> - <B>One Track Heart, Pilgrim Heart 
      </B>and <B>Live on Earth</B> - may move you into Her ecstasy. The visions 
      Kali granted me are shared in <B><A
