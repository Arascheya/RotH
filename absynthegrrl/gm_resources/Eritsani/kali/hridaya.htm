<p align="center"><i>&quot;Final liberation is attained by the knowledge that the atma is
the witness, is the truth, is omnipresent, is one, free from all deluding distractions of
self and not-self, the supreme, and though abiding in the body is not in the body.&quot; -
<b>Mahanirvana Tantra XIV, 116.</b></i><br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Shri Mahakala said: Listen, dearest, to Dakshina's supreme secret, very hidden and
difficult to obtain, her very marvellous hymn known as the Hridaya. Unvocalised before, I
reveal it now because of your love. It should be concealed from others! This is true,
true, O Mountain Born One. </p>

<p>Shri Devi said: Shambhu Maheshvara, ocean of compassion, in which yuga did my hymn
arise, and how was it created? </p>

<p>Shri Mahakala said: A long time ago I decapitated Prajapati, and due to this evil act
of slaying a brahmana came to be Bhairava (1). I created this hymn to destroy the sin of
brahminicide, dearest. This hymn destroys the consequence of killing brahmins (2). </p>

<p><b>Application:</b> Om. Shri Mahakala is the rishi of this heart mantra of Shri
Dakshina Kalika. Ushnik is the metre. Shri Dakshina Kalika is the devata. <a href="22(1).wav">Krim</a> is the bija. Hrim is the shakti. Namah is the peg. Its
application follows from its continual recitation. </p>

<h2>Heart nyasa etc.</h2>

<p>Om. Kram to the heart namah. <br>
Om. Krim to the head svaha. <br>
Om. Krum to the peak vasat. <br>
Om. Kraim to the armour hum. <br>
Om. Kraum to the three eyes vausat. <br>
Om. Krah to the missile Phat. </p>

<p>Meditate on Kali Mahamaya with three eyes, of different forms, with four arms, a
rolling tongue, bright as a full moon, the colour of a blue night lotus, dispeller of the
assembly of enemies, holding a man's skull, a sword, a lotus, and giving boons. </p>

<p>Her mouth is bloody and fanged, she has a fear inspiring form, she is addicted to very
loud laughter and completely naked. </p>

<p>The Devi sits on a corpse and is adorned with a garland of skulls. After meditating on
Mahadevi like this, then read the Hridaya. </p>

<p>Om Kalika, primordial and terrifying form, bestower of the fruit of all desires, hymned
by all gods, destroy my enemies. </p>

<p>Hrim, you who are the essence of Hrim, the most excellent thing in the three worlds,
hard to obtain, out of love for me, deny anything whatsoever to he whom I name! </p>

<p>Now I speak of the meditation, O supreme self, the essence of night. Whoever knows this
becomes liberated while still living. </p>

<p>Meditate on her having dishevelled and matted hair, decorated with strings of serpents,
a half moon as her diadem, in union with Mahakala. </p>

<p>Boon giver, visualising her like this causes all people to become liberated in every
way. This is true, true. </p>

<p>Now listen to the yantra of the supreme goddess, the giver of success in whatsoever is
desired. Hide this greatly quintessential secret of secrets with every effort. </p>

<p>The Kali yantra, the giver of true siddhi, is made from five triangles, an eight petal
lotus, surrounded by a bhupura, and encompassed by skulls and funeral pyres (3). The
mantra, previously spoken of, should always be worn on the body dearest! </p>

<p>Now Devi Dakshina Kali's garland of names is revealed: Kali, Dakshina Kali, black of
body, the supreme self, wearing a garland of skulls, large eyed, cause of creation and
dissolution, self of maintenance, Mahamaya, the power of yoga, the essence of good
fortune, the female serpent, intoxicated with wine, the sacrificial offering, with the
vagina as her banner, primordial one, always ninefold, terrifying, the greatly effulgent
one, formidable, with a corpse as her vehicle, Siddhi Lakshmi, Niruddha, Sarasvati. </p>

<p>Whoever recites this garland of names daily causes me to become their slave.
Maheshvari, this is true, true. </p>

<p>Kali, destroyer of time, goddess of skeletal form, taking the form of a raven, blacker
than black, I worship you O Dakshina Kalika! </p>

<p>I bow to you Kalika, Maharaudri, fond of the night, Devi liking kunda, gola and
svayambhu flowers (4). </p>

<p>I bow to you Duti (5), the Duti causing yoga to arise from sexual intercourse, you who
are the great Duti, fond of Dutis, the supreme Duti, the Lady of Yoga. </p>

<p>Those who recite the mantra Krim seven times over water and then sprinkle themselves
with it destroy all disease. There is no question about this. </p>

<p>Those who seek any object who charge sandal paste with the great mantra Krim Svaha and
then make a forehead mark of it become the most intelligent of people, and always able to
subjugate. </p>

<p>Dearest, those who offer unhusked rice while reciting the mantra Krim Hram Hrim seven
times, destroy great worries and obstacles, there is no doubt of it. </p>

<p>Those who pronounce the mantra Krim Hrim Hrum Svaha over the cremation pyre, then
encircle the house of their enemies with the ashes kill their enemies. </p>

<p>Those who offer seven flowers and pronounce the mantra Hrum Hrim Krim uproot their
foes, no doubt of it. </p>

<p>If, after reciting Krim Krim Krim, while offering unhusked rice, it causes the object
of attraction to swiftly come from a distance of even 1,000 yojanas (6). </p>

<p>Those who recite the mantra Krim Krim Krim Hrum Hrum Hrim Hrim seven times, purifying
water and making a forehead mark of it, delude the whole world. </p>

<p>Parameshani, this Hridaya is the destroyer of all evil, a million million times greater
than Ashvamedha and other sacrifices. The fruit it gives is one million million times
better than the offerings given to virgins (7). Its results, it is said, are greater by
one million million than those obtained from offering to Dutis. </p>

<p>It is a million times greater than the results obtained from bathing in the Ganges and
other sacred waters. Reciting it only once bestows these results. This is true, true, I
swear it. </p>

<p>The initiated person who, after worshipping a kumari of beautiful form, and then
recites this hymn, becomes liberated whilst living, O Maheshani. </p>

<h2 align="center">Notes</h2>

<p>(1) This story is related in the Skanda Purana. BrahmË liked his daughter and wanted
to couple with her. But that didn't meet with the approval of Shiva, who cut off his fifth
head. Brahma and Shiva had a great fight, which the latter won. Shiva, however, had
committed the sin of killing a Brahmin, an act requiring expiation. Forever afterwards,
Shiva in his form of Bhairava, the terrible one, bears the fifth head of Brahma. </p>

<p>(2) So followers of Shiva have a licence to kill brahmins! This probably stems from a
time when the Aryan race was entering India and faced opposition from the indigenous
tribes already occupying the subcontinent. </p>

<p>(3) Kali has eight different cremation grounds. They are enumerated in the huge work
called the Mahakalasamhita, Guhyakali Khanda. </p>

<p>(4) The three primary types of menstrual blood in the tantrik tradition. </p>

<p>(5) Duti means messenger. Yet the meaning is She who makes Shiva Her messenger. </p>

<p>(6) A Hindu measure of distance. </p>

<p>(7) Kumari Puja - to this day performed in Nepal, where a young girl is treated as an
incarnation of the goddess. </p>
