      the year 1847, the wealthy widow Rani Rasmani prepared to go upon a long
      pilgrimage to the sacred city of Banaras to express her devotions to the
      Divine Mother. In those days there was no railway line between Calcutta
      and Banaras and it was more comfortable for rich persons to make the
      journey by boat rather than by road. We are told that the convoy of Rani
      Rasmani consisted of twenty four boats carrying relatives, servants, and
      supplies. But the night before the pilgrimage began, the Divine Mother, in
      the form of the goddess Kali, intervened. She appeared to the Rani in a
      dream and said, "There is not need to go to Banaras. Install my statue in
      a beautiful temple on the banks of the Ganges river and arrange for my
      worship there. Then I shall manifest myself in the image and accept
      worship at that place." Profoundly affected by the dream, the Rani
      immediately looked for and purchased land, and promptly began construction
      of the temple. The large temple complex, built between 1847 and 1855, had
      as its centerpiece a shrine of the goddess Kali, but also had temples
      dedicated to the deities Shiva and Radha-Krishna. A scholarly and elderly
      sage was chosen as the head priest and the temple was consecrated in 1855.
      Within the year this priest died and his responsibility passed to his
      younger brother, Ramakrishna, who over the next thirty years would bring
      great fame to the Dakshineswar temple.<BR><BR>Ramakrishna did not serve
      for long as temple's head priest however. From the first days of his
      service in the shrine of the goddess Kali, he was filled with a rare form
      of the love of God known in Hinduism as <I>maha-bhava</I>. Worshipping in
      front of the statue of Kali, Ramakrishna would be overcome with such
      ecstatic love for the deity that he would fall to the ground and, immersed
      in spiritual trance, lose all consciousness of the external world. These
      experiences of God-intoxication became so frequent that he was relieved of
      his duties as temple priest but allowed to continue living within the
      temple compound. During the next twelve years Ramakrishna would journey
      ever deeper into this passionate and absolute love of the divine. His
      practice was to express such intense devotion to particular deities that
      they would physically manifest to him and then merge into his being. The
      various forms of god and goddess such as Shiva, Kali, Radha-Krishna,
      Sita-Rama, Christ and Mohammed frequently appeared to him and his fame as
      an <I>avata</I>r, or divine incarnation, rapidly spread throughout India.
      Ramakrishna died in 1886 at the age of fifty but his life, his intense
      spiritual practices, and the temple of Kali where many of his ecstatic
      trances occurred continued to attract pilgrims from all over India and the
      world. While Ramakrishna grew up and lived within the domain of Hinduism,
      his experience of the divine went far beyond the bounds of that, or any
      other, religion. Ramakrishna fully realized the infinite and all-inclusive
      nature of the divine. He was a conduit for divinity into the human world
      and the presence of that divinity may still be clearly experienced at the
      Kali temple of Dakshineswar.
