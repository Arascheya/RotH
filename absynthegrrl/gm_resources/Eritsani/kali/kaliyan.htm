<p>The<i> Dakshinakali</i> yantra conforms to the general pattern of all Shakti yantras
but has its own particular form. In the centre is a group of five triangles. Each point
represents one of the fifteen<i> Kali Nityas</i> or eternities, one for each day of the
waning Moon. In the eight petals are eight <i>Bhairavas</i> and eight<i> Bhairavis</i>,
coupling together. Bhairava means terrifying, and these couples are particularised aspects
of Dakshina Kalika, conforming to the eight tantrik directions. This is also the Kaula
circle where males and females congregate on one of the dark days of the Moon to perform
their uncanny rites. Each subsidiary Kali Nitya has her own yantra and mantra conforming
to the nature of each of the days of the dark fortnight of the Moon.<br>
