      <H2>Shri Kalika Devi</H2><FONT size=-1><I>O Mother, even a dullard becomes
      a poet who meditates upon thee raimented with space, three-eyed, creatrix
      of the three worlds, whose waist is beautiful with a girdle made of
      numbers of dead men's arms, and who on the breast of a corpse, as thy
      couch in the cremation ground, enjoyest Mahakala - <B>Karpuradistotra, VII
      (Woodroffe tr)</B></I>
      <P>Kali's paramount place of worship is in the cremation ground,
      preferably at the dead of night, on a suitable day of the waning Moon.
      Here, her nature becomes clear and apparent. For an adept in the worship,
      the whole world is a cremation ground, and She, the true form of time, who
      by herself creates and destroys all, is personified as the pyre. There,
      after life, all mortals and their wishes, dreams and reflections come to
      their fruition, a pile of worthless ashes.
      <P><IMG align=right alt="Kalika Devi (c) Jan Bailey 1999"
      src="ShriKalikaDev/kalimata.gif"> If you're a six year old child
      in the West and watch cartoons on TV, you have an idea who Kali is. She
      appears in various shows - almost invariably as an evil demoness who the
      badly animated superhero has to conquer. This is highly insulting to many
      Hindus, who regard her as the Absolute itself.
      <P>Alone amongst all the tantrik deities, it is Kali who has captured the
      imagination of the West. But rather than reviled, she is revered by
      countless millions of people. Ramakrishna, the famous Indian sage and
      saint, was one of her devotees; Rabindranath Tagore another. It's no
      coincidence that both these great men came from Bengal, for it is there
      that she continues to receive oblations and offerings of flesh.
      Nevertheless, traces of her worship are found throughout India and former
      territories of India.
      <P>Her bad reputation in the West probably sprang from her association
      with the cult of the Thuggees, forcefully suppressed by the British during
      the days of empire. The Thuggees - the word gave rise to our word thug -
      were actually Muslims who took the goddess Kali as their tutelary deity.
      They specialised in ensnaring and then robbing and murdering travellers.
      Originally, they were only supposed to attack male travellers and in their
      latter days attributed their downfall to the fact they had started to kill
      woman travellers too.
      <P>But Kali pre-dates the Thuggees, quite possibly by several thousands of
      years. No one truly knows her origin. She does, however, have an uncanny
      and an ambiguous image. Modern pictures of her show her standing on the
      dead body of her consort Shiva, with four arms, a necklace of fifty human
      skulls, a girdle of human arms, holding an axe, a trident, a severed human
      head and a bowl of blood. Around her rages a battle - she herself is the
      colour of a thundercloud. Her protruding tongue drips with the fresh blood
      of her enemies.
      <P>But this image is simply one of many, as we shall see. She is the
      goddess in her form as Dakshina Kalika - one of the most popular Bengali
      images of the goddess. Her guises are many, and include Bhadra
      (auspicious) Kali, Shmashana (cremation ground) Kali, Guhya (secret) Kali
      and a host of others. It is only in the great tantrik traditions that we
      find a clue to the real meaning of the gruesome images associated with
      Kalika. Although Hinduism was much reviled by early Western colonisers for
      its idolatry and pantheistic practices, this was a very narrow view.
      Tantrik texts repeatedly speak of the Devis or goddesses as being aspects
      of the one goddess. The same holds true for the male aspects. As
      individual humans all reflect the macrocosm, it's fair to describe the
      gods and goddesses of tantra as specialised aspects of ourselves - and,
      therefore, of life itself.
      <P>Yet life has its dark and its light sides. Death and love, in the
      tantrik tradition, are two sides of the same coin. As we look to the sky,
      we can see the Sun and Moon as symbols of male and female, of Shiva and
      Shakti. In the tantras, the Moon is often taken as a symbol of the Devi,
      whether in its dark or its bright fortnight. When She wanes, her images
      and her iconography become progressively more dark and fearsome. But when
      She waxes, so her images brighten. When she is full, She is Devi Tripura.
      Tripura is a name of the goddess meaning three cities. These allude to her
      own triple nature as a maiden (Bala) as a fecund woman (Tripura) and as a
      post-menstruating woman (Tripura Bhairavi).
      <P>Sir John Woodroffe (Arthur Avalon), writing in the <I>Garland of
      Letters</I>, says Kali is the deity in her aspect as withdrawing time into
      itself. "Kali is so called because She devours Kala (Time) and then
      resumes Her own dark formlessness." (<I>Garland of Letters</I>, page 235).
      Woodroffe says some have speculated that Kali was originally the Goddess
      of the Vindhya Hills, conquered by the Aryans. The necklace of skulls
      which makes up her image, he adds, are those of white people. Relying on
      the texts themselves, gives insight into the tantrik idea of Kali. In the
      <I>Kulachudamani Tantra </I>(KT), Lord Shiva asks questions answered by
      Devi, the goddess. It is, probably, one of the oldest tantras, according
      to Woodroffe, who published the Sanskrit text with an English introduction
      in his Tantrik Texts series.
      <P>In eight short chapters, Devi expounds the essence of her worship,
      sometimes in most beautiful imagery. But the uncanny side of Kaula and
      Kali worship is dwelt on in great detail, with references to siddhis -
      magical powers - including a mysterious process where the tantrik adept
      leaves his body at night, apparently so he can engage in sexual
      intercourse with Shaktis. Animal sacrifice also has a place in this
tantra.
      <P>The siddhis play a large part in the worship of the uncanny goddess
      Kali. The main tantrik rites are called the six acts (shatkarma) of
      pacifying, subjugating, paralysing, obstructing, driving away, and
      death-dealing. But the KT includes others such as Parapurapraveshana,
      which is the power of reviving a corpse, although according to some it
      means the ability to enter another's living body; Anjana, an ointment
      which lets a sadhaka see through solid walls; Khadga which gives
      invulnerability to swords; Khecari, which gives the power of flying and
      Paduka Siddhi, magical sandals which take you great distances, rather like
      seven league boots.
      <P>Certainly, the importance of having a suitable Shakti is important,
      according to the instructions Devi gives to Shiva. Devi here takes the
      form of Mahishamardini, more popularly known as Durga, who destroyed the
      two arch-demons Shumbha and Nishumbha in an epic battle between the
      goddess and the throng of demons. It was at this time, according to
      legend, that Durga created Kali, emanating her out of her third eye.
      <P>We learn more of Durga's legends and myths from the <I>Kalika
      Purana</I>. The Devi, Mahamaya, appeared as Bhadra Kali - identical with
      Mahishamardini - in order to slay the demon Mahisha. He had fallen into a
      deep sleep on a mountain and had a terrible dream in which BhadraKali cut
      asunder his head with her sword and drank his blood.
      <P>The demon started to worship Bhadra Kali and when Mahamaya appeared to
      him again in a later age to slaughter him again, he asked a boon of her.
      Devi replied that he could have his boon, and he asked her for the favour
      that he would never leave the service of her feet again. Devi replied that
      his boon was granted. "When you have been killed by me in the fight, O
      demon Mahisha, you shall never leave my feet, there is no doubt about it.
      In every place where worship of me takes place, there (will be worship) of
      you; as regards your body, O Danava, it is to be worshipped and meditated
      upon at the same time." (<I>Kalakikapurana</I>, ch.62, 107-108.)
      <P>For this reason, the image of Mahishamardini always has her trampling
      the buffalo Mahisha.
      <P>When She, the goddess, is dark, She is Devi Kalika, an equally high
      symbol of death and destruction. Throughout Her different manifestations
      and phases, She remains the one true goddess, Shakti, energy itself. She
      is symbolised by the yoni and the female cycle, which also shows waxing
      and waning throughout the month. Her spouse, Shiva, is symbolised by the
      Sun, by the phallus, by sperm, and as an emblem of consciousness without
      attributes. According to the tantrik phraseology "Only when Shiva is
      united with Shakti has Shiva power to act. Otherwise he is a corpse
      (shava)."
      <P>Another black deity of the Indian sub-continent has a close connection
      with Kali - Krishna. According to the <I>Kalivilasa Tantra</I>, he was
      born from the golden goddess Gauri, who turned black after she was hit by
      an arrow from the Hindu cupid, Kama.
      <P>Kali is Shakti, the great goddess, creating the three gunas: sattvas,
      rajas and tamas. The three gunas in their various permutation create all
      the fabric of the universe, including the five elements, skin, blood,
      etc..
      <P>These principles are the substance of she whose play (lila) is their
      modification. Kali is the first and foremost of the ten aspects of the
      goddess. She is pure sattvas, pure spirit.
      <P>A sadhaka (male) or a sadhvika (female) can worship the goddess -- the
      Devi -- in any of ten forms for the fruition of desires. Her ten major
      forms are Kali, Tara, Shodasi, Bhuvaneshvari, Bhairavi, Chinnamasta,
      Dhumavati, Bagala, Matangi and Kamala. These aspects are known as the ten
      mahavidyas.
      <P>To a sadhaka, to know these is to know the universe, as she is both
      space and time and beyond these categories. Each form has its own dhyana
      (meditation), yantra (diagram), mantra (sound form) and sadhana (actions).
      <P>Mahavidya Kali is the primordial Devi who is the root of all the Great
      Knowledges (mahavidya). Worshipped by sadhakas and sadhvikas, her outer
      forms are fearful. She destroys time, is time, and is the night of
      eternity.
      <P>Kali, certainly in the left hand tantrik tradition (vamachara), which
      is the path into Vama (woman and left) enters, is subject to much
      misunderstanding. The right hand path (dakshinachara) does not include the
      sexual component, while Vamachara allows sexual intercourse as part of her
      worship.
      <P>According to Sir John Woodroffe, in his introduction to the
      <I>Karpuradistotra</I>, which is a 22 verse hymn on Dakshina Kalika,
      pashus - those of a base disposition, are forbidden to engage in sexual
      sadhana at night. "The Pashu is still bound by the pasha (bonds) of
      desire, etc., and he is, therefore, not adhikari for that which, if
      undertaken by the unfit, will only make these bonds stronger." Verse 10 of
      the <I>Karpuradistotra</I> spells out the practice. "If by night, Thy
      devotee unclothed, with dishevelled hair, recites whilst meditating on
      Thee, thy mantra, when with his Shakti youthful, full-breasted, and
      heavy-hipped such an one makes all powers subject to him and dwells on the
      earth ever a seer." Worship of Kali is for the hero (vira) or a person of
      a highly spiritual nature (divya)
      <P>Kali's imagery is full of ambiguity, and this is deliberate on the part
      of the tantrik adepts who worshipped her.
      <P>As an example, according to some texts, the Kali sadhana takes place on
      a Tuesday, at midnight, in the cremation ground. Here, surrounded by
      jackals, owls and other uncanny creatures of the night, the sadhaka and
      his Shakti select a newly dead male corpse, which should be, according to
      the texts, of a young man preferably a king, a hero or a warrior. If he
      has recently died in battle, so much the better. Placing the corpse face
      downwards, the two draw the Kaliyantra on his back, offer each other food,
      wine and other good things, and then commence the act of ritual sex. At
      the close of intercourse, the man offers his Shakti one of her public
      hairs smeared with his semen and, if she is menstruating, blood.
      <P>Woodroffe says that the worship of Kali in the pashu mode is totally
      forbidden by Shiva, quoting the influential <I>Niruttara Tantra</I> as his
      source. "By the worship of Kali without Divyabhava and virabhava the
      worshipper suffers pain at every step and goes to hell. If a man who is of
      the Pashubhava worships Kali then he goes to the Raurava Hell until the
      time of final dissolution."
      <P>As to the matter of a suitable Shakti for the sexual rites of Kali, the
      NT suggests that when a sadhaka has already achieved success with his own
      Shakti, he may then worship another woman. But Woodroffe says this other
      woman is the supreme Shakti in the sadhaka's own body.
      <P>The cremation ground is often interpreted as the place where all
      desires are burnt away. Before realising kaivalya (liberation), the
      sadhaka must burn away all the taboos and conditionings which prevent this
      liberation.
      <P>The cremation ground (shmashana) is also the supreme nadi or channel
      within the human organism - the sushumna -- The central channel of
      bioenergy within the spine of a human being, the royal road of Kundalini.
      <P>There the Devi or goddess is coiled up three and a half times at the
      base of the spine. When she unfolds and enters the sushumna, the bliss of
      this cosmic orgasm causes the universe to disappear. On the sadhaka within
      the shmashana yantra is Shakti, both entwined in close sexual embrace. She
      is the human form of Kali, as he is the human form of Shiva. Both are
      forever united. The <I>Niruttara Tantra</I> says (2, 27) "The cremation
      ground is of two kinds, O Devi, the pyre and the renowned yoni. Shiva is
      the phallus, Kuleshani! So Mahakala said." Questioned later by Shri Devi
      in the same tantra, Shiva says that the vagina is Dakshina herself, in the
      form of the three gunas, the essence of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. These
      three forms represent the powers of creation, maintenance and destruction.
      They have their Shakti counterparts.
      <P>"When she has the semen of Shiva, she is Shiva-Shakti." (NT)
      <P>The <I>Karpuradistotra</I> comments on animal sacrifice. Male creatures
      may only be sacrificed to Kali, else she becomes furious. Verse 19 says
      that worshippers of Kali who sacrifice the flesh of cats, camels, sheep,
      buffaloes, goats and men to her become accomplished. A commentary by a
      Kaula, Vimalananda Svami, which Woodroffe only partially translates,
      claims these animals represent the six enemies with the goat representing
      lust, the buffalo anger, the cat greed, the sheep delusion, the camel
      envy. Man represents pride. However, according to other sources, only a
      king may perform the sacrifice of a man.
      <P>At the great temple of the Devi at Kamakhya in Assam, there is evidence
      that male human sacrifice was performed in the past. This site is renowned
      for Shakti worship because of a legend that Vishnu once cut the body of
      Shakti into 50 pieces with his discus. These parts represent the letters
      of the Sanskrit alphabet and are pithas (pedestals = sacred sites) of
      Devi. The yoni of Shakti fell at this spot, making it the most sacred of
      all.
      <P>Who, then, is Kali? Devi gives her own description in the
      <I>Kulachudamani</I>: "I am Great Nature, consciousness, bliss, the
      quintessence, devotedly praised. Where I am, there are no Brahma, Hara,
      Shambhu or other devas, nor is there creation, maintenance or dissolution.
      Where I am, there is no attachment, happiness, sadness, liberation,
      goodness, faith, atheism, guru or disciple.
      <P>"When I, desiring creation, cover myself with my Maya (The great power
      of Shakti to delude all created things through Her play, ed.) and become
      triple and ecstatic in my wanton love play, I am Vikarini, giving rise to
      the various things.
      <P>"The five elements and the 108 lingams arise, while Brahma and the
      other devas, the three worlds, Bhur-Bhuvah-Svah (the three worlds)
      spontaneously come into manifestation.
      <P>"By mutual differences of Shiva and Shakti, the (three) gunas
      originate. All things, such as Brahma and so forth, are my parts, born
      from my being. Dividing and blending, the various tantras, mantras and
      kulas manifest. After withdrawing the five fold universe, I, Lalita,
      become of the nature of nirvana. Once more, men, great nature, egoism, the
      five elements, sattvas, rajas and tamas become manifested. This universe
      of parts appears and is then dissolved.
      <P>"O All-Knowing One, if I am known, what need is there for revealed
      scriptures and sadhana? If I am unknown, what use for puja and revealed
      text? I am the essence of creation, manifested as woman, intoxicated with
      sexual desire, in order to know you as guru, you with whom I am one. Even
      given this, Mahadeva, my true nature still remains secret."
      <P>The <I><A href="http://www.hubcom.com/tantric/yogini.htm">Yogini Tantra
      </A></I>describes the goddess as the cosmic mother (Vishvamata), dark as a
      thunderstorm, wearing a garland and waistband of skulls, with dishevelled
      hair, completely naked (digambaram).
      <P>She has a rolling tongue, makes a terrifying roar, three reddened eyes,
      and has a wide open mouth. She wears a moon digit on her forehead, has the
      corpses of two boys as her earrings, and is adorned with various gems,
      which are of the brightness of the Sun and the Moon.
      <P>
      <P>Laughing loudly, she has two streams of blood pouring from her mouth,
      while her throat is red with blood. In her four arms she holds cleaver,
      head, and makes mudras dispelling fears and granting boons. She, the
      supreme Nitya, is seated in reverse (viparita) intercourse with Mahakala
      upon the corpse of Shiva. The whole scene is set in the cremation ground.
      <P>Yet, as with most other tantrik symbolism, the meaning of this
      cremation pyre operates on multiple levels. The pyre is also the yoni. Sir
      John Woodroffe (Arthur Avalon), says Kali is the deity in her aspect as
      withdrawing time into itself. "Kali is so called because She devours Kala
      (Time) and then resumes Her own dark formlessness."<I> Garland of Letters
      </I>, page 235.
