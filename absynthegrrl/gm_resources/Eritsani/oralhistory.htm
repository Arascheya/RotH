<p class="pagecaption">Eritsani Oral Histories</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">(from Kara)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Basics: Started as a group of 'undesirables’ forced into space based work when it became dangerous. Businesses had ‘privatized’ space and were working from bottom line concepts. The original Eritsani banded together to fight awful working conditions this created.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We began as a loose grouping of space workers. In the beginning space was the realm of the best and brightest. Military pilots, scientists, and engineers were the very first people involved in space exploration. Then, as more activity occurred, so did the dangers and accidents. When the first stations were built around the birth world they began to require many workers to accomplish the tasks. Those in power turned to recruiting segments of the populace they considered expendable for the really dangerous things. These people, mostly men at first, banded together and formed a union to demand safer conditions and better equipment. As more stations were built and resource mining began on various other bodies in the system their numbers grew and began to include more women. After a particularly disastrous event while working on one of the l-point stations seven of the strongest leaders formed a council of war. Through tactics legal and illegal they forced through regulations and provisions for safety and workers rights. Six of these went on to become the founding mothers of the Eritsani as a race. The seventh, the greatest of them, Kalimayani Karakinska, was killed not long after during battles that allowed Eritsani to settle on some of the asteroids. Her sister, Illani Ramachandra lent the seventh name to the term Eritsani. Eritsani itself means of the Eritsan, of the original mothers. It is from this that our tradition of the seven families and the matriarchal nature of our society comes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When the generation ships were first launched our people signed on in droves. Here was a chance to go somewhere on our own. Do something for ourselves. At first many of us were looking for a homeland, but then the generation ships got into our blood. We came to crave the freedom of movement, the search for something even better deeper in the void. Sure, the trips between worlds were long, and there were many problems. There were some customs that came into being because of the hardness of the void. Things Groundlings don't understand, having never faced the constant threat of death in the void. </p>
<p class="regtxt5">We began to slide bits and pieces into our own holdings, building our own ships and stations, when the asteroid mines grew in popularity we began to come into our own. Now we could create places of our own. At least until the Groundlings wanted them for something else...</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">The First Mother - Kalimayani Karakinska</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She is shrouded in mystery. All that is known over her comes down to us through legends. She is painted as a ruthless, blood-thirsty demoness who single handedly formed the original 7 clans. It is believed she began life as Elena Ramachandra, at least that is what the Ramachandra clan believes. She is credited with so many activities in the legends that the less traditional of us believe she is an amalgam of several people acting together during that time.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Elena Ramachandra</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is much to tell of Kalimayani Karakinska. She was wise woman, leader, saint, but she didn't start out that way. At first she was Elena Ramachandra, a steel fitter and welder on one of the construction crews. She was quiet, kept to herself and tried to stay out of the politics. That was until she was nearly killed in a major decompression. She was the only survivor in her section. She had managed to dive into an in tact room and get the pressure door shut during the disaster. Once she had healed from that she changed her name and became a demon about forcing change. She was the most ruthless and bloody of the bunch. It is said she was responsible for the deaths of 30 company representatives and politicians until they finally agreed to negotiate with the newly formed council. She is also said to have had several of the stronger union leaders beaten nearly to death until the male dominated trade unions joined forces with the council of seven she had brought together. Even the oral histories are sketchy about all that happened during this time. It wasn't until later that several of us went back and gathered together the stories of our beginnings. There are enough inconsistencies to where it is generally thought by the less traditional of us that Kalimayani was a conglomeration of the activities of several people during that time. There are just so many things she is supposed to have done all by herself in a short span of years.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">The Clans</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kalimayani forged the original 7 clans from her seven strongest allies. These seven became the first mothers of their clans. Kalimayani’s absence from this group is one of the reasons the less traditional believe her to be an amalgam of several people active during the formation of the people. As time passed and they bore children and those children bore children the power blocks became clans in more than just name. The term Eritsan is derived from the names of these first mothers. They were:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Erinson, Anne-Marie</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Ramachandra, Illani</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Ishihara, Sara</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Trask, Demona</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Sato, Talisa</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Andropov, Tatyana</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Negovyev, Ellaina</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is an eighth clan, the Karakinska, named for the First Mother. These are the Arbiters, the dispensers of the ky’ris. Their decisions are the final word of the Eritsani. They are also the shadow stalkers that enforce Eritsani interests when non-Eritsani seek to harass and injure those of the people. Induction into the Karakinska is based on honor and integrity in dealing with the people and the recommendation of their peers. Decision for final inclusion comes from the rest of the Karakinska.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Traditions</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When a girl child is born the wise mother of her social unit performs a reading for her. This wise mother may be the wise mother of the ship, colony, or other political unit. This reading is supposed to reveal aspects of her future and her place in the clan. There are cases where the wise mother does not feel she can read for the daughter, then the wise mother of the clan performs it. If this wise mother feels she cannot give a true reading she will defer to the wise mother of the Eritsani. The reading must be performed in the first year after birth to have any validity. This still allows time to travel to a wise mother if the local one is not comfortable doing the reading.</p>
