<p class="regtxt5">The Eyrines is a .5.7mm  submachine gun modeled on the Belgian Fabrique Nationale FN P-90. These production line mystical guns have minor cosmetic differences from their prototype, including a more ergonomic butt stock and slightly longer barrel than their Belgian counterparts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An emblem of a stern-faced winged woman, carrying a sword in one hand and a scourge in the other, a representation of the Greek Furies, is stamped on the weapon’s butt stock, and glows with a cobalt radiance when in the presence of evil. Many of Department Seven’s elite agents and demon hunters use some version of this deadly, anti-supernatural weapon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When used against outsiders as well as any sentient creature who has ever raped another sentient creature, of any species or gender, the Eyrines does additional damage. If the gun is brought within 60 ft of any creature who meets either of these criteria, the symbol inscribed on the butt stock begins glowing faintly. The gun’s default statistics are described below.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Against outsiders, the Eyrines inflicts 2d10 points of ballistic damage, and is considered a magic weapon for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. If the target has ever raped another thinking creature, the weapon receives +1 on attack and damage rolls against that target. There is no maximum cap on damage that can be inflicted in this manner, making the Eyrines an ideal weapon for dispatching elder oni and human predators.</p>
