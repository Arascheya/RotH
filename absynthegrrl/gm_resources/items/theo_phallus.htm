<p class="pagecaption">Theotokotic Phallus</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Theotokotic Phallus is an ancient and primal magic, first recorded in European proto-history. Reports of the Phallus can be found lurking between the lines of ancient myths and even some heretical Christian legends.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In some stories the Theotokotic Phallus is a wooden rod anointed with holy oils; in others it is a weathered stone penis broken off the statue of some long forgotten fertility god, in other tales, it is a simple witch’s broom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The details change, but the core truth of the story is always the same: a woman who takes the Phallus into her body will bear a god-kissed child, a child (always a son) of profound destiny.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Any woman who masturbates with the Phallus can conceive an especially blessed child. The child is physically ordinary, except for some small signs of his benevolent divine heritage. The son always possesses the Racial Exotica feat and at least one other bonus feat of choice; alternatively, the child might be a member of a magical meta-human race.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The exact details of the child’s mystical birth are left to individual game masters.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While carrying the semi-divine child, the mother receives a +3 divine bonus on all saving throws, and gains Fast Healing 1, the better to protect the godly new life in her womb.</p>
