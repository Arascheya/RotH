<p class="pagecaption">Lady Raven Pseudo-wings</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lady Raven is the trade name shared by a collective of several Gothic artists, all of whom produce decorative wings for their cos-players. Lady Raven wings range from cute miniature wings to impressive, fully articulated wings with a span as long as a man’s arm. Some of the pseudo-wings are incredibly realistic with integrated real or faux feathers, others are stylized creations of brightly colored fur and inflatable plastic. One of the most famous of Lady Raven’s pseudo-wings are spindly, skeletal wings made of found objects like bleached bones, car parts, and circuitry components. This legendary design has been imitated dozens of times, producing many non-magical imitations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Wearing an ensorcelled  pair of Lady Raven Pseudo-wings grants the wearer a +2 morale bonus on Jump and Knowledge: arcane lore checks. Wearing a pair of the famous Junk Angel Wings grants those bonuses as well as several magical benefits. Junk Angel wings grant the wearer a ?ight speed of 30 ft (poor), which only works after sunset. The flight speed increases to 60 ft (average) during moonless nights. During daylight hours, the Junk Angel’s wearer is considered to be under the effects of a permanent feather fall spell.
