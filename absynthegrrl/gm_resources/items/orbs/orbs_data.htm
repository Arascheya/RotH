<p class="pagecaption">Orbs of Power - Data</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Formerly known as the Orbs of Law</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Orbs are seven artifacts of great power. Only one instance exists in the multi-verse. The incredible power of these items has spawned echo-orbs, imperfect <a href="shadow_orbs.htm">shadow images</a>, of the originals. These shadows can be used to find the Orb of Direction, the first of the seven.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Orbs will create various effects depending on the intent of the wielder and the purpose of the particular Orb. For an example: the Orb of Harmony will increase harmony and good feelings if used by a good intentioned person. It will decrease harmony and increase strife and aggression if wielded by a person desiring that outcome.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Orb of Direction is located at the center of the Kali Yuga temple, which can only be accessed with the complete ritual described in the <A href="../books/book_blood.htm">Ankzmetze ra Mahklahzkna Nilikhnamaz</a> (the Book of Blood Power in the <a href="../../info/languages/lang_destruct.htm">Destructor tongue</a>). Various copies of these exist throughout the multi-verse, always found with a shadow orb, however, no single book is completely correct. To accurately decipher the location of the Kali Yuga temple requires seven unique versions of the book and correct interpretation of the passages within.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Orbs can be used to reinforce the seals on the <a href="../../gods/creator.htm">Creator</a> and <a href="../../gods/destructor.htm">Destructor</a>. They can also be used to undo these seals and release them into the multi-verse. This ability to create or remove seals can also be applied to <a href="../../gates_inx.htm">Gates</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Style this concept after the one in Ninth Gate where the correct passages are tagged in a subtely different manner from the non-valid passages.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider - Orbs of Law could have effects like the Rod of 7 Parts - enhancements when several orbs are together */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider - does the Destructor have only the one item, or are there more? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* also - what about the Greater Powers? do each of the three have item(s) associated with them? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Orbs of Evil exist that mirror the Orbs of Law - if these are brought together they will teleport each other away in a titanic flash of energy - need to set the parameters for this energy burst. */</p>
