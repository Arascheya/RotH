<p class="sectioncaption">OLD VERSION - Fairbanks Campaign</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Prologue</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Razak treachery has decimated us but a vision from the Creator indicates this is not the Conflict of the Prophecy. The vision further indicates we must record the following "clues" about the Orbs of Law to guide those who seek them during the final stages of the Conflict. From least to greatest is the best of ways, yet greatest to least may serve as well.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Search</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Orb of Direction shall be found as it was in the beginning at the shrine of fertility where it is used to cure the sick and barren.  It may only be obtained by trade for a Bio Chemical Analyser/Med Pack.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Orb Of Harmony resides deep within the Caverns of History beneath the legendary Gardens of Lazaar protected by many and varied beasts and traps.  Beware the curse of the dust.  The card of Centipedes and Silver Worms can aid you greatly.  It contains the runes KKC and may be found within the room of the children guarded by men of tin.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In the place where humans are not human will you find the Orb of Theft. In dread Akhalt, in the Galai Waste, where power-mad sorcerers called down death to their undying lament does it lie. There beneath the devastation shall it be found.  It sits beneath The Hand of the Destructor, under the watchful gaze of The Eye. Twins shall grant you access and twins shall grant you safety.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">An experiment gone wrong, a stranded Lord of Time, a blood consumer, old love, new evil, all vie to possess power and crystals. Here the Orb of Envy lies heavy on a town on a Web of Demons. It once was the domain of Ishrathel, but now is watched by violet eyes. Beware all is not as it seems.  Friend is foe and foe is friend.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This time into the very depths of the Cavernxs of History, seeking in the Hall of Confusing Chambers, below the Dust, below the Sun Chambers, above the Horrors. Here is found the Orb of Death. Ships logs can tell of more than seas.  Beware maned heads.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Within the bowels of the Blue Moon is found the Orb of Waste.  The Sphinx Webs or Fiery Chariot are the ways to the Base of the Blue Moon.  The hidden monastery of infinity is said to be the port of Fiery Chariots.  The inner mysteries will only be revealed to the holder of the Centipede of Purpose, The Scarab of Power, and the Swirling Stone of Knowledge.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The High Orb, The Orb of Ertan, the Orb of the Creator, is held by the Usurper of Spiders. Within the Web of Demons may he sometimes be found. He also resides in the depths of the void, where dimensions warp and bend, where time flows to a different end.</p>
