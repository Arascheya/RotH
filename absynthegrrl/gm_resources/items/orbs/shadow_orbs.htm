<p class="pagecaption">Shadow Orbs</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the <a href="../../gods/creator.htm">Creator</a> was imprisoned by the Greater Powers, it began to send out visions of items that could be used to release it. These visions spun out through the multi-verse and coallesced into the <a href="orbs_data.htm">True Orbs of Power</a> and the Bowl of Purity. The power of these thoughts also created many shadow versions of the same items. The shadow versions cannot release the <a href="../../gods/creator.htm">Creator</a>, but they are very powerful in their own right, although the powers are tweaked and warped from the intent of the <a href="orbs_data.htm">True Orbs</a> and Bowl.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These are echoes of the Orbs of Law. They have similar effects at reduced power. There are two types of these, one is a set of orbs that most closely mirror the powers of the originals, and the others that imperfectly mimic the originals. Collecting all seven close mirrors will be able to use the information in the <A href="../books/book_blood.htm">Ankzmetze ra Mahklahzkna Nilikhnamaz</a> to find the Kali Yuga Temple and recover the Orb of Direction.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The only way to correctly determine the accuracy of the Shadow Orbs is by comparison with others of the same type. Shadow Orbs are scattered throughout the multi-verse. Some information exists on them in obscure texts scattered in libraries and collections.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../npcs/lady_a.htm">Lady Ayrthane</a> is one of the few people who has enough knowledge of the Orbs to know of the Shadow Orbs, the originals, and how to begin looking for them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first "true" shadow orb is the Orb of Visions, this Orb will induce anything from simple visions of lost items to nightmares while awake depending on the psychic abilities, force of will, and stability of the person(s) within range of it.</p>
