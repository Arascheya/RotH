<p class="pagecaption">Otome’s Slip</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Otome’s Slip is a loose and comfortable ensorcelled house kimono. When worn by any female who is either in the Young Adult age category or still sexually inexperienced, the Slip provides a constant, comforting protection against the attentions of demonic predators.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If worn by a young, virginal girl, the Slip radiates a subtle protective aura. Any outsider with an alliance to evil cannot approach closer than 10 ft to the girl while she sleeps or if she ever falls unconscious. All attacks, both mundane and magical stop instantly just before they would touch the girl’s skin. While the girl is awake, she receives a +2 bonus on all saving throws made against the supernatural effects and spells of evil aligned outsiders.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If any evil outsider ever touches or wears the Slip, that creature suffers a negative level. The negative level remains as long as the Slip is in hand or worn, and disappears when the slip is no longer being touched. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but cannot be overcome in any way (such as by restoration spells) while the Slip is touched.</p>
