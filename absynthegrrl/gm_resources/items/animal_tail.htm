<p class="pagecaption">Animal Play Tail</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She had to walk with a silicon cock sticking in her ass and one in her cunt. A butterfly strapped down to her clit but who’s got the remote control?" -  NOFX, Louise</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An animals innocence and playfulness can steal over a human, as can their form and unique abilities. Animal Play Tails are used in physically transformative sexual play, allowing a willing human to take an inhuman form.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Each Animal Play Tail is handcrafted, using human and animal hair, textured and dyed to perfectly replicate the tail of the creature the user will transform into. Tigers, horses, dogs and squirrels, each tail lovingly recreates the textures of the fur, creating a sensual work of art. Some strange Animal Play Tails incorporate a peacock’s feathery train, or a fish’s iridescent scales. Whatever the Tail’s form, it is affixed to a short wooden or leather phallus.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The tail is inserted anally or (more rarely) vaginally, and the user masturbates to orgasm using the tail, which takes several minutes. The user can wear the tail indefinitely. While the tail is worn, the user can transform her body as a full round  action, transforming into the animal emulated by that specific tail.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While in animal form, the Tail’s owner uses the physical abilities (STR, DEX and CON scores) of her animal form. She retains her base attack bonus, base save progressions  and class abilities, assuming they are usable in animal form.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She gains the animal form’s unique sensory and extraordinary capabilities. The Tail’s owner retains her mental abilities (INT, WIS and CHA) while in animal form, albeit in a weakened state. She cannot use any abilities requiring concentration, nor any INT based skill while in animal form.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Tail’s owner can transform into animal form once per day, and can retain her altered state indefinitely. When the user decides to return to human form, she simply concentrates on regaining her humanity, and the tail falls free of her body.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Each Animal Play Tail is handcrafted to replicate a specific creature of the animal or a mammal of the vermin type. Even rarer Tails are known to exist, allowing the wearer to take the form of even more exotic, mystical beasts. If one of these Chimerical Tails can be found, increase the purchase DC by +5 if it allows the user to transform into a creature from the Magical Beast type, or by +10 if it allows the user to transform into an Aberration or even stranger creature. Draconic Tails are items of legend, with a purchase DC of at least 40, and often far more.</p>
