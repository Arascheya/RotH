<p class="pagecaption">Moon Stones</p>
<p class="regtxt5">These stones are actually a set of hyperdrive control crystals for a Mark 3 experimental drive system. They are smaller than a set for a standard unit, measuring only an inch in diameter. There a seven of them, each with its own enchantment. These are the stones used by Tesch Mar when he exiled the Lizard Kings. They require the backpack controller and hand unit that Thock is carrying in the Madison game. Otherwise the controller is in the ruined cities area under the care of a noble family there. (figure this out and place for Valen)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tesch Mar added magical capabilities to each stone as well as a synergistic effect when all were used together. He had hidden them shortly before his battle with Nyigroth. Raisilian was the only other person to know their location.</p>
