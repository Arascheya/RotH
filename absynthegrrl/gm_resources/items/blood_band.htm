<p class="pagecaption">Motherblood Bandings</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Clean strips of white linen, blessed by a priestess/midwife of the old traditions, washed in water from a pure source are bound tightly around a young woman’s thighs and vulva. The magically active strips absorb the woman’s fluids, synchronize with the ebb and flow of her life force, and with time, empower the woman with a knowledge of her body and its capabilities. Eventually the bandings come to a kind of life, symbiotically feeding on her blood and waste.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A woman wearing a Motherblood Banding gains the benefit of the Moonwise and Cyclic Ferocity feats, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. The woman must wear the Bandings continuously for at least 16 hours each day for a month before she gains the article’s benefit.</p>
