<p class="pagecaption">Black Asylum Bandings</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Wrapped tight around the face like the bandages around a burn victim, Black Asylum Bandings carry a powerful curse. The bandings empower their wearer, giving the creature feral strength and a predator’s determination, but at the cost of sanity, mercy and eventually, humanity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Black Asylum Bandings resemble thick white gauze strips wrapped tightly around the face and head, so only the eyes, nostrils and mouth are exposed. As the wearer draws on their power, the Bandings mutilate his face and mind; blood splatters and dark black stains move slowly across the face, seemingly at random.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While wearing the Black Asylum Bandings, a creature receives a +4 bonus to CON, which increases his hit points by 2 per level/HD, as well as providing a +2 bonus on FORT saves. The Bandings grant their wearer access to the Barbaric Rage feat, even if the creature does not normally meet the prerequisites. When attacking with natural weapons, a creature wearing the Bandings receives a +3 bonus on damage rolls.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Bandings Asylum Bandings slowly transforms its wearer into a monster, a creature whose soul is as twisted and angry as his deformed features. Each day the Bandings are worn, the creature suffers 1d3 points of temporary WIS and CHA drain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Each day, the wearer must succeed at a WILL save (DC 10) or suffer 1 point of permanent WIS and CHA drain instead. The creature’s WIS and CHA scores can never fall below 3 as a result of the Bandings’ dark influence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Each point of WIS or CHA permanently lost to the bandings requires the wearer to succeed at a second WILL Save (DC 10) or have their primary allegiance change to evil, or selfishness.</p>
