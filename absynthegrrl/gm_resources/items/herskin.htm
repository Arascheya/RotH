<p class="pagecaption">Herskin</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Herskin is living symbiotic armor, demonic ultratechnology from a science mankind can’t understand or easily replicate. Herskin seeds are highly coveted artifacts, worth incredible amounts to Black Tokyo’s militaries and secretative black ops clans. In it’s dormant state, a Herskin egg resembles a pulsing, peach like fruit made of  rubbery black skin, covered in strange translucent ichor that stings like nettles when touched. Only males can wear and bond with Herskin, balancing and complementing the dark armor’s feminine nature.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To don a suit of Herskin, a male must strip nude and penetrate the hungry, sexually voracious Herskin egg. As he nears orgasm, the egg pulses with life, and at the moment of climax, the Herskin egg bursts, spreading black ichor across his body. Feeding tubes enter the male’s urethra and anus, while Herskin barbs pierce veins and arteries, joining the symbiotic armor to its host.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Herskin quickly hardens, transforming into a dark and angular carapace which covers the host from head to toe. The Herskin’s impressive cranial crests and mandibles resemble a rhino beetles, and the host’s eyes are hidden behind multiple clusters of spiderlike compound eyes. The Herskin is normally jet black and dark grey, but the carapace shifts color to a blood red when the host is enraged or aroused.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Herskin is a demonic symbiote that feeds on the host in exchange for raw physical power. Each day the Herskin is worn, the host suffers 1d3 points of temporary CON drain, as well as one point of temporary CHA drain, making the suit impractical and dangerous for long wear. While wearing the suit, the host requires at least twice as much food and water as any other humanoid of equivalent size.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Donning the Herskin requires at least 10 minutes. Removing a Herskin requires an act of will, and a full round action. The host is nauseated for 1d3 hours after removing the Herskin seed. The Herskin returns to its dormant egg state when not in use, waiting for another chance to serve.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While wearing the Herskin, the host receives a +4 enhancement bonus to STR, a +2 enhancement bonus to DEX, and a +6 natural armor bonus to defense. The Herskin grants its host low light vision and the scent special quality.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Herskin possesses a natural bite attack, which deals 1d6 points of piercing damage, and threatens a critical hit on a natural 19-20 as a secondary attack. The Herskin’s talons inflict 1d8 points of slashing damage, and threaten a critical hit on a natural 20.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While wearing the Herskin, the host has access to the following Hentai feats, even if he does not normally meet the prerequisites:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Barbaric Rage<br/>
Combat Martial Arts<br/>
Combat Reflexes<br/>
Enraged Armory or Phallic Spear Technique</p>
