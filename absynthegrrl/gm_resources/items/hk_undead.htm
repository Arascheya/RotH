<p class="regtxt5">(Baku Call Charmlets - original concept from Black Tokyo)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In a land as crowded as Japan, the dead walk shoulder to shoulder with the living. Ghosts are common as stray cats, and most are no more harmful. A few are terrors, who stalk and prey on the living. Whether the unquiet spirits are benign or rapacious, few of Black Tokyo’s citizens possess the supernatural insight to see them. Warning devices, wards and charms become necessary.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Baku Call Charmlets are surprisingly common. These extremely minor supernatural devices are ensorcelled versions of the ever-present cartoon charms dangling from schoolgirl’s backpacks and cell phone lanyards. As undead draw near, the charm begins jingling faintly, shaking the zipper or cord it is attached to, providing a subtle, almost unnoticeable of the presence of undead. If connected to a cell phone, the phone begins to vibrate, and a phantom phone number flashes on the screen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The charm begins to shake and vibrate if any undead creature, including invisible and ethereal undead creatures approaches within 60 ft.</p>
