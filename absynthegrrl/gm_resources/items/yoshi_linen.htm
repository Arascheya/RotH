<p class="pagecaption">Yoshiwara Linens</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There lie pleasure houses scattered across Japan which serviced the diayomo’s court, brought sexual relief to samurai and companionship to wealthily merchants. Some still exist today, passed down from owner to owner across the generations; others are ruins standing in crumbling feudal towns, overgrown by the 21st century and forgotten.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Strips of moldering cloth from these ancient houses of prostitution are stitched into ?ne bed linens. Thousand count sheets are marked by ancient tantric magic.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anyone making love on a bed fitted with a set of Yoshiwara Linens automatically benefits from the Tantric Wisdom feat even if he or she doesn’t meet the prerequisites. Echoes of Japan’s erotic past whisper in the lovers’ ears, granting them an additional +1d4 insight bonus on all Knowledge: history checks made concerning Japan’s history.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Similar cloths are rumored exist, incorporating threads from ancient European or American bordellos. These cloths would provide a similar bonus concerning their own country’s history.</p>
