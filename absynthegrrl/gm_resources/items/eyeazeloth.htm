<p class="pagecaption">Eye of Azeloth</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This item is the left eye of the priest Azeloth, high priest of the destructor. It appears as a small stone or jewel with markings that make it look like an eye. If it is picked up it will immediately seek to take control of its new owner in a power + int vs power + int attack against its owner. If it is successfull the owner will immediately gouge out its left eye and press this item into the empty socket. Once in place the eye will become flesh and begin working its evil will through its host.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The eye seeks the recovery of the <a href="eye_destruct.htm">Eye of the Destructor</a> and then the release of the <a href="../gods/destructor.htm">Destructor</a> from where it was imprisoned.</p>
