<p class="regtxt5">The H-Book is the  sketchbook of a master hentai artist, printed on high quality paper and decorated with pen and ink, pencil and Copic sketch markers. Each of the thin comic book’s pages is dominated with a full page illustration of some breathtaking fantasy girl.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Each of the H-books 22 to 48 pages contains a ‘ready-made’ Daydream Girl; the Daydream Girl has a single Ordinary character level, starting attributes of 8, and has 18 or more ranks in Craft: visual arts to distribute among her six attributes. The Daydream Girl’s attributes are chosen at the moment of her creation, by whoever reads the book. The reader/viewer’s fantasies shape the girl and the personality he imagines the drawing to have.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The book’s reader can summon a Daydream Girl as a full round action, by simply touching the book and concentrating. The Daydream Girl obeys the book’s reader as if he or she is her master, and the reader can choose to expend XP to make her real. A particular reader can only summon one Daydream Girl per day from the book.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once one of the H-book’s charges is expended, that Daydream Girl’s sketch becomes a non-magical work of art. When all the H-Book’s charges are expended it becomes a non-magical comic book, with little intrinsic value.</p>
