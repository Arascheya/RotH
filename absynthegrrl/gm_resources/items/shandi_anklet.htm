<p class="pagecaption">Anklet</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Material: Gold, Amethyst</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Period: 3rd Dynasty</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Reign: Djoser</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Value: 1000 gold - 10000 gold to a vampyr</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Notes:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Given to <a href="../npcs/shandi.htm">Shandi</a> by <a href="../npcs/angelique.htm">Angelique</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This anklet contains a powerful memory focusing and enhancing spell. It also contains a blood purification and renewal spell. The blood renewal will allow a vampyr to only have to feed half as often as normal. It will also allow a living person to resist all blood based poisons and will increase their stamina by half again, since the blood renewal will also clean up fatigue poisons.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This item along with the balancing effects of the Bracers of the Assassin has helped Shandi to become more awake and functional.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The anklet will survive vampyr destruction. It is a Major Artifact. This item was developed very late in the Probe Project by the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a>. It is an expansion item for the user/owner of the Probe Controller, <a href="talis_anubis.htm">Angelique's Necklace</a>. It was developed by the end team, the ones desperately trying to stem the tide of vampyrites and other first generation nanotech that was threatening their home-world.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Each gold bead is an expansion memory location if the wearer also possesses the Probe Controller, twenty-two expansion locations total. Mereret has Hatshepsut and Angelique backed up in two of them. If need be she will borrow it back from Shandi long enough to upload new copies to the necklace. The other nodes are empty.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Full nodes can only be cleared if this item is worn be the wearer of the Necklace of the Mother. The method of clearing is to transfer the data into an empty crystal in the necklace. Data can also be transfered in a non-destructive copy kind of function. Angelique has used this several times when she has cleared the necklace and then added the image of Hatshepsut back into the first storage gem.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Empty nodes can be used as power store crystals by the wearer if they are inclined to use spells. The capacity of each empty node is 15 power points.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The anklet is linked to <a href="talis_anubis.htm">Angelique's Necklace</a>. The two items can locate one another at the request of their owners.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To destroy this item it must be eaten by nanite reducers of the appropriate type. Currently the only source is on the dead world where Mereret's sire originally contracted the vampyrites.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This item is based on an anklet that belonged to Mereret, Daughter of Senusert III. See <a href="http://www.touregypt.net/egyptmuseum/egyptian_museumR4.htm">article</a> at <a href="http://www.touregypt.net">Tour Egypt</a></p>
