<p class="pagecaption">Oni-bane Ribbons</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Too many weapons are all but useless against supernatural evil. Oni can shrug off high caliber annihilation, laugh off otherwise lethal katana strokes. Encircling weapons is expensive and time consuming, and if the weapon is ever lost or destroyed, the effort is wasted. Black Tokyo’s military demonologists devised a unique solution.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oni-bane Ribbons are colorful cloth ribbons inscribed with prayers and arcane formula, which can be wrapped around the handle of any weapon: they can be tied around the hilt of a sword, wrapped around an axe handle, or tied tight around a AR-15’s grip with equal ease.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Multiple ribbons of different colors can be tied around a single weapon to enhance its capacities. The same ribbon can be tied and untied dozens of times, ‘hot-swapping’ between weapons and bestowing their temporary enchantments as needed. Wrapping a Ribbon around a hilt or removing it is a full round action, which provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Black and White Cord: Two thin cords, one of each color are twined together to produce this powerful fetish. When used to attack any outsider, the weapon or its ammunition has its critical threat range increased by 1.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Blood Cord: This deep red and brown cloth ribbon grants the weapon or its ammunition a +2 enchantment bonus on damage rolls against outsiders and corporeal undead. This cord always smells faintly of old blood, and occasionally drips blood.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Blue Ribbon: This blue silk ribbon is usually decorated with green or white scale patterns silk-screened onto the fabric. A weapon wrapped in this ribbon grants a +2 enchantment bonus on attack rolls made against outsiders.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Eyrines Ribbon: This black and pink cloth ribbon helps soldiers hunt human monsters. Once per minute, any weapon (or ammunition fired from a weapon) wrapped with this cord can inflict an additional die of damage, if the target has ever raped a sentient creature. The attacker must declare the use of this ability prior to rolling to strike.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Silver Cord: This nearly invisible silver chain allows the weapon or its ammunition to be treated as a silver weapon for the purposes of overcoming an outsider or shape changer’s damage reduction. It is often decorated with silver protective charms or moon symbols.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Sun Cord: This relatively thick golden chain is often decorated sunburst, triangle and zig zag designs. Any weapon wrapped with this cord receives a +2 enchantment bonus on attack rolls made against mindless undead.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">White Ribbon: This white cotton strip is painted with blessings in black kanji. A weapon wrapped with this ribbon, or its ammunition, can affect incorporeal or ethereal outsiders and undead normally.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oni-bane Ribbons (any variety)</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Body Slot:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Usually none; attached to a weapon. Can be wrapped around the hands or feet in the gloves or boots slot to enhance unarmed strikes made against demons.</p>
