<p class="pagecaption">Oni-Bane Memento</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For most mortals there is no defense against demonic evil; humans unfortunate enough to live in Black Tokyo are prey to demonic hungers and lusts. Oni-Bane Mementos are tiny charms, sacred and highly personal relics that offer some measure of supernatural protection against demonic evil.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Charms can take any number of forms, from jade or silver religious rituals to a scrap of cloth perfumed with a lover’s scent, to a stylish cell phone charm made of high impact plastic and glass. No matter their appearance, these tiny little charms offer a potent defense.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The wearer of an Oni-Bane Memento receives a +2 enchantment bonus on all saving throws made to resist any outsider’s innate abilities or hostile spells. The wearer is considered to have the Tantric Wisdom feat, purely for the purpose of determining what supernatural effects, such as Black Fatherhood, can affect her.  The charm must be worn by or be within a few inches of the wearer (such as attached to a cell phone carried in a purse, for example) for the wearer to gain the protection.</p>
