<p class="pagecaption">Folding Temple</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Folding Temple is a storied relic of an earlier age, a mystical artifact that was old before the first emperor rose to power. Some legends credit Ameretsu herself with the Folding Temple’s creation - according to those stories, the Folding Temple was the first Japanese Imperial Palace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Realms of the Hut</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This was an experiment by <a href="../npcs/shandi.htm">Shandi</a> and <a href="../npcs/tyana.htm">Tyana</a> in duplicating the effects of the Hut. Even though it failed to meet their desires, it was interesting enough that <a href="../npcs/irena_k.htm">Irena</a> placed it in the <a href="../info/mega_ascend.htm">Mega-Corp Ascendency Realm</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Folding Temple, in its dormant state, is a magnificent origami scale model of a pre-Shinto temple. The sprawling temple complex encompasses a dozen well constructed buildings, all pinnacles of Japanese architecture. The model’s dozen miniature pagodas and torrii gates are constructed from intricately folded and exactingly painted paper. Though barely larger than a newborn child, the miniature temple is exactingly detailed, and its scale model doors actually open, revealing strange temples dedicated to the Goddess of the Rising Sun, which follow no recognized religious tradition known to history.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once per month, it is possible to unlock the Folding Temple’s magic, by placing an offering of rice and sake before the small temple’s doors and performing a short 10 minute ritual. The Folding Temple than blossoms, erupting into reality. The Temple appears around the supplicant, projecting the supplicant and all those within 100 ft of the scale model temple into a non dimensional space where the Folding Temple is a real place.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A wooden torrii gate marks the dimensional boundary where the scale model temple once stood. The supplicant can choose to grant or refuse entry to any one he chooses. No force can breach the pocket dimension without the supplicant’s consent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This pocket dimension is more than 2 miles in diameter, and contains a dozen structures, each with their own meditation rooms, bedchambers, well stocked (if modest) kitchens and communal dining rooms, as well as dojos and temples. The pocket dimension resembles something out of Japan’s mythic, feudal past. It is always a warm, pleasant and quiet night within the pocket dimension.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Folding Temple is a place of quiet and healing. All creatures resting within the pocket dimension receive Fast Healing 1 for as long as they take no action other than resting or light activity. Each hour, a poisoned or diseased creature resting within the Folding Temple receives a new FORT save, with a +4 enchantment bonus to overcome his or her affliction. Conjuration (healing) spells cast within the Folding Temple’s confines have their effects maximized.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For 24 hours after leaving the Folding Temple, all creatures who rested within the Temple gain the ability to naturally see invisible creatures and can naturally detect magical auras, as if they’ve had both these spells cast upon them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Folding Temple can open, revealing the pocket dimension for one day out of each month. Once 24 hours have elapsed, the pocket dimension
vanishes, and all those within the Folding Temple appear around the scale model.</p>
