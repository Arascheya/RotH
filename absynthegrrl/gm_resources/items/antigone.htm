<p class="regtxt5">The Antigone is an airship on the planet Hexiaz. It is the primary vessel of the protagonists in the Hexiaz stories. It is operated by the conventional magic of the world, although, it has a non-standard lens system that will allow modes of travel not normally possible for a ship of its type.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Antigone requires a minimum crew of eight, although ten is better. The ship has most of its space dedicated to cargo. This leaves the crew facilities pushed in wherever they will fit. Quarters are spartan and small.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The current crew is all female, except for the first mate. This is deliberate on the part of the captain. She was given a chance by someone and uses this to repay that favor.</p>

                She is spiritual, in her own way. She believes the life forms of Hexiaz are connected in a web of thought and energy that creates a 'god' that lives in the clouds. She is happiest when the ship is out in the clouds, away from the chaos and noise of the Hexiazi.</br>
