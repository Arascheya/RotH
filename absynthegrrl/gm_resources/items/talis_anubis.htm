<p class="pagecaption">Angelique's Necklace</p>
<p class="regtxt5">also known as: Necklace of the Mother, Probe Controller</p>
<p class="regtxt5">see image</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Value 1000 stars - 10000 for Shifters - 50000 for <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Age 3 Dynasty, Egypt - 2686-2613 BCE</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Intelligence 16</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ego 18</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Alignment Neutral</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This item confers additional strength, speed, and agility to <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a>. Healing is increased to 2 points per hour if the <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a> is rested and well-fed, one point per hour if they are weak or hungry. It also allows them to mimic the appearance of any being within 20% of their starting size and shape. It can gather the surface thoughts and basic personality of the being the <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a> is feeding on if desired. It then stores this basic information as well as the physical appearance allowing the wearer to switch to the stored person as desired. The necklace will store up to its number of gems in profiles. Currently the necklace contains 42 gems with 38 of them filled. Once this limit is reached the gems must be cleared before it can start again. The method of clearing is no longer known.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The item will also store energy from the <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a>'s last meal to allow for a more rational approach to feeding. This gives a <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a> a chance to develop even more strategy and control by reducing the need to feed. It can be used to enter a form of stasis if desired. This stasis can last up to 100 years for each gem with a personality profile stored.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When worn it will be absorbed into the being of the <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a> and remain visible only as a very detailed tattoo. It is removable with a power of the wearer vs. ego of the item or at the death of the <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This item will function only as a normal nacklace for any non-<a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a> wearing it unless the person is already a Shifter of some form. For non-<a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a> Shifters this necklace will give them the ability to store Shift patterns allowing the Shifter to more rapidly assume the shape of a previously mimicked target. When worn by a living being it will not absorb into the skin but will remain a regular necklace.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">DM Notes: The necklace automatically clears itself at the destruction of the wearer. The central gem stores snapshots of the wearer so the wearer can return to their base personality as desired. It also holds echo memories of previous owners so the current wearer has access to the things previous wearers may have learned.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For Mereret/Angelique this also translates into memories of where her Mother came from. She is curious to return there and this drives her to look for the Doors.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It is one of the few items that will always survive a <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a> turning to dust. This item is treated as a Major Artifact and requires its own special method of destruction.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The item can also be cleared by removing it, exposing it to sunlight for at least 8 hours, then putting it back on. The Pwr vs Pwr is required for removal. It will also clear each gem in a last in first out order during hibernation/stasis times. One gem cleared for each 100 years of stasis.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This item came to ancient Egypt through a temporary world gate. <a href="../npcs/imhotep.htm">Imhotep</a> and <a href="../npcs/mereret.htm">Mereret</a> killed the <a href="../char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a> wizard wearing it almost immediately.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The necklace is linked to <a href="../npcs/shandi.htm">Shandi</a>'s <a href="shandi_anklet.htm">Anklet</a>. The two items can locate one another at the request of their owners.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This amulet was designed as a data recovery device - it would send it's own flavor of nanites into the target and extract data from the vampyrites and the host brain. It functions best when used with the vampyrites in the blood of the user. It was the second stage of the experiment and much more successful. If it's nanites are employed by themselves the data recovered is much cleaner and closer to reality since the target isn't radically changed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">These nanites can be injected directly by bite of the necklace wearer. They require several hours to accurately scan the target being. Preliminary data is available within seconds, however it is sketchy and vague at best, totally inaccurate at worst. Once the target has been completely scanned the necklace wearer has access to their memories and physical data. This is stored in one of the storage crystals in the necklace. This data can be used as a personality "overlay" and as the basis for the physical mimicry the necklace supports. Angelique has perfected the use of this over the centuries she has lived.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This item is formed of the stabilized nanites when found by itself. Once it is placed on a host the nanites will disband and flow into the host. There they will begin their sustaining routines and prepare themselves for their data gathering tasks. They are designed to enhance the effects of the vampyrites which is what conveys the added benefits mentioned above.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To destroy this item it must be eaten by nanite reducers of the appropriate type. Currently the only source is on the dead world where Mereret's sire originally contracted the vampyrites. These reducers can also destroy vampyrites, allowing a form of "cure" if the target vampyr is young enough for life support to function without the vampyrites in their system.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">consider mods to the necklace - there are three tiers of gems plus the ones on the wings and the central one. would it make sense to have this mean something other than just the patterns of the item itself?</p>
