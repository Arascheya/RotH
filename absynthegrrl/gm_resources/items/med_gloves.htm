<p class="pagecaption">Medicine Gloves</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Medicine Gloves are thin black leather gloves whose palms are stitched with the flesh of the rarest creature under the heavens: a repentant oni. The demon flesh panels are warm to the touch, and pulse slowly, in rhythm of their donor’s heart beat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By slipping on the gloves, a surgeon can slide his fingers through flesh and bone as easily as he can through water. By passing his fingers through a patient’s skin and into their bodies seamlessly, the surgeon gains a +15 enchantment bonus on Treat Injury checks. The surgeon’s patients are not fatigued after undergoing surgery.</p>
