<p class="pagecaption">Tatami of Peace</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A Tatami of Peace is a woven fiber mat five ft square, and looks virtually indistinguishable from the mundane tatami mats that cover the floors of most Japanese homes. Occasionally, a spark of cobalt lightning can be seen arcing between the fibers, providing a clue to its mystic nature. Shinto blessings are woven on the underside of the fiber, and as the item is created, it is anointed with oil and a few drops of priest or priestess’ blood.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When any religious figurine, icon or holy book is placed on the mat (a full round action), the tatami begins pulsing with a calm, holy energy, filling the room it is placed in with dim radiance, similar to flickering candlelight. For eight hours, or until the religious artifact is moved, the Tatami of Peace sheds its holy light over the area. The Tatami may only be called upon once per day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">No evil outsider or undead creature can approach closer than 60 ft to the Tatami, and their attacks, both mundane and magical end as soon as they touch this invisible barrier. Those inside the radius of the Tatami’s glow receive the effect of a break enchantment spell and a zone of truth spell, both cast by a 9th level acolyte.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In addition, noise from the outside world is filtered out; no sound can penetrate the mystic barrier, though those within the warded area can still hear and converse normally among themselves. Those within the warded area heal at double the normal rate.</p>
