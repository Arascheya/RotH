<p class="pagecaption">Milk Shard</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A milk shard is a glistening, perfect jewel filled with a few drops of divine milk and blood. Milk shards are often a product of Flow Witchery, and are one of the ultimate expressions of biology based magic. Created by a female arcanist through an act of bodily sacrifice, these tiny magical baubles reflect their creator’s personality. The gem’s color and texture is determined by their creator’s subconscious desires and personality, and typically doesn’t vary among a Flow Witch’s milk shards.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Milk Shards are placed against naked skin, and burrow beneath the flesh. Once under the skin, the gem shatters, releasing a rush of mystical fluid into the recipient’s blood. The recipient is imbued with a sense of well being, purpose and health; the mystical milk is visible beneath the skin as it burns pleasurably though the recipient’s veins like white neon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The recipient receives a +2 Deflection bonus to Defense, as well as a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws against fear effects. These bonuses remain in effect for three minutes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During this time, the Milk Shard’s creator wields an incredible influence over the magic’s recipient. The recipient suffers a -2 penalty on all WILL saves made against the Milk Shard’s creator. As a full round action, the Milk Shard’s creator can concentrate and experience the world through the recipient’s senses, provided she is within 1 mile. The Milk Shard’s creator instinctively knows if her magic is ever used, and by whom, provided she is within a mile of the Shard’s use.</p>
