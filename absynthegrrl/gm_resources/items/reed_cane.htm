<p class="regtxt5">Collapsing Reed Cane</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Collapsing Reed Cane is an ancient Buddhist weapon, a reminder of the impermance of mortal life and possessions, a combat parable that has seen good use in battling Black Tokyo’s demonic hordes. The Collapsing Reed Cane is a simple, well balanced and sturdy cane formed from a length of old yellow bamboo. The unassuming cane’s handle is wrapped in dingy red cloth or soft, old leather.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Collapsing Reed Cane, despite its humble nature, makes a formidable melee weapon. The Cane can be used as a simple club, which inflicts 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and threatens a critical hit on a roll of natural 20. The Collapsing Reed cane receives a +2 enchantment bonus on attack rolls and damage, but only in the hands of a wielder with at least 4 ranks in Knowledge: theology & philosophy; it is a mundane club in another’s hands.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">More importantly, when used to strike an object , the Collapsing Reed Cane can ignore some or all of the object’s Damage Resistance or Hardness. Each day, the Cane’s user can ignore a number of points of Hardness/DR equal to his or her ranks in Knowledge: theology & philosophy. The wielder can determine how many points of Hardness/DR (if any) to ignore after rolling damage.</p>
