<p class="pagecaption">Deep Pulse Armor</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Deep Pulse Armor is forged in the depths of the demon’s realm, constructed by demonic smiths and armorers using technology that even the most advanced human science can’t begin to understand. Deep Pulse Seeds are worth a small fortune, a prize coveted beyond all other military secrets. In their inactive state, Deep Pulse Seeds resemble long, tapering cylinders, warm to the touch. These organic, slick shafts are the color of dried blood and old bruises, and secrete a thick, vicious fluid with the coppery odor of old blood, which tingles like electric shocks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A woman can slide the Deep Pulse Seed into her body, masturbating quickly to orgasm. As her climax approaches, the Pulse Seed comes to life, sending feeder tendrils deep into her body, and spreading its purple and black stain over her nude skin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Within moments of activation the armored carapace hardens, becoming a sleek second skin of black and purple polymer, marked with dozens of blinking eye spots. The Pulse Armor covers every inch of the woman’s body, covering her face in a slick, shell like helmet, which covers the woman up to the mask’s vicious, insectoid mandibles. Somehow, the woman within can see though the featureless face mask.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Deep Pulse Armor is a demonic symbiote which feeds on the host in exchange for raw physical power. Each day the Deep Pulse Armor is worn, the host suffers 1d3 points of temporary CON drain, as well as one point of temporary WIS drain, making the suit impractical and dangerous for long wear. While wearing the suit, the host requires at least twice as much food and water as any other humanoid of equivalent size.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Donning the Deep Pulse Armor requires at least 10 minutes. Removing a Pulse Armor requires an act of will, and a full round action. The host is nauseated for 1d3 hours after removing the Armor seed. The Deep Pulse Armor returns to its dormant phallic state when not in use, waiting for another chance to serve.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While wearing the Deep Pulse Armor, the host receives a +4 enhancement bonus to DEX, a +2 enhancement bonus to STR, and a +6 natural armor bonus to defense. The Deep Pulse Armor grants its host darkvision and the tremorsense 60 ft special quality.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Deep Pulse Armor possesses a natural bite attack, which deals 1d4 points of piercing damage, and threatens a critical hit on a natural 19-20 as a secondary attack. The Armor’s talons inflict 1d8 points of slashing damage, and threaten a critical hit on a natural 20.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While wearing the Deep Pulse Armor, the host has access to the following Hentai feats, even if he does not normally meet the prerequisites:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Barbaric Rage</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Cleave</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Elusive Target</p>

<p class="regtxt9"><a href="file:///z:/shapes/BlackTokyo/vag_prison.htm">Vaginal Prison</a> or Womanly Suffocation</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The gamemaster may decide that a specially constructed, unique Deep Pulse Armor seed might grant the wearer access to any three - four other appropriate feats. Increase the unique Deep Pulse Armor seed’s Purchase DC by +2, possibly more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Deep Pulse Armor (can only be worn by females)</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Body Slot:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Symbiotic Armor (occupies the armor body slot)</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Construction:</p>
