<p class="pagecaption">Beauty Knives</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Imagine a blade that cuts as sharply as a beautiful woman’s rejection. Imagine a blade that only becomes more ornately decorated with each drop of blood it spills. Now imagine ?ve of those blades on each hand, hiding in plain sight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Beauty Knives are a set of magical ceramic nail extensions, as ornately and expensively decorated as anything you’ll ever find in a Rappongi club. A mental command transforms the long artificial nails into deadly weapons. Each time the Beauty Knives are used to commit murder, their decoration changes slightly, but is always highly fashionable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When transformed into mystic knives, the Beauty Knives inflict 1d4 points of slashing damage on a successful hit. These mystic knives cannot be sundered or disarmed, and the wearer is always considered pro?cient in their use. Beauty Knives have a critical threat range of 19-20 and inflict double (2x) damage on a critical hit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Unlike conventional knives, the wearer uses his or her CHA modifier as a bonus on attack rolls and damage with the Beauty Knives. Extending or retracting the Beauty Knives is a free action.</p>
