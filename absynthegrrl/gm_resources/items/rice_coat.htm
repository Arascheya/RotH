<p class="pagecaption">Blessed Rice Coat</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the old stories, weak willed demons can be held at bay by a grain of rice blessed by a Buddha. Other stories tell of oni who are confused and tricked thanks to a clever human scattering grains of rice for them to count obsessively. The Blessed Rice Coat transforms an old legend into a new defense against Black Tokyo’s other dimensional predators.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Blessed Rice Coat is a designer leather trench coat, cut in an ultra slick, modern style. The trench coat’s silk inner lining is a silk-screened reproduction of a Hirosaki print of famers reaping the harvest and sewn between the leather and the lining are hundreds of blessed grains of rice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To a human, the Coat is nothing more than an attractive, expensive designer fashion piece. But when the wearer throws open the cloak in the presence of any outsider (a standard action), the farmers in the print come to life. The silk-screened farmers thresh their rice, collecting the harvest, and the golden light of sunset emanates from the coat’s lining.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Any outsider within 60 ft of the cloak when it is thrown open, assuming they can clearly see the wearer and the magically active lining, must succeed at a DC 22 WILL save or become cowering for 2d4 rounds. While cowering, the creature is frozen in fear, loses its DEX bonus, and can take no action. The cowering demon takes a -2 penalty to defense for the duration. An outsider who successfully saves against the coat’s magic is dazed for a single round.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The wearer can open the magical coat once per day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The heavy leather duster is considered to be a leather jacket, providing a +1 equipment bonus to Defense, no armor check penalty and has a +8 maximum Defense Bonus. While wearing the Blessed Rice Coat, the wearer receives a +4 equipment bonus to Defense against melee attacks made by outsiders.</p>
