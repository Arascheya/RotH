<p class="pagecaption">Hut Gem</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is a star amathyst about 2 inches long by 1 inch wide, by 1/2 inch thick shaped in an intricate multi-faceted pattern. When exposed to sinlight or magical light they will allow the Hut to jump to their location. At the time of arrival the location is automatically entered into the Hut Nav-Sys.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Implementation: this is the easiest way for a Player Hut to add Nav-Sys coords to its database. At the time plaers are assigned to a Hut an equal number of these will become available. (one to a player) If another player is added by the controller for a particular Hut then another one will appear either in the stash or in the possession of the new player. This depends on whether or not the stash has been found at the time of the addition.</p>
