<p class="regtxt5">2 Tomahas 6700 - Felix Shelmak delivered the item to us today. It had been found in the Great Wastes, near the ruined city of Glangalath. Tamaris demands we drop all other research and focus on this one exclusively.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">22 Tomahas 6700 - It is a power amplifier, drawing on something unknown to function. Every spell we have sent through it emerges magnified over 100 fold.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">25 Tomahas 6700 - Dorotea has left to research this item at the great libraries of Formanought.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">27 Derethnish 6700 - Dorotea was only supposed to be gone a month. She still has not returned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">2 Cenetash 6700 - The artifact has been mounted in a magical projector as Tamaris commanded. All that remains is testing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">3 Cenetash 6700 - No time for tests, the war has come to us. Tamaris has moved the projector to her tower and ordered us to prepare potions and items for healing and battle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">5 Cenetash 6700 - I hope Dorotea is safe in Formnought and not on the road to be caught by the troupes surrounding the city. Tamaris is charging the projector for use in a few hours.</p>
