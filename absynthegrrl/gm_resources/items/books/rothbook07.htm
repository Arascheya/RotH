<p class="pagecaption">Lucy's Memoirs</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We were young and full of confidence that day so long ago when we set out. We had grown up on the tales of adventure as spun by the bards in my mother's inn. Everywhere seems so much more perfect than here in Stratmore-Upon-Comcrash.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Darina was the daughter of Gustavos Snowden, the Butcher. Roweana and Anya were the only survivors of their family. They had lived in an out-lying farm that had been destroyed by orcs. I was the daughter of Lorin Wendt and Helga Tomara. Anya was the same age as Darina and I while Roweana was two years older. Our childhood was the usual, running around, getting under foot, and pestering the other children. Before we became young adults, Peteran Flavius was a member of our little band as well. We practiced to be adventurers, creating adventures in barns and the edges of the forest, slaying beasts, rescuing people, and amassing great treasures.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the changes to young adult started, Peteran became more serious and timid. Anya and I changed, but not all that much. Darina, well Darina became a caged thing. She roamed farther and farther from the village. Often dragging us along.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The love between us started as good friendship, but grew to more as the changes in us drove us to seek physical and emotional ties with others. The boys around here were too staid and traditional to really interest us, so we bonded together. We thought there was nothing we couldn't face as a group.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When we approached eighteen summers a band of adventurers came to my mother's inn. They were a cut above the usual with well worn but expensive gear and a calm confidence that few other groups had. They told tales in the inn that night of great battles, terrible evils, and the need to stand together against the Dark Forces that sought dominion of our world. They were recruiting troops for the Hell Gate Wars, as the battles became known. We signed on immediately. Darina had to sneak away. Anya and I were given grudging permission to join up. Roweana wasn't going to go first, but when she found out Anya was going, she signed up to help protect her sister.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At first it was what we expected, camping in the forest and along the roads to the muster point. Weapons training to get us ready. We were part of the large army heading to the High Valley and the Gate there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were taken through part of the Ancients Way, a long smooth, large tunnel carved into the very rock itself. To get to the High Valley we had to leave the Ancients Way and make our way through a section of the Dwarven First Holm. Here we saw what adventuring was really about. It was cold, dark, and damp. Sniper attacks started almost as soon as we entered the caverns. We couldn't see to easily fight back. Our magic using people were kept busy healing and providing light.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We lost one in eight to the skirmishes and the random attacks. The stink of blood and the screams. Oh goddess, the screams were the worst. Roweana coped by growing slightly more distant, a fore-shadowing of what she is like now. Anya became a bit paranoid and I grew more cautious. Darina began taking greater and greater risks, slipping through the shadows and attacking any enemy she found.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The heroic tales the bards tell are mostly about the Heroes of the Gates, the brave strike teams that went in to actually seal the Gates. Those of us in the front lines saw a different story. We were the distraction, the shock troops to keep the Dark Forces occupied so the "Heroes" could do their work. The battles were meat grinders. I rose rapidly through the ranks to commander. Partly because I was a good leader and partly because I remained alive when those above me died. Anya was my lieutenant. Roweana was always in my group as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Darina began to disappear for days at a time. When she would come back it was often injured and covered in blood. When I reached the rank of commander I found out she was a surgical strike assassin. She was slipping into enemy encampments and killing specific targets.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The last battle shouldn't even be called such. We lost nine of every ten of us. Anya fell taking an arrow meant for me and Roweana has never really forgiven me. Darina returned after having been badly maimed to find Anya dead. Darina and I stayed together, trying to use each other to blunt the pain of our loses, but all we did was remind each other.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several weeks after the last battles we found out that the "Heroes" hadn't even intended to win the war. So many lives lost in a holding action with no resolution ever intended. I think that's when Darina finally snapped. She disappeared one night and I never saw her again. For a while there were rumors of her, then, there was nothing. I imagine she fell somewhere and no one survived to tell the tale of it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I fell into drinking and sleeping with anyone that had a desire. Ahkmed found me dead drunk, naked, and bleeding from a rough round of sex in an alley. It took him months to convince me I wanted to keep living, but slowly he brought me back from the edge. We returned to Stratmore-Upon-Comcrash six years after I left seeking adventure. The sameness and stagnation that I had found so oppressive when I left now gave me great comfort. My daughters and Ahkmed have kept me from sliding back into that despair again.</p>
