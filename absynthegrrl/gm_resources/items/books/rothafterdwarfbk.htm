<p class="regtxt5">This weighty tome is written in neat Dwarvish script. There are several loose pages of velum in the front containing the following text:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Most of us are dead and King Glorin will likely not last this day. Tamaris attacked, claiming we hadn't paid enough for protection. The war on the surface has driven her mad and she is a human completely out of control.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">King Glamon had called upon the Fleshfeaster in time of need and had been granted a Gem of Calling. It is a desperate risk, the Fleshfeaster can be far more deadly than Tamaris, yet we are desperate. If she comes I will beg her to take my people to a safe land. Maybe there is enough left in the treasury to cover her price.</p>
