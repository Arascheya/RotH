<p class="pagecaption">Handbook of Gate Theory</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At first I was going to place all the information in this one volume. Then I realized it would be easier in several. Ask Koria, the librarian, and she will get the various volumes for you. She has a rule that no books may leave the Hut and she is quite strict on enforcing this, particularly with the sensitive inter-planar items like my notes.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Tesch Mar Thesis Brief</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Gates</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are two forms of gates on the average world. These are the "Natural" gate and the "Hell" gate. Both come into being where the boundary between "Real Space" (an Ancient term for the Prime Material Plane) and the "Gate Dimension" are thin. Through my researches I intend to determine the usual number and placement strategy of these gates. I also plan to prove the connection between Hell gates and Natural gates. I believe the two are connected phenomenon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Further I hope to prove these gates are actually linked to local magical nodes (called Earth Nodes in some papers) in some way. I plan to prove these gate nodes are actually super nodes in the earth node network. As such mathematical analysis indicates there should be seven super nodes for each local network in the Prime Material Plan. (mathematical modeling based on the Tesch Mar Hypothesis of Unified Universal Magic)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Natural gates may be used to travel between places in the Prime Material Plane. All that is required is the appropriate magic spells. These gates may be stabilized with powerful spells and held in one place, otherwise they tend to open, close, and drift randomly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hell gates open, close and drift similar to Natural gates but their stabilization requires sacrifices of sentient beings at each gate location. There are other implications but as the subject is disgusting to me I shall leave it to others to make these determinations.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Kaltereth</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">A Corollary to Tesch Mar's Thesis on Gates</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Many years later Kaltereth devised a more complete theory using ideas proposed in (need another majik tome name). Kaltereth proposed that the nodes weren't connected in a random manner as Tesch Mar's papers indicate, but rather were arranged in tree structures. Each tree would have a base node that tied to other base nodes in a ring/star type of topography. Her conclusions up to the point of her disappearance stated there were seven base or super nodes from which the tree structures originate. She postulated even more intense effects on magic at these super nodes. She based these conclusions on careful measurements of magic travel times compared with actual map distances for several nodes she found. She found travel times tended to imply the path between nodes was not always the straightest of lines. Up until her disappearance she was trying to devise a way to identify and travel to one of these super nodes. She also believed these nodes were in actuality the fabled World Gates, mentioned in non-human legends as their points of origin in this world.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Actual Design</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On worlds where the boundaries between "Real Space" and the "Gate Dimension" are thin any sort of intense energy burst can bring a gate into being. These gates form because of a tear in the boundary between dimensions. Harmonics from these pulses can open gates into many different dimension sets. This is one way Hell Gates can come into being at the same time. World Gates can be created with carefully contained magic or technology and thus not cause harmonic gates to form.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a more sinister way to create hell gates. This requires the willing sacrifice of a powerful Arcane. Six other sacrifices are also required. First a gate framework is created. Next a special crystal is placed in the horns of the Soul Eater and it is used in the preparation rituals. During these rituals the other six are sacrificed one at a time and their energies forced into the crystal through the use of the Soul Eater. Once these sacrifices have been made the crystal is removed from the blade and attuned by the target Arcane. The crystal is then implanted in the forehead of the Arcane sacrifice and he is bound to it through a ritualistic death. The six original sacrifices contribute Power, Con, and Intelligence to the resulting creature. During the rituals the essences of the sacrifices cook down into the crystal and bones of the Arcane. These bones are then placed into a gate framework and another series of rituals are performed to create the Hell Gate. A final set of rituals bind the gate, creature, and gate framework into one. The spirit of the creature becomes the gate controller. Another part of it splits off and becomes a wraith-like being that guards the gate and controller.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bones of the Arcane are placed into the gate framework with the skull placed behind the key stone. The other bones are used to frame the opening.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hand has found additional magics that allow him to create binding and controlling spells when the gate is being created. This places the guardian under his control and allows him to use it as one of his minions. If the physical form of this creature is killed it will reform at its gate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To seal a Hell Gate requires a power vs power against the guardian/controller and several spells to create the actual seal itself. These include spells to place the guardian into a form of stasis so it cannot awaken and cast spells to remove the seal. A mythryl spike is also required. This is hollowed out and the void filled with anti-magic serum and driven into the skull behind the key stone of the gate. This also helps to keep the guardian from performing any magic to break the seal. A sealed Hell Gate cannot be re-opened somewhere else. It must first be closed and then re-opened with another series of sacrifices and rituals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Closing a Hell Gate is even more difficult. This requires the Gate Keeper spirit to be dispelled and then all the magics bound into the gate and framework to be unwoven. There are spells available from several groups that allow the sharing/combining of power to allow enough for a chance at the power vs power required to seal or close a gate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is another way to close a Hell Gate. This requires the use of Soul Eater. The Gate must first be prepared as if for Sealing. Once the myhtryl spike has been driven home the Gate frame must be carefully taken down. Care must be taken to insure the spike remains in contact with the skull in the key stone at all times. After the skeleton is exposed then Soul Eater must be touched to the binding crystal and a Ritual of Release incanted. Soul Eater will then suck the soul from the binding crystal and consume it in the normal way. If this is done with a new binding crystal in place the Gate Keeper's attributes are available to power the greater Dark Spells.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Gate Locations</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Hell Gates</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I don't recommend attempting to use the Hell Gate networks. The hostility of the others you meet is often quite high.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Primary Gate is the first one listed, usually labelled 1. A Primary Gate is the first one to come into existance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The danger with hell gates is if all of them are closed they can be relocated and reopened using additional opening rituals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">need to tie the hell gates to the demon web concept - a variant of the world gate concept - all Hell Gates go to the demonic section of the outer planes</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">World Gates</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are various supplicants in the Hut Hallway. Each of them has a problem they desire the Hut to fix for them. After you talk to them their Gate destinations will appear in the jump controller in the Control Room. You may then jump to their Realms if desired.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Primary Gate is the first one listed, usually labelled 1. A Primary Gate is the first one to come into existance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The World Gates on Zeltrop, the origin world of the Hut, are technologically sealed with control being maintained by the main computer system at the Gardens. In this Realm other means of travel must often be found. There is an Egg-Car system, a series of tunnels with Eggs that move rapidly through them.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Gates - Misc. Notes</p>

<p class="regtxt5">World Gates and Hyperdrives create the equivalent of vapor trails across the ethereal - these are echoes of the transdimensional aspects of these travel mechanisms.</p>
