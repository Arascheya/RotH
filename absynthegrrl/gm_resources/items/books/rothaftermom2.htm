<p class="regtxt5">Maybe Mishana has told you this already, however, if she hasn't...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My sister, Dorotea, is still alive as I write this. She has become one of the Wizard Lords. I don't know what to think about this. The Wizard Lords are repressive, controlling, and brutal as a general rule. Dorotea started life as a warm, friendly, and caring woman. No telling what happened during her climb to power.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If you are here, it very likely means a Wizard Lord has returned. I have left two links active from these private chambers to other locations. One is from the sitting room to an office I had at the Research Center. You will find various research notes in my desk there. The second link is in the side chamber off the sitting room and it leads to a strange device Dorotea and I found. Inside this device is all the information you will need to  find and destroy the artifact of power hidden in the vault below the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The artifact of power would be very dangerous in the hands of the Wizard Lords. Please, get it from the Vault and bring it to the Testing Chamber in this lab. Place it in the center and destroy it, using the controllers around the ring. The destruction sequence is locked in the Vault with the artifact. This artifact was responsible for the destruction of my city. Do not let it fall into the hands of anyone seeking power.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are some notes about the artifact in the bookshelf to the left of the desk as well.</p>
