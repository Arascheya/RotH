<p class="regtxt5">The King in Yellow awaits the arrival of those from beyond time. With them come the seven Star Gems, items of great power containing the power of the stars themselves. From these travellers shall you obtain these items of power. Prepare the symbol of opening as scribed herewthin. Sacrifice a virgin of greatest purity upon the Symbol with the Star Gems in place. Drive the cold iron spikes through hands, feet, head and heart at the time of the alignments fortold.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The highest of you shall give as well. the ;ast two cold iron spikes shall be driven through his hands and the blood of faith shall mix with the purest to break the Seal and draw the King. Then shall be recited the text of freeing. Into the world shall come the King once more, returned from exile beyond the stars. The earth shall tremble at His coming and only the Chosen shall sit at His side.</p>
