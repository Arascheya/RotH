<p class="pagecaption">Hut Notes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At first I was going to place all the information in this one volume. Then I realized it would be easier in several. Ask Koria, the librarian, and she will get the various volumes for you. She has a rule that no books may leave the Hut and she is quite strict on enforcing this, particularly with the sensitive inter-planar items like my notes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hut is a combination of majik and technology. Technological power is provided by a matter-antimatter tapping and reaction system. Majikal power is derived from it using a thought crystal control and conversion matrix. This crystal matrix is the key to using majik and technology as an integrated system. These systems as well as general purpose power and maintenance items are in the Core Systems chamber.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There will be several main class types in this construct - one will be based on the fundamentals of 'real space' matter, this will be the absolute base class, ZeroRM, and will provide the inheritance for all other classes. Derived from it will be StaticRM, TransRM. StaticRM will be alterable by me and only me, TransRM will be modifiable by anyone who shares this place with me. Further derivation will yield StaticObj and TransObj. StaticObj will be to objects as StaticRM but for objects and items that I might wish to have around me. TransObj will provide the same function as TransRM. AttachObj, LinkEntity, and AttachEntity will allow 'real space' objects and beings to be linked into the construct so they can be moved with it. All of this will be done in majik and tech, kind of a true 'multi-platform' approach.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Room objects may contain several room objects allowing a suite of rooms to be considered a single instance object in the hut operating environment. A classic example is the library StaticRM object which is composed of several StaticRM objects.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">LinkEntity - 1 Instance - me</p>

<p class="regtxt5">AttachEntity - Instances vary with number of guests</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It works. I just don't think I'll ever try to relink anything at the ZeroRM level - the first, and only, time I tried it, it hurt so much I wasn't sure I could even get through the start-up procedures. So far I have been able to visit anywhere and not have troubles. The construct is powered by both majik and techno and seems able to function in areas where one or both types of energy exist.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This device, this Hut, moves through time and space. The Hut Interface, the Door to the Realm you are currently in, connects to the Throne Room. The Master Key will give you access to all Hut functions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Use this construct wisely. You are now the Mistress of the Hut, the Balance Maintainer. To you falls the task of maintaining the Balance between extremes in the Multi-verse. This is the balance between good and evil, light and dark, law and chaos. Use whatever means you will, but the balance is critical.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Should you require advice or assistance, seek the She Who Must Never be Named. She... resides in Centrys, the City at the Center of Everything. It is a trans-planar city where Doors lead to all Realms, Dimensions, and locations. There is a Door in the Hallway that leads to She...'s chambers.</p>
