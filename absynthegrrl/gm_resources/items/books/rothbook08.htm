<p class="pagecaption">Hell Gate Wars</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Dark Forces rose to power on many worlds in the multi-verse. Their main goal was the creation and opening of seven Hell Gates on each world where they had achieved significant numbers. This would allow the Princes of the Hells access to the Real Space Realms and a way for the Dark Forces to travel easily between these various worlds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Across the multi-verse vast armies engaged the Dark Forces on the steps of their various holdings near the open Hell Gates. The entire purpose of these attacks were to distract the main forces while small groups of adventurers infiltrated and attempted to seal the Gates. The strategy mostly worked, but at a terrible cost. One of ten in the main armies survived to make it home. Many of them died not long after. The heroes disappeared into hiding, fearing reprisals from The Hand and other leaders.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The sealing of the final Hell gate one each Real Space Realm requires the use of major artifacts, each an echo of a "master set" lost in the depths of time and dimensions. These echo items were not located before the Hell Gate Wars began. Now the Dark Forces wait in the shadows, biding their time and slowly rebuilding their strength. When they again reach strength, they will try once more to open the Gates and subjugate their various Realms.</p>
