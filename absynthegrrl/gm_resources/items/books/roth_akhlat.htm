They were on a pilgrimage for the legendary plane shifter Margla Fleshfeaster. Kanayugara managed a quick look at the book before Margla saw him and cast him from its presence. Such was her ire that the questers were exiled to the Astral Plane. Only great luck allowed their return to this realm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Akhalt, where the Undying One rules from the Glowing Throne to this very day...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Doomed, cursed Akhalt, which the very gods spurned, transforming all the realm around it into a burning waste...</p>
