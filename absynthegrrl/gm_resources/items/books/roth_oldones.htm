<p class="pagecaption">The Old Ones</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This term is mistakenly used for older gods of various worlds. In truth, there are only two Old Ones. These are the Creator and the Destructor. They split from the primal force at the dawn of the current universal age. The Creator is the creative force that balances the destructive force of the Destructor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the start of this age the Creator and the Destructor were in balance, each one understanding the importance of the other and of a balance between their effects.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the age progressed each one sought more and more to achieve supremacy in view point. As time went along and various intelligent beings were created and evolved they would attempt to use these for proxy wars.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At last a group of younger gods fought each of these primal powers to a standstill and imprisoned them outside the flow of time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Creator struggles to free itself and create a new group of followers. This time the goal is the destruction of the younger ones and any of their allied creatures. Then it seeks to overwhelm and destroy the Destructor. The Destructor seeks to destroy the Creator and any others that oppose it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The exact whereabouts of the Elder Sign sealed gateways to the Creator and Destructor are not known.</p>
