<p class="pagecaption">The Younger Gods - The Greater Powers</p>
<p class="regtxt5">These were created by the two Elder Gods as servants. They were content in this role until the Elder Gods began to fight both directly and through proxies. These battles began to threaten the very fabric of space and time so the Younger Gods combined their powers and imprisoned the Creator and the Destructor outside the flow of time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Younger Gods exist as a triad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One face is the face of matter, order, and form. She is known as the She Who Must Never Be Named and she controls the city at the center of forever, Centrys, also known as City at the Center, City of Gates, City of She... This is the anchor point for the material forms of the multiverse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The second face is the face of the void, emptiness, unfulfilled potential, and formlessness. She drifts through the dark places of the universe and contemplates the raw forces of energy and entropy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The third face is the Great Mother, the one who balances between form and formlessness. This is the face that creates races, brings change to stagnant systems and order to chaotic systems. As part of her chaos she will periodically incarnate into a member of one of the sentient races and observe from within. She also uses this tactic to bring stability or chaos as required.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These three are considered the Great Powers. From them all others are derived. In their images are the gods and goddesses of the sentient creatures created. Deep within the psyches of all sentients is a tiny kernel that came from these Powers at their creations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Greater Powers exist across all time streams. There is only one of each and they are unkillable by any normal means. There are only two ways to end them:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">1) they can meet together and unmake themselves, returning to the energy pool that is the multiverse.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">2) they will end if the Creator and Destructor ever meet.</p>
