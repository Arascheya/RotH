<p class="pagecaption">Magic Theory</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At first I was going to place all the information in this one volume. Then I realized it would be easier in several. Ask Koria, the librarian, and she will get the various volumes for you. She has a rule that no books may leave the Hut and she is quite strict on enforcing this, particularly with the sensitive inter-planar items like my notes.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Tesch Mar Hypothesis</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Unified Universal Magic</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Magic is the use of naturally occurring energies to achieve a desired result. These energies are universal and well defined. Any form of magic inherently draws upon these energies regardless of the method used for gathering. The gathering methods are just different techniques taught to access the same energies. Some techniques are easier to master and thus are easier to teach and use.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are two primary manifestations of magical effects. The first is "priest/god" magic. This is magic taught as complete spells by the elders of the cult the caster belongs to. The additional energy for the spells is provided from the deity's pool of energy. This energy pool is filled by the members of the cult as part of the holy day energy sacrifices.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The second form is "Arcane" magic. In this treatise it will be referred to as majik to make it easily differentiable from "priest/god" magic.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Arcane majik is taught as theory, principle, and technology. Arcanes learn the basic concepts of how majik can be used to manipulate the forces of the worlds around them. This form of training allows the Arcane to easily create new spells based on underlying principles and concepts. This form is viewed as heresy by the priests of many religions. This form is also the one used by most rogue spell casters for destructive effects.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Both forms of magic function based on the details below. In "priest/god" magic these details are hidden from the caster. Only the highest of the High Priests have even a vague understanding of this. In Arcane majik these concepts are taught at the beginning of each student's curriculum.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Each spell is a pattern of energy control that produces a predictable and desired result. These patterns may be taught or learned by intense study and experimentation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Each spell consists of several distinct sections. The first section is the preparation of the user's awareness and concentration, allowing the user to visualize the energies used to create the desired pattern. The second section is the actual construction of the magical pattern for the spell and draws on the inherent psychic power of the user. The third section is the gathering and binding of external, supplemental energy required by the spell. This step often requires additional energies from the user to control the gathered energy. The final step is the targeting and release of the finished spell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spells are taught as complete patterns to the neophyte, only as the user's skill and abilities grow is the user able to figure out how to change the amount of external energy required to vary the effect of the spell. Subtle changes in the pattern creation will allow changing the range or area of effect of the spell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Magic identification is done by following the patterning of the spell(s) on the item in question. To be adept at this skill the identifier must have had exposure to a broad base of spells and pattern examples.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Items are created by first weaving a binding spell (enchant) into the material parts of the item. Once the item is assembled then the actual effect spell(s) are woven into the hooks left by the enchant base spell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A 12th level spell, Encryption, allows the creator of an item to put a randomized pattern into the overall pattern of the item. This randomizer constantly changes so it is very difficult to unweave the magic on the item. Exhaustive research is required to attempt to dispel magic that has been encrypted this way. Usually this requires access to many spells and items created by the developer of the item to be dispelled. The caster of the encryption can unweave this pattern at any time.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">End of Tesch Mar Hypothesis</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Tesch Mar Thesis Brief</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Gates</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are two forms of gates on the average world. These are the "Natural" gate and the "Hell" gate. Both come into being where the boundary between "Real Space" (an Ancient term for the Prime Material Plane) and the "Gate Dimension" are thin. Through my researches I intend to determine the usual number and placement strategy of these gates. I also plan to prove the connection between Hell gates and Natural gates. I believe the two are connected phenomenon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Further I hope to prove these gates are actually linked to local magical nodes (called Earth Nodes in some papers) in some way. I plan to prove these gate nodes are actually super nodes in the earth node network. As such mathematical analysis indicates there should be seven super nodes for each local network in the Prime Material Plan. (mathematical modeling based on the Tesch Mar Hypothesis of Unified Universal Magic)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Natural gates may be used to travel between places in the Prime Material Plane. All that is required is the appropriate magic spells. These gates may be stabilized with powerful spells and held in one place, otherwise they tend to open, close, and drift randomly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hell gates open, close and drift similar to Natural gates but their stabilization requires sacrifices of sentient beings at each gate location.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">More information is available in the Handbook of Gate Theory.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">End of Tesch Mar Thesis Brief</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I still have not heard from Tesch Mar again. The last message said he had found an ideal place to begin his researches and he was going to build his residence there. Damn, and I so wanted to know his results. He was the most promising of the students at the school in so many years.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Kaltereth addendum</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Minor power nodes link to major nodes and these link to "super" nodes. She performed various tests and found there could only be seven of these "super" nodes. Research at one of these "super" nodes found it to be a World Gate location. Using standard Gate detection methods around a major node revealed glimmers of the nearest Gate energy flowing into the node. Casting a majikal gate spell bounced her through the nearest World Gate location and then to her destination. Interestingly she found some type of techno locking device on the World Gates of her world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Margla's Note: my last communication from her said she was headed off with someone named Aztol. He was going to provide her access to other worlds and gates for additional research. I have heard nothing from her since.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Addendum: Aztol has come to ask me for information. When asked about Kaltereth he said she was lost. He is not a trustworthy person so I wonder what has become of my friend.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Margla's Corollary to Tesch Mar Hypothesis</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Majik and energy are similar things. Majik can be used and controlled like energy. Given suitable devices majik should be able to be interfaced to technological artifacts. Some type of energy resonant device must be the key to this effect.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">End of Margla's Corollary</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It works, I have combined a techno device and a majik spell! So far it is crude but it will work. The hardest part was creating an operating system hook in the small computer of the techno device that could read and interpret the majik energies linked to the thought crystal interface. I wish Kayara was still around, she was an absolute genius with software, particularly operating systems, and could have written a new system to handle all of this. I must acquire more computer equipment, maybe a larger system will work better.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now that old hyperdrive engine has finally come in useful. It's been a real bother having to stay near it to ease the pain. It will form the techno part of the core of a new device, a linking of majik and tech the likes the universe has never seen. Around it will be woven a shell of majik and techno energies, self replicating and sustaining, that will be able to form 'matter' and 'substance'. In it I will be able to roam the universe and still keep that damn anchor near me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The results of these experiments are this Hut that you are now linked to. You may find more information in Hut Notes.</p>
