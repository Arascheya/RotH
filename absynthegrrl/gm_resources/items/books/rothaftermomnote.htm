<p class="regtxt5">If you are reading this, then Mishana has given you my key and the Wizard Lords are here.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have left you my ring which will take you to my rooms and lab. I have left you notes I had hoped you would never need to use. Some are on a bookshelf in my bedroom and others are in my office in the Lab. I hope they are enough.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I love you very much!</p>
