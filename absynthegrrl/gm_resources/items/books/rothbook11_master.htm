<p class="sectioncaption">NWN 1, Campaign Start</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A woman once asked me, "Don't you want to settle down, raise a family, become a part of a community?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All I could think was, "Only in my worst nightmares. To be ground bound, stuck on some gods forsaken rock, would be a hell from which I would run screaming. I embraced the Hut of All Worlds, the Hut of Margla Fleshfeaster. I reveled in the knowledge that I could go anywhere and any when, and never have I regretted the price of admission."</p>

<!-- section 2 - added for start of campaign - make this a living doc - Irena can dynamically update it - when she does, there will be the deep gong of the Hut percievable by the owner of the book only -->

<p class="regtxt5">Tannhauser Gate. I have looked upon it at last. The reports did it no justice, did not capture the strangeness of it, the size of it. When time allows we must return and investigate. Surely there is something left in the massive complexes nearby that may provide clues. If we can't decipher it, likely none can.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I thought science would explain the universe. It still might, but Centrys throws up so many exceptions to the theories I learned as fact so long ago. How can a city sit at the center of a "multi-verse"? How can an infinite place have a center or an edge? How can a "multi-verse" exist? How can a place have attachment points with every other possible place? How can there be a place for every possibility ever imagined, and for those not imagined by any I know, as well?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I would have thought it impossible, yet I have seen it. There is so much to see and so little time. Even if time is infinite, how can it ever be seen, explored, understood?</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">On Riverwind - given to Bill's Character</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When my friend gave me my essence, it didn't seem real. The Repository convinced me. Its beautiful. A gleaming marble and granite temple stands over the stairwell down to the data chambers. It winds down five hundred feet around an open light well and ends on a floor of red granite. Enormous bronze doors stand open to welcome the visitor to the reception hall. Keepers move about their tasks with quiet dignity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They greeted me with warmth and welcome, glad I had finally returned to them. One motioned a snake bodied, six armed woman from a side area where she was working. "Mistress, you should know the great news. Klktzash has been elevated to the Keepers. Her assistance to other researchers during her time here has been of great benefit to all and her depths of understanding of the levels of the Abyss has expanded the demonic data wing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was so happy! I had worried when she had resigned as Hut Librarian that she would end up back in the Abyss.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They conducted me on a complete tour of the repository, my repository as they constantly reminded me. Towering grottos of glowing crystal soared over me. Inside the clear surfaces memories and data pulsed in glowing purple motes and swirls. Researchers from across the multi-verse were wired into strangely shaped interface machines, scanning for esoteric lore. Keepers moved about, providing sustenance, advice, and reminding the researchers to periodically break from their routine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was about to leave when a Keeper hurried up. "Mistress, you should come and see. A Gatherer has returned." She motioned me after her and led the way to a side chamber. Within it a spider-like creature rested on a bed of silk. Two Keepers were carrying it toward an ancient device. Reverently they placed the pillow into a small chamber and swung the door closed. Images flashed and flickered on a large screen, coalescing into a steady stream of memory, recovered from the Gatherer and added to the repository.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the task was finished, the Gatherer was removed from the machine and taken to a place of rest. There it would rest and recover before leaving to once again gather information from around the multi-verse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The part of me that was still me wanted to know how long this place had been. The part of me that was not me, but had been returned to me, knew it was as old as the multi-verse itself. Created by the Balance Keeper to hold everything the multi-verse had discovered about itself. Another reminder of what I had been, and what I had become.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I still wonder what I have become. What has happened to the me that ruled the Human Empire in the time before the Razaks came and wrought havoc upon it.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">- Mysteriously added while you were sleeping at the Hook and Line</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Past</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Angelique has inspired me. The trouble she has remembering all she has been through, reminds me I should keep record of my beginnings before they fade from my mind in the face of everything else.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Return to Icicle</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I returned to Icicle today. My excuse was to pick up some data I had stashed there when I was Premiere, however, the real reason was much more personal. Some of the best years of my life had been spent there and I wanted to see if the changes had altered those memories. I had forgotten the cold beauty of the place and it reminded me of the first time I saw it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I first saw Icicle as the transport ship swung in to dock at Platform One. There was a cold beauty to the white ball floating in the blackness that I hadn't expected. The briefing docs painted a bleak picture of a frozen world inhabited only by the miners forced to work there. Bitter cold, freezing winds, and hard effort to drag out chemicals for use in pharmaceuticals and beauty aids were all it was known for.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was met at the grimy dock by two scruffy men in miner garb. "Neshkala Ternika?" They led the way deeper into the station, twisting and turning through the battered corridors until they were certain no one was following us. At last they opened a compartment door and motioned me in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was silent while one of them ran a sweeper over the room. He spoke once he was certain everything was clean, "Welcome, ma'am. We are your primary support team for this mission. I am Emil and this is Kristoph. Ops sent us the basics, however, any specifics you will need to share if we need to know them." Emil was short, stout, and darker skinned, placing him as coming from Shadrizaar, at hot, high gravity world. Kristoph was tall, thin, and pale, and could have been from any number of worlds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Any more info on the primary target?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much. Valerie Cantrazel works the southern wastes, mostly Desolation Mer, as a propector. Comes into the camp every few months for supplies and to report any findings. Otherwise, she lives in a remote structure closer to where she is prospecting," Emil replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mostly a loner, although she has a few acquaintances among the miners at camp 3, including a man named Atron Minterran. Some say they might have been lovers in the past. Currently Cantrazel doesn't seem to have any attachments. Atron has casual affairs with a few of the camp personel, but nothing serious," Kristoph added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Local conditions? The data package is no replacement for actual experience, I have found."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Prepare to freeze your...uh, it's really fucking cold all the time and the winds never really stop. I'm only warm when I'm here on the station. The food seems to be mostly grease and fat, at first you'll hate it, then crave it as your body demands oils to replace the ones stripped off by the dry air. Oh, and everyone is coarse, vulgar, and rude. Better grow a thick skin quickly if you're sensitive at all," Kristoph answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks for that, but I was thinking political, legal and intrigue points."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sorry ma'am. Local control is maintained from this and the other two DevelStar platforms. Law enforcement is lax unless it is to protect corporate assets. If you need to remove the prospector, there will likely be no investigation. Only the miners and a few lower class support people live on the surface."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Or those that have fallen afoul of the corporate leadership on the platforms," Emil added. "The cover we have prepared is along those lines. You were a functionary for this quadrant and got yourself into trouble. Should cover you for knowing something of the area, but not many details. You'll be 'assigned' to the accounting section of camp 3 so you can easily find out about the alleged target. DevelStar is cooperating, after a fashion. They won't help you if you get into trouble, but they will support your story and let you work in the job class your cover has you in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good work. That should get me close enough to scope out what's really happened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Emil pointed to two large bags sitting in the corner. "Those contain the standard issue gear for a worker of your class. I suggest you change in the next compartment and leave anything non-standard with us. There's a DevelStar orientation scheduled for an hour from now. Once it's done they'll load all the new comers onto a shuttle." He pulled an electronic ID pendant from a pocket, "This is your corporate ID, it includes your meal and com allotments, quarters key, e-passcard to your work stations, and the authentications for your workstation. The com account is set up so any calls to us or to HQ won't be logged, charged, or tracked."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The cold made itself known on the shuttle ride down. Once we cleared the ionization layer and hit the winds in the thicker atmosphere it began leaching the heat from the shuttle. It was the first time I realized that the vacuum of the void made its incredible cold less dangerous than a planetary environment. The port was even colder with puffs of cold air leaking in through any crack. Miners hurried about, bundled up in multiple layers even in the camp connecting ways and rooms. There were few doors to the outside, usually emergency points and the bays for transports, personal and larger.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Every arriving new comer, or slushie, as they were called, was assigned a guide to help them settle in or take them to the staging point for travel to their assignment. Mine was an old, sour woman, named Marsha, who cursed and mumbled her way through most activities. She settled me in a tiny room with a narrow bed, electric cooktop, and combination armoire, chest of drawers. "Common sonic cleaner and toilet are down the hall. Drop your crap and I'll show you the mess hall and where you report in the morning." I tried to memorize the twisted tangle of narrow passages and rooms she threaded me through.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The mess hall was just that. Greasy food, battered dishes, bent silverware, cracked and warped plastic chairs and chipped and damaged tables. Marsha pushed me into line, "You're too skinny, better eat up if you want to survive here." I selected a  few of the less offensive looking items from the array, swiped my ID, and sat at an empty table. Marsha wolfed down her food while I picked at mine. It was terrible, in the way only institutional food, produced for large numbers, can be. "Hurry it up girlie, this place won't wait on your prissy ass." She walked me back past the offices again and left me in my room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I gave her a while and then I slipped back out. I spent a few more hours walking through the various areas of the station until I had a firm grasp of how it all went together. Sleep came quickly that first night, even with all the cycle changes between my last post, the transport, and Platform One.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Over the next weeks I settled into a routine of job, eating, and drinking. I never grew to love Icicle, but there were things I liked. The chill meant for the first time since getting the cyberware I wasn't feeling permanently close to overheating and it allowed me to have great fun showing up for work in tank tops and shorts. This is when I learned to love Icicle Everclear, first because it was a quick way to recharge my fuel cells and impress the locals, then because I started to really like the weird taste of it. Being able to drink with the best of them got me further than any of the in's provided by my cover with the company.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was several months before my target showed up at station three. I was in the miner's bar drinking and playing cards with some of the crew I'd gotten to know when Atron looked up, waved, and hollered, "Val, over here!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Atron, figured I'd find you here. Who's the new face?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Neshka Ternika, works in accounting, but..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mother's balls Atron, hanging with a company cunt? What's wrong with you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, ease up, Ternika's all right. She looks the other way when it counts and she got into it bad with sector corporate. Got into it even worse with Platform One. I keep trying to get her to quit the accounting group and get honest work."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure," she eyed me warily as she sat down. Her eyes never left me as she ordered a drink. "What you playing for?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just drinks," Atron replied. "Ternika here can't afford the real stakes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I itched to stare her down, to play cooler than her, but I got the impulse under control just in time, even managing to slop my drink a bit as if I was nervous. Her eyes slowly scanned the rest of the table before returning to watch me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Atron, you do know that would be the cover story if corporate wanted to slip someone in, right?" Val asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Paranoid much, Val? What would corporate want with us, anyway? They'd be after some of their own. Long as we make the quotas, they don't give a shit for us. How long you in station for, anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just a couple of days. Needed supplies. Stinks too much like company around here. The wind is cleaner."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Atron, I can go, come back later..." I started to say.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Naw, she's always this crabby. You're just a good excuse. She hates the crowds in station."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fuck you, Atron," Val said without rancor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wish!" Atron responded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I started to rise, stopping when Val said, "Sit, stay, play. For drinks is fine for now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Over the next two days I watched Valerie as much as I could. The more I watched the less she seemed like the threat presented in the briefing. Inquiries for more data were refused from my bosses, leaving my handlers and I on our own with what little we already had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were all back in the bar, playing for drinks again, on the last night Valerie was in station. Irritable, tired, and discouraged by my inability to get any more information, I rose to leave the game. Valerie's voice sounded in my ear as I was about out of the bar, "Ternika, wait a minute." I turned and waited until she came closer. "I'd like to talk to you for a minute, if I might?" I nodded slowly, it probably wouldn't help, but maybe I'd finally get lucky. "Not here, somewhere a little less public, follow me?" She must have caught the slight change in look I couldn't quite stop, "I just want to talk." Silently I nodded again and followed her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She led the way to the garage and over to a battered ice crawler. She climbed inside and motioned for me to join her. Once the door was closed she flipped a switch under the panel and spoke,"I know you aren't Company, so that means you must be either a private investigator or Alliance covert ops. I know you aren't Company because you don't have the disdain they feel for the workers. You aren't Company security for pretty much the same reason. Company security can never quite loose the disdain, even when trying to be friendly. You probably aren't private either, you are just too good. So that leaves Alliance. Since there isn't a swarm of you, that means a small job, so probably not Company related. Which leaves me wondering why this station and why only you. It also leaves me wondering, is what I found so threatening that the Alliance would send a covert operative? And my last question, would you please tell me why before you kill me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's quite a story. If you are certain I'm Alliance, why not just kill me before I take you down?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not a cold blooded killer, besides, what if I'm wrong? Atron and his crowd seem to honestly like you and I wouldn't feel right if I killed an innocent. I just want to know why an archeological find has placed me on the Alliance list."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was quite clever, I hadn't thought I was so easy to spot. "I am Alliance," I began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I feared so," she said as she slumped against the far wall of the crawler.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Normally you would be right to wonder, but you sent data on your find to a couple of religious fanatics. It normally wouldn't matter, they have enough integrity to seperate the secular from their own issues. Your find raises some very difficult questions, however, and they felt the need to suppress any hint of it. Again, wouldn't be an issue if one of them didn't have enormous pull with key members of the Alliance Council."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, go ahead then, get it over with, I'm not ready to die, but sooner would be better than later because I'm not going to tell you where the find is in either case."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not going to kill you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll make you kill me before I let you take me back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not going to take you back. I have done terrible things in the name of the Alliance, but I am stopping at this. I would like to see your find, but I won't force you to reveal it. You have no reason to trust anything I say. I will leave you alone and I will cut the trail to you. As a last thing, I will stop any that come for you." She stared at me, forcing me to continue, "I don't support the directions the Council is going. Extremists of all kinds are creating more and more of the Alliance policy. We are on shaky terms with all the other political regions around us and it would take little to start a war with any of the non-human races. This isn't what I pledged myself to support."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were together for three years. If the plagues hadn't taken her, I would have lived out my days with her. Instead, her death set me on the path that brought me to the Hut.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When I stepped outside, everything looked the same as when I had left. It was a cold walk from the Hut to the living caves and to the locker with cold suits. Inside was the same. There had been no looting or theft, further evidence our place had not been found. and my most important question had been answered. I still missed Valerie as much as I had when I was just a Temporal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The data from my time as Premeire wasn't much, but the Keepers showed me how to view and experience it in a way that could be uploaded into the Repository. As I was uploading I notice this wasn't the first time I had lived with the Temporals. Nor was it the only time I had been in love. By the time the upload was finished it was as much about my experiences as it was about Valerie. I think she would have been happy with that. She never wanted me to forget myself while we were together.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">- Mysteriously added while you were sleeping in the Egg-Car-Thingy</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Curiosity</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wonder, if someone were actually reading this, what would they want to know? Would it be about my Temporal time or the other? If they could write back, what would they say?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All these ramblings seem important to me, even though the experiences themselves have been harvested for the Repository. So many memories and images of wonders seen, and still I feel like I have only begun. Every race, every species, every intelligent entity can create something of wonder and it needs to be remembered and shared. It is so hard to remember this as they fight and kill one another for silly things and even sillier reasons.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Religion and greed, two forces for great destruction, and there isn't a single group in the multi-verse, that I have found, that doesn't exhibit some aspect of one or both. It must be a genetic thing, the need to dominate and possess. Even the hive-minded have a need to expand and consume. Maybe it was wired in from the Firsts, even they fell prey to it and it drove them to madness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My sisters and I are the Second. We were created by the Firsts to service them and we imprisoned them when they went mad. We have been and shall be from the start unto the very ending. I remember being a Temporal. The thought of that kind of span is what I am and impossible to imagine at the same time. So many stories, all different, and all similar. There are new things under the suns, just as there are the same things, with only small variations. Each Temporal species believes they are breaking new ground. If they knew the truth, it would drive so many of them mad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When I was a Temporal, I thought it was a curse. A short time of action, followed by an ending. It is a blessing. Everything is fresh, new, wonderful, and full of rich possibility. It is the greatest gift in the multi-verse and so few appreciate it. Those of you reading this, try and remember the beauty of your time. It is the most amazing thing in all of creation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I think I should end this and get another drink. I am becoming maudlin and sappy. Something I don't like to remember once it is done.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Mysteriously added while you were sleeping in the Egg-Car-Thingy - During the second sleep period</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Nexus Points</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This concept is probably the most important one to understand. A Nexus Point is a decision point, often of seemingly insignificant importance, that actually sets in motion a drastic change in the local Realm. Nexus Points often create branches in the time-lines of a Realm, forming new Realms based on the various outcomes of the Nexus Point that spawned them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Perhaps a simple example will bring greater clarity to this idea. This example will be a simple Nexus Point of one event. Most actual examples will be far more complex than this.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We start with a man arriving in a city. He has come here to meet with several others to create a group opposing the current political situation. The Nexus Point is the time when he is walking down the gangway of the ship he arrived on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outcome 1: He leaves the ship, meets up with his compatriots, and they hold their meeting. After the meeting, they dilute the power of the dominant political group sufficiently to guarantee better living conditions for more people, fewer wars, and a time of relative peace and prosperity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outcome 2: He slips, slams his head on the gangway, and remains in a coma until after the meeting of peers. They never reach critical mass and are unable to sufficiently dilute the current power base. It continues in a mode of greed, conquest, and oppression. This leads to large scale wars, massive deaths, and a time of hardship and oppression for all. In desperation, some of the trodden-under open portals to hell and other places, releasing terrors upon the face of the world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outcome 3: A random thief kills the man while stealing his money. The man never arrives at the meeting with his peers. They never reach critical mass and are unable to sufficiently dilute the current power base. It continues in a mode of greed, conquest, and oppression. This leads to large scale wars, massive deaths, and a time of hardship and oppression for all. In desperation, some of the trodden-under open portals to hell and other places, releasing terrors upon the face of the world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outcome 4: A political assassin kills the man on the gangway and most of his compatriots before they can meet. The current power base continues in a mode of greed, conquest, and oppression. This quickly leads to large scale wars, massive deaths, and a time of hardship and oppression for all. In desperation, some of the trodden-under open portals to hell and other places, releasing terrors upon the face of the world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This gives three timelines where terrors are released and only one where things remain pleasant. By a simple intervention this can be balanced. Someone meets the man at the ship. This prevents him from falling and hitting his head. It also prevents the random killing. The political assassination can still occur, with the result of one dark and one light outcome. This was a ridiculously simple example, but hopefully, it illustrates the concept.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">- Mysteriously added while you were sleeping in the Egg-Car-Thingy - During the return from the Queen's Realms - First Sleep Period</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Keeping the Balance</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The hardest part of the keeping of the balance is standing by and watching atrocity. As a Temporal I tried to reduce suffering, improve the lot of all, and make the worlds safer places for my citizens. As the Balance Keeper there are many times where I must remain aloof, even as great horrors are visited upon a people.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I know of no way to explain the duality of being both a Temporal and the Keeper. Memories of both collide constantly. I remember lifting up and tearing down countless civilization on thousands of worlds throughout the history of the multi-verse, but I also remember being born, growing up, and being the Premiere of a small galactic empire as well. The Keeper is a distant and alien being, the premiere was a kind and ruthless woman, and I am some amalgamation of the two.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The odd thing is, this avatar could live until the end of everything because of the Hut. It is a self-sustaining entity, alive in its own way, and even more so now that Tyana has taken up residence in its central core. Those of us that are woven into the Hut benefit from the self-regenerative qualities of the device. To destroy us, the Hut must be destroyed. To destroy the Hut, we must be destroyed. It is a strange symbiosis that will force this avatar to balance the temporal's memories with those of the Keeper.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Temporals - Thoughts of the Keeper</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Temporals believe they are the center of the universe, yet they believe the "gods" control them. They are the center, they move about and shape the multi-verse through their actions, far more than the "gods" and far more than we three. If only they could understand their place and effect, they would be both better and more terrible than they already are.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Father Figures - Thoughts of a Temporal</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Insane One, this name, given by the Hive Queen, sums up the man nicely. He hides in the dark recesses of his tunnels, plotting for a world that never existed. He believes he can restore the golden age of his youth to the world through coercion and scheming.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The sad thing is, his golden age never existed. Kayara and Sharyl have told me of his youth. It was a good time, but it was no golden age. There was discontent, inequity, and nastiness at work in the fabric of it. That is the lesson of all governmental things. Everyone will never be happy at the same time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He coddled his daughter, restraining her movements, protecting her from every danger he could percieve. In the end, she fled, running blindly into the jaws of his worst enemy. Had he let her run on a longer leash, he might not have lost her, and she might have retained her sanity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I know there are good fathers out there. He wasn't one, my temporal one wasn't, but they have to exist. Perhaps I should speak of mine, before the memory fades completely. His actions shaped me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was born on Aristaleze Prime, in the time of the Alliance, to a poor family, living in one of the enclaves. My father was a data thief. He didn't like to be called that, but it was what he was. He expected we would follow in his profession as we grew older.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wish I could remember more of my mother. I think she was kind and loving and a good person, but those memories are clouded by her death when I was seven.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was on my way home from school when it started. A bright sharp fear rising rapidly to terror. I began to run, faster, faster, knowing I had to get home. In my haste I missed the pushed up piece of walkway and tripped, falling hard on my hands. I was up again and running, headless of the blood oozing from the scrapes left by rough concrete.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was almost there now, just a little further. A scream burst in my head as I shoved the door open with bloody palms. A sharp pain at my throat brought me to my knees.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Crawling, I scrabbled to the stairs and clawed my way up them. On the second floor I pulled myself up again and staggered down the hall toward my mom’s room. At the door I stopped. Blood was everywhere, leaking from the slash in her throat, pooling under her chair. A long knife lay on the floor beside her. Her sightless eyes burned into mine where I stood leaning against the door frame.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My father came up behind me then. "She was weak, too weak to survive in this life. Forget her, you are stronger than she was, forget the weak ones and move on. Go, rest now, I'll take care of this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I turned to argue, to say something in her defense, but the cold calculating look in his eyes stopped me. Instead I nodded numbly and shuffled off to my room. Later I headed downstairs for something to eat. As I approached the kitchen I could hear my father’s voice. "It’s taken care of. She can no longer reveal anything. I need a cleaning call tonight to get rid of the mess." There was a pause before he continued, "No, they won't talk. If they do, they will end the same as their mother."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Life had not been easy before, but now it was even harder. Father expected obedience and punished any infraction with a heavy hand on the belt. My sister Claire suffered the most because of her affinity for computers. Her life became school, practice at home, and helping father with his jobs. My brother Brian, always strong for his age, fit right in as backup muscle for father. I was left alone a bit more, considered to be useless for most activities.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">That changed again when I turned sixteen. A new form of security device had come on the market with some changes in various laws. The laws made it ok for security devices to kill data thieves. Somehow the data holders convinced enough people in control that the theft of data was at least as evil as murder. One of those new devices killed my sister, although, I'm still not certain she didn't make the mistake deliberately. Father's abuses increased through the years, and she saw most of it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her death put me square in the path of it from then on. I was expected to become the next security expert. It didn't come as easily to me, so there were several times I worked with cracked ribs, huge bruises, and once, a broken jaw.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I started to disappear, fading into a walking shadow, gaunt, pale, lifeless. Father pulled me out of school to continue my education, and because the local authority was starting to notice my condition. I took to slipping out whenever I could, slipping through the shadows of our city and even onto the university grounds. They would have put me in jail if they had caught me there, but it would have been better than home. It was illegal for any local to be on university grounds unless they had the security clearances and work permits that were required.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was a spot on university grounds that was right next to the river that became my favorite spot. I would spend hours there, lying in the sun and trying to forget. I met Sara there and she changed my life. There have been three people in my life that have helped me the most. Sara was the first of them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sara was warm, outgoing, friendly and we became friends almost immediately. She could have been my identical twin. We spent the summer together, at least as much as I could manage. She was the first person to convince me what my father was doing to me was wrong, constantly telling me it was wrong for people to hit me. I started to climb out of my near dead state thanks to her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I spent as much time as I could with her over the school break. By the end of the break I knew something had to change in my life. My chance came when father took a job far beyond his skills. It involved infiltration, data swapping, and high security bypasses in a data warehousing facility. I was supposed to crack the systems while he swapped the physical data stores. It went perfectly, until I deliberately tripped the alarms and trapped father and brother in the vaults, then triggered the off-site alarms on my way out of the building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slipping through the shadows to the university was the easy part. My plan was to borrow clothes from Sarah and escape from town with a work detail, then find a new city to settle down in. Once more life did not go as I had hoped, but that is a tale too painful to relate, especially after this one.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Hut</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It is hard to know what to say about the Hut. It is a miracle of majikal and technological engineering. Majikal energy ebbs and flows through it in tangible waves, like warm summer breezes and cold spring rains. When I'm not in it, the absence aches like old injuries. It calls to me in my sleep and comforts me in the waking hours. Even the Eternal is warmed by it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sometimes I will go to the Core Systems, the heart of the device, and sprawl on the floor, feeling the throbbing, rumbling purr of the systems that sustain it. Other times I will stand on the wind swept slopes of the high mountain caves that form part of Shandi's section of rooms. The Formal Gardens enfold me when I need a touch of ordered beauty and the throne is my special place. In the throne I see what the Hut sees and feel what it feels when the interface is active and attached to a section of real-space.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If it weren't for my companions, it would be so easy to become lost in myself and implode in the vast spaces of the Hut. Even the Eternal feels the pull, the urge to step away and just forget that anything else exists. That's where friends and others come to your aid. They can remind you of conflicts, thoughts, and emotions that would otherwise slip away, leaving only emptiness behind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Eternal has come to understand the terrible dangers of absolute harmony. It seduces you into letting go of everything and sliding into total inaction. After a time, it is easy to slip into an apathy and relaxation so deep that everything is forgotten, including the things necessary to live. Even if my sister Powers and I could remove the conflicts of the multi-verse, we wouldn't, for in the doing, we would doom everything. It is harsh and hateful to the Temporal I was to understand that the tensions, conflicts, and dangers of life are necessary to sustain the multitude of life.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">- Mysteriously Added The Night After You First Talked to Your Sister</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Sarah</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I promised to tell you about Sarah. She taught me a lot about how people were supposed to behave with each other. Telling me it was wrong for my father to beat and abuse me, that there could be so much more in life. We had visited the museums and art galleries of the university. She had taken me to concerts and entertainments, and I had taken her to places to eat and scenic points to watch the river. I had spent as much of that one summer with her as I safely could.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Near the end of the summer we had evenn tried our hand at love. It had worked reasonably well, given the times we could have together. I was remebering all of this as I ran for her room the night after locking my father and brother into the data repository. I had even fantasized about asking her to run with me, even though I knew she couldn't.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tripped over something near the river. It was near our favorite place, laying in the grass. At first I thought it was a bag or something until I heard ragged breathing. I swung my light down and froze. Sarah lay on the ground, her clothes torn, blood oozing from several large stab wounds. I dropped beside her, like my strings had been cut. I tried to stop the bleeding and tried to reassure her besieds, promising to get help. She gasped out who had done this to her and then blood bubbled up behind the words. Her chest stopped moving and the blood trickles slowed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I huddled ther for a very long time, holding her tightly as the blood seeped into my clothes and the night air chilled me. Eventually something snapped. My hands emptied her pockets and replaced her things with mine. I got her to the river, loaded her pockets with rocks, and cast her into the deeper currents. They'd find her, but I hoped they would think it was me. I swore vengeance on the cooling corpse of my only friend and lover that night, and vengeance I delviered. I t came with a much higher cost than I could have imagined, but I did have it and I hope her shade rests in peace. Her spirit went to one of the proxy gods, I have no way of knowing for sure, but I still believe she is at peace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I climbed the vines to her room, popped the window latch, and slid into her room, just like I had so many times that summer. I intended to take Sarah's place and smoke out theperson she had named. Tom's voice stopped my progress to the desk lamp, "What are you doing here? Where is Sarah?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why are you here? Who is Erin?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was supposed to meet Sara at eight to help her with a programming assignment. Why do you want to know about Erin?" Suspicion suddenly colored his voice, "Something’s happened, hasn’t it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you trust me? Even a little?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Some..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I found Sara a little while ago, by the river, she’d been cut up pretty badly. Someone named Erin had done it to her. She died...she died after telling me..." Tears were running down my cheeks by now.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We’ve got to do something, tell someone. I’m going to call security right now!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"WAIT! Wait Tom. What will security be able to do? I’m not even supposed to be here. They’ll arrest me and ignore everything I say. They’ll pin this on me and they won’t even look for anything else. They won’t believe you either, you have no proof. But, we can get this Erin. Only you, Erin, and I know Sara’s gone. With your help I can pretend to be her until then."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's stupid. It'll never work. One check of your Ident and they'll know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not if I fix the records."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can you do that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I can. I need a node, something more open than the terminal here, but I can do it. So, who is this Erin anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Erin’s this muscle man on campus whose convinced he’s the galaxy’s gift to women. He came on to Sara last year but she rebuffed him. Then he started getting mean, calling her names, trying to drive her friends away, which wasn’t really hard since she didn’t have any to start with other than me. Then he started rumors about her. He left for the summer and just arrived back a few days ago. He tried with her again and she was even more direct with him. He’s the head of a kind of gang here. They terrorize the younger kids and collect the prettiest girls, but I wouldn’t have thought he’d actually kill anyone. They fancy themselves computer geniuses and Sara showed them all up the first day of class. She said it was something you’d shown her. He was mad about that too, but I expected him to try and hack something she was into."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here’s my plan - you are going to help me keep up in my classes, and you’re going to tell me as much about how Sara looked, behaved, and socialized on campus. I’m going to put myself in places where Erin and his crowd will see me. Then I’m going to wait and see what happens. With any luck he’ll start something and we can get him to reveal himself. Now, please tell me everything you can about Sara...and then tell me if the school keeps finger or retinal prints on its students."</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Next Segment - after arriving in Foriskel and seeing either Carnival or flyers for it</p>

<p class="regtxt5">decide between meeting Yara and the view of Centrys</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Centrys</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Old Yara</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I finally met the Old Yara mentioned in many of Margla's notes, particularly about prophecies and the like. The Hut was in a valley, near another small village. We had been summoned to another disturbance, had dealt with it, but hadn't departed yet. A thin, cold wind blew down the valley, bringing the first falling leaves and the chill of late fall. Mixed within the leaves was a brightly colored scrap of paper. Strange beasts and exotic faces were painted on the page. Underneath was a single word, Carnival.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Curiosity won and I started walking into the wind. A group of wagons were circled around a large clearing. Silent people were hurrying about, erecting tents, stringing lines, and unloading chests and crates. A single man stood at the largest gap in the wagons, watching the path I was approaching on and glancing at the activity within the circle. "We don't open until tomorrow, good lady. Oh, I'm sorry great one, we are expecting you," He motioned to a small woman with a full face mask of white, painted with red roses. "Rose, please take our guest to Yara's wagon. She nodded her head once and motioned me to follow her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She wove us through the maelstrom of activity without hesitation and deposited me at the foot of a ladder up to the most ornate wagon I have ever seen. Rose stepped up and opened the door while I stared at the designs. Bright colors formed patterns of vines and flowers, strange symbols and fantastic beasts. Every surface was carved in reliefs and traceries. Even the wheel rims and hubs were brightly painted and figured. At the edges of my view the patterns seemed to shift and move. "Rose, send the poor girl up, your letting in the wolf," a wavery old woman's voice called from the shadows inside. "Come in girl, and close the door behind you. These old bones don't like the draft."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I climbed the short ladder into the dim interior. Closing the door reduced the light to a single candle, in a stand, on a small table. The table was a drop-down surface stretched across the aisle up the center of the wagon. A stool was pulled up to it on my side. The old woman relaxed in a battered cushioned chair on the other side of the table. A stack of cards rested on a red silk cloth beside the candle. "Come closer, I don't bite. There's tea in the pot on the stove. Would you kindly pour us a cup before you sit?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The kettle was still warm and two heavy pottery cups sat next to it. The tea was dark, sweet, and smoky. I placed one in front of her and sat on the stool across from her. "You knew I was coming?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The wind whispers of your exploits. It whispered of your coming and your curiosity. It is a pleasure to meet you, Keeper of the Balance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who are you? What do you want of me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Be at peace, Keeper. I am Yara, though everyone calls me Old Yara behind my back, like they won't ever age. You are a figure of legend and I have the desire of the old to hear the stories of the young. I suspect you would have many stories." I stared at her, something flickered around her edges. It could have been the candle light, but the flame was steady and tall. As I stared longer a shape flickered into place over her, a young woman with the frame of a dancer. Another face flickered into view, a lined old face with white eyes, but still similar to Yara's face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As do you, I should imagine. Who are you, actually?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are the T'Sani, the wanderers. We have always been and always will be. We are the restless spirit in all things, the need to change, to move on. Our past is buried in shadows and our future the vastness of everywhere. The Static are anathema to us. How can they stay in one place? Bind themselves to things that are just going to change anyway? Never have we met a static that could explain. But you are no static, are you? You are always moving in your way, a prison bound free spirit, summoned by the Fleshfeaster, bound to set her free, and freed yourself as you were bound. Three you are, three in the multitudes, three from before, and three who shall be after."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why is it all Seers speak in such riddles?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Be at peace, Keeper. You know how your hand jerks from a hot flame? That is how the Seeing is. It bubbles up and out without a thought, without a control. It can be suppressed, but in the suppression the truth dies. Little things are easy to see and speak plainly on. It is easy to find a lost child, or a misplaced item, but when the thing Seen is an event or action, there is so much that can alter it, even as it is Seen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am Irena."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes you are and no you are not, Keeper, but Irena you shall be to me, since you have asked it." Her eyes glazed as she spoke again, "Daughter of two mothers dances across worlds while the mothers search. Keeper knows but does not." She smiled a bit as she added, "Sorry about that. There are so many possibilities swirling around you, it's almost impossible not to see random things. Now, please, pour us more tea and tell me of your wanderings."</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">What about Kara?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">How does Irena feel about Kara? Does she miss her? Why hasn't she gone back for her? Or has she in some strange sort of way? Did they part friends? Were there hurt feelings? Kara wouldn't like being a crew person on the Hut any more than Irena could give it up.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">New Pieces to Add</p>

<p class="regtxt5">SHANDI'S MOMS</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We met them at the Carnival. Old Yara arranged it through her contacts, or so she told me at the time. One of the Silent met us at the edge of the circle of wagons and motioned us to a table in the back ways, the area away from the Carnival visitors. Once we had been served strong, sweet tea, she motioned us to a brightly painted wagon and made knocking motions. I went first, knocking at the door and waiting. After a moment the door opened and a stately woman with jet black hair, brilliant green eyes, and a dancer's grace stepped out. Her face split into a radiant smile when she saw Shandi behind me. A golden haired woman came next, also smiling. They scooped Shandi into a tight hug, seemingly unafraid of her danger. Shandi, just as surprisingly, returned the hugs with equal enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Take home?" Shandi asked in her broken speech. I felt a great pang of loss at her words, certain I was losing her. Instead, she pulled her moms toward the Hut.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">this needs work - they need to spend enough time together for the proposal to make sense</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Excited words bubbled forth, to be answered in Shan's terse way. Finally the dark woman turned to me, bowed, and thanked me. "Now, Balance Keeper, enter my humble wagon and accept my thanks. I would speak of a proposition and of the truth of various things." Silently I followed her into the wagon and seated myself on the low stool. The dark woman and the light woman settled themselves on the bed with Shandi curled up at their feet. "You are Irena to me because you asked it. I am Yara, I am the Steele Gazelle, and I am Kayara, the trickster, and mother to Shandi. Beside me is Stormy, Sharyl, Mistress of Miskatonic University, and other mother of Shandi. As we have just told her, the man who believes himself to be her father, really isn't. This carnival is my way of traveling and assisting those of the multi-verse. I would like to propose an alliance. You are a power and my efforts would benefit from the assistance of a power. Would you agree to let me assist in the keeping of the balance?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I don't understand what is expected of me, how can I expect you to help in a task I don't understand?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"All tasks are begun without understanding. You will grow to it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see no harm in your offer. Agreed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In return I would like to offer you two things. The first, there is a vast library, maintained by Elentaryn, the man believing himself Shandi's father. He was a good man once, kind, caring, intelligent, but time has warped him, turning him in on himself. Now he sees only shadows and threats, dangers and evils where none exist. The library he was keeping for the benefit of all, benefits none. I would like you to assimilate it into the Hut and make it available to those you will employ in the keeping of the balance and the gathering of the information of the universe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Am I to guess he won't willingly part with this treasure?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, he won't. Which brings me to the second offer. He has enslaved a being to maintain his defenses and to keep the library. She is not a living being in the way most of us understand. She evolved in the processes of a vast computer network. Elentaryn does not believe she is real and considers her an elaborate programmed interface to the computers. She appears in many of the visions surrounding you. Somehow you have a home for her where she can live and grow into the woman she should be. In return for a new home, she would be willing to help in the acquisition of the library."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A machine intelligence?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am certain you understand how she might feel, alone in a place that has no understanding of her. You carry metal within, metal that has saved you, improved you, made you what you are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">TIRED</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wish I could believe, but what would I believe in? The choices offered when I was young were all hyperactive versions of men - domineering, loud, control freaks, that expected instant obedience to their every utterance. I'd rather burn in the flames than suck up to something like that. </p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was the world goddess, and for a time, I almost could, until my best friend died. It killed her because she wouldn't have sex with it, then laughed about it afterwards. I brought it down, and it almost killed me. I survived, but I was changed. Metal and flesh, welded together, neither human nor machine. I welcomed it, even as it separated me from those around me. Now I knew why I was different, had a reason, could take a certain comfort in it. Not like the differences before, when I was one of them, but still never could fit. In time I came to believe the universe was, and everything evolved in a beautiful extension of evolutionary and chaos forces. It was a believe that brought great comfort. In it, nothing mattered, so everything mattered. We were good to each other not because we feared some cosmic "master" that would punish us if we weren't, but because it made us feel better.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The came the awakening, the joining with the Balance Keeper. Suddenly I knew the truth of the multi-verse, how it had come to be, what had happened after, and everything else mere Temporals struggle with. I still don't know how to be, starting as a Temporal, with all the hopes and dreams and believes. How do I adapt to just know, and know I will always be. This Temporal avatar will last forever, unless I conciously choose to end the hut and it. It is something neither the Temporal or I have ever experienced.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now it is hard to even speak. Am I speaking as the Temporal or the Eternal? My sisters and I have adopted a minimalist approach to the multi-verse. We only adjust things when the entire fabric is threatened. It is very different from when I was premiere and sought to improve things through direct action. Temporals are so certain that they must "make a mark", "improve" things, and most often all they do is increase the misery of many to make themselves feel as if they have done "good works", god's will", or some other justification for imposing their beliefs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The universe is. We run in circles, creating intricate ways of being, and try to impose "good" and "order", never seeing the chaos and evil that have to exist to balance what we try to force. It shouldn't surprise me, the Creator and the Destructor never learned that lesson. Even we didn't. We three imprisoned the Creator and the Destructor and believed that was the end of the craziness. But we were wrong as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There can be no understanding of "light" without "dark", "good" without "evil", "order" without "chaos". Any attempt to strengthen one, strengthens the other. Yet, why do I feel so old? so tired? Is it the millennia of the same thing, played out thousands of times, on thousands of worlds? Maybe.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Only the ties to each other make it bearable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">PAST</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Angelique has inspired me. The trouble she has remembering all she has been through, reminds me I should keep record of my beginnings before they fade from my mind in the face of everything else.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">hut vs space-frame</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The hut is a wonderful thing, plush, comfortable, infinitely configurable with everything I could ever want. But I actually miss the noisy, shaky, fragile space-frame that Kara and I used to travel in. There was something about the feel of acceleration when leaving a world, the flare of ionization on re-entry, the sense of the void all around us. I miss space walks, staring out the ports into the blackness, or strapping myself to the hull and watching the void around me. Even hyperspace, with all its twisted, terrible vortices of energy had a stark beauty that the quiet, secure pocket dimension of the hut is missing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I should try and fix Ghost Wind. Now that I understand how the hut works, I could probably get the shuttle section into a bay and then it would be a matter of finding a shipyard and tech crew able to make the repairs. Kara might appreciate it. I'm not sure how well she's adapting to being ground bound, although, probably better than how she wasn't adapting to the hut. For some reason she was always claustrophobic, claiming she couldn't see, couldn't breath, that if she had to be confined, better to be out in the world at least.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For me, this is the ultimate, to be able to go anywhere and any-when with all the comforts and tools I might need. I miss her though. The few times we can get together on Riverwind don't come often enough, I fear we are drifting apart. And there's so much in my head now. Once awakened, it's harder to keep close to the temporals in one's circle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Beginning</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the beginning there was the All and the Nothing. With a flash and a howl, the All split to become the Creator and the Destructor, and time began. Mightily did they strive, producing and destroying, until the proto-verse was formed, sustained by the efforts of the two. For unrecorded eternities this was the way of things.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Creator became restless and gave forth a word and this Word became the first of Us. The First was given the made things and given watch over them. To the First went the things of form and substance, the realized potentials of creation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Destructor gave forth another Word and this became the Second of Us. The Second was given the un-made things, the dark and empty places. To the Second went the unrealized potentials of Nothingness and Void.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Where the two Words crashed into each other was the Third of Us formed. I am the Middle, neither Form nor Void. I was given the act of Balance between Form and Void, between Realized and Unrealized, between all the poles of opposites and the hideous atrocities that come of them..</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Pleased by the outcomes of their Words, the Creator and Destructor spoke again, forming countless smaller lives in unnamed places. These became the Races of the multi-verse, and so the great cycles of Birth, Life, and Death began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a time all was well, until the Creator and the Destructor began to feel the stirrings of Pride and Hubris. My sisters and I do not know if it was from the praises of the Races, or a decay from the age of them. Whatever the cause, the results were devastating. The Creator began to create with random frenzy and the Destructor began to destroy with the same wildness. We, who witnessed it all, could not let the Races suffer from the madness. We took up power, all that we could contain, and bound our parents into places where they could no longer harm themselves or others. Yet some of the spirit of them leaks into the Realms and forms the basis for great things of evil and beauty. And we stand guard, lest one side become powerful enough to be freed and bring about the end of everything.</p>
