<p class="pagecaption">Margla Fleshfeaster</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Legend holds she was the creator of the Hut of All Worlds, then known as the Hut of the Fleshfeaster. None can confirm her as the creator.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Fleshfeaster is said to come from the long ago times, the times of the Ancients. A great curse befell her, turning her into a flesh consuming monster. Other legends say her prefered food is fresh babies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Other legends tell of her as a dispenser of lore. If the supplicant can appeal to her curiosity or thirst for knowledge they may gain the answer to a deep question or dark problem. Failure results in becoming one of her meals. Many have sought this, however, few have returned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Other legends link her to M'Lara Iridal, the Mistress of the School of Magic at Skelos, City of the Well. How the Fleashfeaster and M'Lara Iridal could be the same being defies comprehension. It is the difference of Dark and Light, yet the legend remains, never quite disproven.</p>
