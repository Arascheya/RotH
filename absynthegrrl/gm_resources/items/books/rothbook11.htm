<p class="sectioncaption">NWN 1, Campaign Start</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A woman once asked me, "Don't you want to settle down, raise a family, become a part of a community?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All I could think was, "Only in my worst nightmares. To be ground bound, stuck on some gods forsaken rock, would be a hell from which I would run screaming. I embraced the Hut of All Worlds, the Hut of Margla Fleshfeaster. I reveled in the knowledge that I could go anywhere and any when, and never have I regretted the price of admission."</p>

<!-- section 2 - added for start of campaign - make this a living doc - Irena can dynamically update it - when she does, there will be the deep gong of the Hut percievable by the owner of the book only -->
<p class="sectioncaption">Campaign Start - given to Bill's Character</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tannhauser Gate. I have looked upon it at last. The reports did it no justice, did not capture the strangeness of it, the size of it. When time allows we must return and investigate. Surely there is something left in the massive complexes nearby that may provide clues. If we can't decipher it, likely none can.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I thought science would explain the universe. It still might, but Centrys throws up so many exceptions to the theories I learned as fact so long ago. How can a city sit at the center of a "multi-verse"? How can an infinite place have a center or an edge? How can a "multi-verse" exist? How can a place have attachment points with every other possible place? How can there be a place for every possibility ever imagined, and for those not imagined by any I know, as well?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I would have thought it impossible, yet I have seen it. There is so much to see and so little time. Even if time is infinite, how can it ever be seen, explored, understood?</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">On Riverwind - given to Bill's Character</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When my friend gave me my essence, it didn't seem real. The Repository convinced me. Its beautiful. A gleaming marble and granite temple stands over the stairwell down to the data chambers. It winds down five hundred feet around an open light well and ends on a floor of red granite. Enormous bronze doors stand open to welcome the visitor to the reception hall. Keepers move about their tasks with quiet dignity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They greeted me with warmth and welcome, glad I had finally returned to them. One motioned a snake bodied, six armed woman from a side area where she was working. "Mistress, you should know the great news. Klktzash has been elevated to the Keepers. Her assistance to other researchers during her time here has been of great benefit to all and her depths of understanding of the levels of the Abyss has expanded the demonic data wing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was so happy! I had worried when she had resigned as Hut Librarian that she would end up back in the Abyss.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They conducted me on a complete tour of the repository, my repository as they constantly reminded me. Towering grottos of glowing crystal soared over me. Inside the clear surfaces memories and data pulsed in glowing purple motes and swirls. Researchers from across the multi-verse were wired into strangely shaped interface machines, scanning for esoteric lore. Keepers moved about, providing sustenance, advice, and reminding the researchers to periodically break from their routine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was about to leave when a Keeper hurried up. "Mistress, you should come and see. A Gatherer has returned." She motioned me after her and led the way to a side chamber. Within it a spider-like creature rested on a bed of silk. Two Keepers were carrying it toward an ancient device. Reverently they placed the pillow into a small chamber and swung the door closed. Images flashed and flickered on a large screen, coalescing into a steady stream of memory, recovered from the Gatherer and added to the repository.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the task was finished, the Gatherer was removed from the machine and taken to a place of rest. There it would rest and recover before leaving to once again gather information from around the multi-verse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The part of me that was still me wanted to know how long this place had been. The part of me that was not me, but had been returned to me, knew it was as old as the multi-verse itself. Created by the Balance Keeper to hold everything the multi-verse had discovered about itself. Another reminder of what I had been, and what I had become.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I still wonder what I have become. What has happened to the me that ruled the Human Empire in the time before the Razaks came and wrought havoc upon it.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Past - Part of the Entries for Azkelon</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Angelique has inspired me. The trouble she has remembering all she has been through, reminds me I should keep record of my beginnings before they fade from my mind in the face of everything else.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Return to Icicle</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I returned to Icicle today. My excuse was to pick up some data I had stashed there when I was Premiere, however, the real reason was much more personal. Some of the best years of my life had been spent there and I wanted to see if the changes had altered those memories. I had forgotten the cold beauty of the place and it reminded me of the first time I saw it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I first saw Icicle as the transport ship swung in to dock at Platform One. There was a cold beauty to the white ball floating in the blackness that I hadn't expected. The briefing docs painted a bleak picture of a frozen world inhabited only by the miners forced to work there. Bitter cold, freezing winds, and hard effort to drag out chemicals for use in pharmaceuticals and beauty aids were all it was known for.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was met at the grimy dock by two scruffy men in miner garb. "Neshkala Ternika?" They led the way deeper into the station, twisting and turning through the battered corridors until they were certain no one was following us. At last they opened a compartment door and motioned me in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was silent while one of them ran a sweeper over the room. He spoke once he was certain everything was clean, "Welcome, ma'am. We are your primary support team for this mission. I am Emil and this is Kristoph. Ops sent us the basics, however, any specifics you will need to share if we need to know them." Emil was short, stout, and darker skinned, placing him as coming from Shadrizaar, at hot, high gravity world. Kristoph was tall, thin, and pale, and could have been from any number of worlds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Any more info on the primary target?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much. Valerie Cantrazel works the southern wastes, mostly Desolation Mer, as a propector. Comes into the camp every few months for supplies and to report any findings. Otherwise, she lives in a remote structure closer to where she is prospecting," Emil replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mostly a loner, although she has a few acquaintances among the miners at camp 3, including a man named Atron Minterran. Some say they might have been lovers in the past. Currently Cantrazel doesn't seem to have any attachments. Atron has casual affairs with a few of the camp personel, but nothing serious," Kristoph added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Local conditions? The data package is no replacement for actual experience, I have found."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Prepare to freeze your...uh, it's really fucking cold all the time and the winds never really stop. I'm only warm when I'm here on the station. The food seems to be mostly grease and fat, at first you'll hate it, then crave it as your body demands oils to replace the ones stripped off by the dry air. Oh, and everyone is coarse, vulgar, and rude. Better grow a thick skin quickly if you're sensitive at all," Kristoph answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks for that, but I was thinking political, legal and intrigue points."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sorry ma'am. Local control is maintained from this and the other two DevelStar platforms. Law enforcement is lax unless it is to protect corporate assets. If you need to remove the prospector, there will likely be no investigation. Only the miners and a few lower class support people live on the surface."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Or those that have fallen afoul of the corporate leadership on the platforms," Emil added. "The cover we have prepared is along those lines. You were a functionary for this quadrant and got yourself into trouble. Should cover you for knowing something of the area, but not many details. You'll be 'assigned' to the accounting section of camp 3 so you can easily find out about the alleged target. DevelStar is cooperating, after a fashion. They won't help you if you get into trouble, but they will support your story and let you work in the job class your cover has you in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good work. That should get me close enough to scope out what's really happened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Emil pointed to two large bags sitting in the corner. "Those contain the standard issue gear for a worker of your class. I suggest you change in the next compartment and leave anything non-standard with us. There's a DevelStar orientation scheduled for an hour from now. Once it's done they'll load all the new comers onto a shuttle." He pulled an electronic ID pendant from a pocket, "This is your corporate ID, it includes your meal and com allotments, quarters key, e-passcard to your work stations, and the authentications for your workstation. The com account is set up so any calls to us or to HQ won't be logged, charged, or tracked."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The cold made itself known on the shuttle ride down. Once we cleared the ionization layer and hit the winds in the thicker atmosphere it began leaching the heat from the shuttle. It was the first time I realized that the vacuum of the void made its incredible cold less dangerous than a planetary environment. The port was even colder with puffs of cold air leaking in through any crack. Miners hurried about, bundled up in multiple layers even in the camp connecting ways and rooms. There were few doors to the outside, usually emergency points and the bays for transports, personal and larger.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Every arriving new comer, or slushie, as they were called, was assigned a guide to help them settle in or take them to the staging point for travel to their assignment. Mine was an old, sour woman, named Marsha, who cursed and mumbled her way through most activities. She settled me in a tiny room with a narrow bed, electric cooktop, and combination armoire, chest of drawers. "Common sonic cleaner and toilet are down the hall. Drop your crap and I'll show you the mess hall and where you report in the morning." I tried to memorize the twisted tangle of narrow passages and rooms she threaded me through.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The mess hall was just that. Greasy food, battered dishes, bent silverware, cracked and warped plastic chairs and chipped and damaged tables. Marsha pushed me into line, "You're too skinny, better eat up if you want to survive here." I selected a  few of the less offensive looking items from the array, swiped my ID, and sat at an empty table. Marsha wolfed down her food while I picked at mine. It was terrible, in the way only institutional food, produced for large numbers, can be. "Hurry it up girlie, this place won't wait on your prissy ass." She walked me back past the offices again and left me in my room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I gave her a while and then I slipped back out. I spent a few more hours walking through the various areas of the station until I had a firm grasp of how it all went together. Sleep came quickly that first night, even with all the cycle changes between my last post, the transport, and Platform One.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Over the next weeks I settled into a routine of job, eating, and drinking. I never grew to love Icicle, but there were things I liked. The chill meant for the first time since getting the cyberware I wasn't feeling permanently close to overheating and it allowed me to have great fun showing up for work in tank tops and shorts. This is when I learned to love Icicle Everclear, first because it was a quick way to recharge my fuel cells and impress the locals, then because I started to really like the weird taste of it. Being able to drink with the best of them got me further than any of the in's provided by my cover with the company.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was several months before my target showed up at station three. I was in the miner's bar drinking and playing cards with some of the crew I'd gotten to know when Atron looked up, waved, and hollered, "Val, over here!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Atron, figured I'd find you here. Who's the new face?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Neshka Ternika, works in accounting, but..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mother's balls Atron, hanging with a company cunt? What's wrong with you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, ease up, Ternika's all right. She looks the other way when it counts and she got into it bad with sector corporate. Got into it even worse with Platform One. I keep trying to get her to quit the accounting group and get honest work."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure," she eyed me warily as she sat down. Her eyes never left me as she ordered a drink. "What you playing for?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just drinks," Atron replied. "Ternika here can't afford the real stakes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I itched to stare her down, to play cooler than her, but I got the impulse under control just in time, even managing to slop my drink a bit as if I was nervous. Her eyes slowly scanned the rest of the table before returning to watch me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Atron, you do know that would be the cover story if corporate wanted to slip someone in, right?" Val asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Paranoid much, Val? What would corporate want with us, anyway? They'd be after some of their own. Long as we make the quotas, they don't give a shit for us. How long you in station for, anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just a couple of days. Needed supplies. Stinks too much like company around here. The wind is cleaner."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Atron, I can go, come back later..." I started to say.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Naw, she's always this crabby. You're just a good excuse. She hates the crowds in station."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fuck you, Atron," Val said without rancor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wish!" Atron responded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I started to rise, stopping when Val said, "Sit, stay, play. For drinks is fine for now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Over the next two days I watched Valerie as much as I could. The more I watched the less she seemed like the threat presented in the briefing. Inquiries for more data were refused from my bosses, leaving my handlers and I on our own with what little we already had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were all back in the bar, playing for drinks again, on the last night Valerie was in station. Irritable, tired, and discouraged by my inability to get any more information, I rose to leave the game. Valerie's voice sounded in my ear as I was about out of the bar, "Ternika, wait a minute." I turned and waited until she came closer. "I'd like to talk to you for a minute, if I might?" I nodded slowly, it probably wouldn't help, but maybe I'd finally get lucky. "Not here, somewhere a little less public, follow me?" She must have caught the slight change in look I couldn't quite stop, "I just want to talk." Silently I nodded again and followed her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She led the way to the garage and over to a battered ice crawler. She climbed inside and motioned for me to join her. Once the door was closed she flipped a switch under the panel and spoke,"I know you aren't Company, so that means you must be either a private investigator or Alliance covert ops. I know you aren't Company because you don't have the disdain they feel for the workers. You aren't Company security for pretty much the same reason. Company security can never quite loose the disdain, even when trying to be friendly. You probably aren't private either, you are just too good. So that leaves Alliance. Since there isn't a swarm of you, that means a small job, so probably not Company related. Which leaves me wondering why this station and why only you. It also leaves me wondering, is what I found so threatening that the Alliance would send a covert operative? And my last question, would you please tell me why before you kill me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's quite a story. If you are certain I'm Alliance, why not just kill me before I take you down?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not a cold blooded killer, besides, what if I'm wrong? Atron and his crowd seem to honestly like you and I wouldn't feel right if I killed an innocent. I just want to know why an archeological find has placed me on the Alliance list."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was quite clever, I hadn't thought I was so easy to spot. "I am Alliance," I began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I feared so," she said as she slumped against the far wall of the crawler.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Normally you would be right to wonder, but you sent data on your find to a couple of religious fanatics. It normally wouldn't matter, they have enough integrity to seperate the secular from their own issues. Your find raises some very difficult questions, however, and they felt the need to suppress any hint of it. Again, wouldn't be an issue if one of them didn't have enormous pull with key members of the Alliance Council."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, go ahead then, get it over with, I'm not ready to die, but sooner would be better than later because I'm not going to tell you where the find is in either case."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not going to kill you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll make you kill me before I let you take me back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not going to take you back. I have done terrible things in the name of the Alliance, but I am stopping at this. I would like to see your find, but I won't force you to reveal it. You have no reason to trust anything I say. I will leave you alone and I will cut the trail to you. As a last thing, I will stop any that come for you." She stared at me, forcing me to continue, "I don't support the directions the Council is going. Extremists of all kinds are creating more and more of the Alliance policy. We are on shaky terms with all the other political regions around us and it would take little to start a war with any of the non-human races. This isn't what I pledged myself to support."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were together for three years. If the plagues hadn't taken her, I would have lived out my days with her. Instead, her death set me on the path that brought me to the Hut.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When I stepped outside, everything looked the same as when I had left. It was a cold walk from the Hut to the living caves and to the locker with cold suits. Inside was the same. There had been no looting or theft, further evidence our place had not been found. and my most important question had been answered. I still missed Valerie as much as I had when I was just a Temporal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The data from my time as Premeire wasn't much, but the Keepers showed me how to view and experience it in a way that could be uploaded into the Repository. As I was uploading I notice this wasn't the first time I had lived with the Temporals. Nor was it the only time I had been in love. By the time the upload was finished it was as much about my experiences as it was about Valerie. I think she would have been happy with that. She never wanted me to forget myself while we were together.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Curiosity</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wonder, if someone were actually reading this, what would they want to know? Would it be about my Temporal time or the other? If they could write back, what would they say?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All these ramblings seem important to me, even though the experiences themselves have been harvested for the Repository. So many memories and images of wonders seen, and still I feel like I have only begun. Every race, every species, every intelligent entity can create something of wonder and it needs to be remembered and shared. It is so hard to remember this as they fight and kill one another for silly things and even sillier reasons.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Religion and greed, two forces for great destruction, and there isn't a single group in the multi-verse, that I have found, that doesn't exhibit some aspect of one or both. It must be a genetic thing, the need to dominate and possess. Even the hive-minded have a need to expand and consume. Maybe it was wired in from the Firsts, even they fell prey to it and it drove them to madness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My sisters and I are the Second. We were created by the Firsts to service them and we imprisoned them when they went mad. We have been and shall be from the start unto the very ending. I remember being a Temporal. The thought of that kind of span is what I am and impossible to imagine at the same time. So many stories, all different, and all similar. There are new things under the suns, just as there are the same things, with only small variations. Each Temporal species believes they are breaking new ground. If they knew the truth, it would drive so many of them mad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When I was a Temporal, I thought it was a curse. A short time of action, followed by an ending. It is a blessing. Everything is fresh, new, wonderful, and full of rich possibility. It is the greatest gift in the multi-verse and so few appreciate it. Those of you reading this, try and remember the beauty of your time. It is the most amazing thing in all of creation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I think I should end this and get another drink. I am becoming maudlin and sappy. Something I don't like to remember once it is done.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Nexus Points</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This concept is probably the most important one to understand. A Nexus Point is a decision point, often of seemingly insignificant importance, that actually sets in motion a drastic change in the local Realm. Nexus Points often create branches in the time-lines of a Realm, forming new Realms based on the various outcomes of the Nexus Point that spawned them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Perhaps a simple example will bring greater clarity to this idea. This example will be a simple Nexus Point of one event. Most actual examples will be far more complex than this.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We start with a man arriving in a city. He has come here to meet with several others to create a group opposing the current political situation. The Nexus Point is the time when he is walking down the gangway of the ship he arrived on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outcome 1: He leaves the ship, meets up with his compatriots, and they hold their meeting. After the meeting, they dilute the power of the dominant political group sufficiently to guarantee better living conditions for more people, fewer wars, and a time of relative peace and prosperity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outcome 2: He slips, slams his head on the gangway, and remains in a coma until after the meeting of peers. They never reach critical mass and are unable to sufficiently dilute the current power base. It continues in a mode of greed, conquest, and oppression. This leads to large scale wars, massive deaths, and a time of hardship and oppression for all. In desperation, some of the trodden-under open portals to hell and other places, releasing terrors upon the face of the world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outcome 3: A random thief kills the man while stealing his money. The man never arrives at the meeting with his peers. They never reach critical mass and are unable to sufficiently dilute the current power base. It continues in a mode of greed, conquest, and oppression. This leads to large scale wars, massive deaths, and a time of hardship and oppression for all. In desperation, some of the trodden-under open portals to hell and other places, releasing terrors upon the face of the world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outcome 4: A political assassin kills the man on the gangway and most of his compatriots before they can meet. The current power base continues in a mode of greed, conquest, and oppression. This quickly leads to large scale wars, massive deaths, and a time of hardship and oppression for all. In desperation, some of the trodden-under open portals to hell and other places, releasing terrors upon the face of the world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This gives three timelines where terrors are released and only one where things remain pleasant. By a simple intervention this can be balanced. Someone meets the man at the ship. This prevents him from falling and hitting his head. It also prevents the random killing. The political assassination can still occur, with the result of one dark and one light outcome. This was a ridiculously simple example, but hopefully, it illustrates the concept.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Keeping the Balance</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The hardest part of the keeping of the balance is standing by and watching atrocity. As a Temporal I tried to reduce suffering, improve the lot of all, and make the worlds safer places for my citizens. As the Balance Keeper there are many times where I must remain aloof, even as great horrors are visited upon a people.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I know of no way to explain the duality of being both a Temporal and the Keeper. Memories of both collide constantly. I remember lifting up and tearing down countless civilization on thousands of worlds throughout the history of the multi-verse, but I also remember being born, growing up, and being the Premiere of a small galactic empire as well. The Keeper is a distant and alien being, the premiere was a kind and ruthless woman, and I am some amalgamation of the two.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The odd thing is, this avatar could live until the end of everything because of the Hut. It is a self-sustaining entity, alive in its own way, and even more so now that Tyana has taken up residence in its central core. Those of us that are woven into the Hut benefit from the self-regenerative qualities of the device. To destroy us, the Hut must be destroyed. To destroy the Hut, we must be destroyed. It is a strange symbiosis that will force this avatar to balance the temporal's memories with those of the Keeper.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Temporals - Thoughts of the Keeper</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Temporals believe they are the center of the universe, yet they believe the "gods" control them. They are the center, they move about and shape the multi-verse through their actions, far more than the "gods" and far more than we three. If only they could understand their place and effect, they would be both better and more terrible than they already are.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Father Figures - Thoughts of a Temporal</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Insane One, this name, given by the Hive Queen, sums up the man nicely. He hides in the dark recesses of his tunnels, plotting for a world that never existed. He believes he can restore the golden age of his youth to the world through coercion and scheming.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The sad thing is, his golden age never existed. Kayara and Sharyl have told me of his youth. It was a good time, but it was no golden age. There was discontent, inequity, and nastiness at work in the fabric of it. That is the lesson of all governmental things. Everyone will never be happy at the same time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He coddled his daughter, restraining her movements, protecting her from every danger he could percieve. In the end, she fled, running blindly into the jaws of his worst enemy. Had he let her run on a longer leash, he might not have lost her, and she might have retained her sanity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I know there are good fathers out there. He wasn't one, my temporal one wasn't, but they have to exist. Perhaps I should speak of mine, before the memory fades completely. His actions shaped me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was born on Aristaleze Prime, in the time of the Alliance, to a poor family, living in one of the enclaves. My father was a data thief. He didn't like to be called that, but it was what he was. He expected we would follow in his profession as we grew older.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wish I could remember more of my mother. I think she was kind and loving and a good person, but those memories are clouded by her death when I was seven.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was on my way home from school when it started. A bright sharp fear rising rapidly to terror. I began to run, faster, faster, knowing I had to get home. In my haste I missed the pushed up piece of walkway and tripped, falling hard on my hands. I was up again and running, headless of the blood oozing from the scrapes left by rough concrete.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was almost there now, just a little further. A scream burst in my head as I shoved the door open with bloody palms. A sharp pain at my throat brought me to my knees.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Crawling, I scrabbled to the stairs and clawed my way up them. On the second floor I pulled myself up again and staggered down the hall toward my mom’s room. At the door I stopped. Blood was everywhere, leaking from the slash in her throat, pooling under her chair. A long knife lay on the floor beside her. Her sightless eyes burned into mine where I stood leaning against the door frame.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My father came up behind me then. "She was weak, too weak to survive in this life. Forget her, you are stronger than she was, forget the weak ones and move on. Go, rest now, I'll take care of this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I turned to argue, to say something in her defense, but the cold calculating look in his eyes stopped me. Instead I nodded numbly and shuffled off to my room. Later I headed downstairs for something to eat. As I approached the kitchen I could hear my father’s voice. "It’s taken care of. She can no longer reveal anything. I need a cleaning call tonight to get rid of the mess." There was a pause before he continued, "No, they won't talk. If they do, they will end the same as their mother."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Life had not been easy before, but now it was even harder. Father expected obedience and punished any infraction with a heavy hand on the belt. My sister Claire suffered the most because of her affinity for computers. Her life became school, practice at home, and helping father with his jobs. My brother Brian, always strong for his age, fit right in as backup muscle for father. I was left alone a bit more, considered to be useless for most activities.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">That changed again when I turned sixteen. A new form of security device had come on the market with some changes in various laws. The laws made it ok for security devices to kill data thieves. Somehow the data holders convinced enough people in control that the theft of data was at least as evil as murder. One of those new devices killed my sister, although, I'm still not certain she didn't make the mistake deliberately. Father's abuses increased through the years, and she saw most of it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her death put me square in the path of it from then on. I was expected to become the next security expert. It didn't come as easily to me, so there were several times I worked with cracked ribs, huge bruises, and once, a broken jaw.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I started to disappear, fading into a walking shadow, gaunt, pale, lifeless. Father pulled me out of school to continue my education, and because the local authority was starting to notice my condition. I took to slipping out whenever I could, slipping through the shadows of our city and even onto the university grounds. They would have put me in jail if they had caught me there, but it would have been better than home. It was illegal for any local to be on university grounds unless they had the security clearances and work permits that were required.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was a spot on university grounds that was right next to the river that became my favorite spot. I would spend hours there, lying in the sun and trying to forget. I met Sara there and she changed my life. There have been three people in my life that have helped me the most. Sara was the first of them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sara was warm, outgoing, friendly and we became friends almost immediately. She could have been my identical twin. We spent the summer together, at least as much as I could manage. She was the first person to convince me what my father was doing to me was wrong, constantly telling me it was wrong for people to hit me. I started to climb out of my near dead state thanks to her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I spent as much time as I could with her over the school break. By the end of the break I knew something had to change in my life. My chance came when father took a job far beyond his skills. It involved infiltration, data swapping, and high security bypasses in a data warehousing facility. I was supposed to crack the systems while he swapped the physical data stores. It went perfectly, until I deliberately tripped the alarms and trapped father and brother in the vaults, then triggered the off-site alarms on my way out of the building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slipping through the shadows to the university was the easy part. My plan was to borrow clothes from Sarah and escape from town with a work detail, then find a new city to settle down in. Once more life did not go as I had hoped, but that is a tale too painful to relate, especially after this one.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Hut</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It is hard to know what to say about the Hut. It is a miracle of majikal and technological engineering. Majikal energy ebbs and flows through it in tangible waves, like warm summer breezes and cold spring rains. When I'm not in it, the absence aches like old injuries. It calls to me in my sleep and comforts me in the waking hours. Even the Eternal is warmed by it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sometimes I will go to the Core Systems, the heart of the device, and sprawl on the floor, feeling the throbbing, rumbling purr of the systems that sustain it. Other times I will stand on the wind swept slopes of the high mountain caves that form part of Shandi's section of rooms. The Formal Gardens enfold me when I need a touch of ordered beauty and the throne is my special place. In the throne I see what the Hut sees and feel what it feels when the interface is active and attached to a section of real-space.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If it weren't for my companions, it would be so easy to become lost in myself and implode in the vast spaces of the Hut. Even the Eternal feels the pull, the urge to step away and just forget that anything else exists. That's where friends and others come to your aid. They can remind you of conflicts, thoughts, and emotions that would otherwise slip away, leaving only emptiness behind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Eternal has come to understand the terrible dangers of absolute harmony. It seduces you into letting go of everything and sliding into total inaction. After a time, it is easy to slip into an apathy and relaxation so deep that everything is forgotten, including the things necessary to live. Even if my sister Powers and I could remove the conflicts of the multi-verse, we wouldn't, for in the doing, we would doom everything. It is harsh and hateful to the Temporal I was to understand that the tensions, conflicts, and dangers of life are necessary to sustain the multitude of life.</p>
