<p class="pagecaption">Lab Diary 2</p>
<p class="regtxt5">8 Cenetash 6700 (maybe) - I don't know how I survived. Everyone else in the lab is dead. The city is dead. My family is dead. I only pray my sister, Dorotea, is still alive somewhere.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">9 Cenetash 6700 (?) - I found prison cells. Some of the prisoners are alive and tell tales of horrible experiments done on them by other research groups. I have freed them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">10 Cenetash 6700 (?) - I have placed the artifact back into the Vault, along with all but one set of keys. The last set I have hidden in case my child or I have need of them sometime in the future.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">7 months later - my child was born healthy with no apparent mutation from the magical energies that laid waste to Mirishtahan, my city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">2 years after the war - twelve Wizard Lords now rule the lands, each in their various holdings. They seek the old items of power, the ones used in the wars. A retainer came here, looking for artifacts. We killed him after learning of his task.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">5 years after the war - Tomanas took me to a section of Dwarven tunnels he had found after the last earth shake. He wanted to know what the strange globe was, but I had no idea.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">6 years after the war - A Wizard Lord has come himself to search the city. He cannot be allowed to succeed. As I am the only one with enough training to oppose him, I am leaving to take care of this. Signed Tonie Ayrthane, last of the Mirishtahan Sisterhood of Research.</p>
