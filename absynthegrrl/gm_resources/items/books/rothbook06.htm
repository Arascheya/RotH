<p class="pagecaption">The Ways of Gods and Powers</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At first I was going to place all the information in this one volume. Then I realized it would be easier in several. Ask Koria, the librarian, and she will get the various volumes for you. She has a rule that no books may leave the Hut and she is quite strict on enforcing this, particularly with the sensitive inter-planar items like my notes.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Old Ones</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This term is mistakenly used for older gods of various worlds. In truth, there are only two Old Ones. These are the Creator and the Destructor. They split from the primal force at the dawn of the current universal age. The Creator is the creative force that balances the destructive force of the Destructor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the start of this age the Creator and the Destructor were in balance, each one understanding the importance of the other and of a balance between their effects.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the age progressed each one sought more and more to achieve supremacy in view point. As time went along and various intelligent beings were created and evolved they would attempt to use these for proxy wars.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At last a group of younger gods fought each of these primal powers to a standstill and imprisoned them outside the flow of time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Creator struggles to free itself and create a new group of followers. This time the goal is the destruction of the younger ones and any of their allied creatures. Then it seeks to overwhelm and destroy the Destructor. The Destructor seeks to destroy the Creator and any others that oppose it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The exact whereabouts of the Elder Sign sealed gateways to the Creator and Destructor are not known.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Neither The Creator nor The Destructor realizes that the destruction of the other will doom them both and bring on the next age of the universe. If they are released from imprisonment they will immediately seek each other out and attempt to destroy the other. This will end the multiverse and trigger a new creation.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Younger Gods - The Greater Powers</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These were created by the two Elder Gods as servants. They were content in this role until the Elder Gods began to fight both directly and through proxies. These battles began to threaten the very fabric of space and time so the Younger Gods combined their powers and imprisoned the Creator and the Destructor outside the flow of time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Younger Gods exist as a triad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One face is the face of matter, order, and form. She is known as the She Who Must Never Be Named and she controls the city at the center of forever, Centrys, also known as City at the Center, City of Gates, City of She... This is the anchor point for the material forms of the multiverse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The second face is the face of the void, emptiness, unfulfilled potential, and formlessness. She drifts through the dark places of the universe and contemplates the raw forces of energy and entropy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The third face is the Great Mother, the one who balances between form and formlessness. This is the face that creates races, brings change to stagnant systems and order to chaotic systems. As part of her chaos she will periodically incarnate into a member of one of the sentient races and observe from within. She also uses this tactic to bring stability or chaos as required.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These three are considered the Great Powers. From them all others are derived. In their images are the gods and goddesses of the sentient creatures created. Deep within the psyches of all sentients is a tiny kernel that came from these Powers at their creations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Greater Powers exist across all time streams. There is only one of each and they are unkillable by any normal means. There are only two ways to end them:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">1) they can meet together and unmake themselves, returning to the energy pool that is the multiverse.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">2) they will end if the Creator and Destructor ever meet.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Proxy Gods - The Lesser Powers</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is the way the Greater Powers - the Younger Gods - refer to the various deities, demi-gods, godlings and such of the sentient races.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is much speculation about the origins of the proxy gods. Some believe they are the coalescing of the religious energies of the race(s) that worship them. In this view the more worshippers feeding energy to the god, the more powerful it is. Others believe they are unintentional fragments from the Greater Powers that broke off during the binding of the Creator and Destructor. Still others believe they are their own entities, formed as a result of the creation of the universe.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The manner of their creation is not important to understanding their role in the multi-verse. Most of them are vain, self centered and interested only in their own glorification. They see the beings worshipping them as ready tools to promote their greatness to the rest of the multi-verse. Typical proxy gods care nothing for the non-sentient life forms nor for the inanimate items of truth, beauty, and art that the sentient races create as part of their life cycles. Their only interest is in gathering as many followers as possible and inspiring these followers to convert or destroy any that do not worship them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are a few exceptions in behavior. Nature gods and goddesses tend to take a more balanced view of the whole situation, only entering into the fray when necessary. There are also a few older Proxy Gods that have risen above the petty squabbles of the majority.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On some level the Proxy Gods know the Greater Powers can kick their asses, but they also know that as long as the multi-versal balance doesn't get too far out of alignment, the Greater Powers will probably not interfere.</p>
