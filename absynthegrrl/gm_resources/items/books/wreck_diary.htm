<p class="regtxt5">...left .... headed for K.....l, straight through the darkest part of the void. We are carrying 1 million people for colonization. Our world is dying from Razak treachery. Others have left in other ships. The entire Alliance of Planets has been attacked with the deadly grey gas.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have entered a strange electro-magnetic disturbance. Nav systems are returning suspect data. We are flying almost blind through this thing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have successfully passed through the anomaly. Some sensitive systems show extensive damage.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The new world is beautiful! The only star visible is the central one. We are in the void between the galactic arms. No single stars are visible, just the faint glowing bands of the arms.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We thought this world was pristine, yet there are some signs of previous inhabitants. The strangest is a large stone platform with a blue seven pointed star inscribed into a tile in the very center of it. This is the location the council has declared the center of the new world.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It has been decided to return for more survivors. Those we could not put in Thermionic Suspension or take on the ships were sealed in protective areas. We also need to return to get refreshed versions of our data. The electro-magnetic anomaly destroyed all the computer records we brought with us.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We emerged into a Razak patrol. We destroyed them all, hopefully before they could send data back to their fleet. The other ship was damaged so badly it has had to return to Ka.....</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We continued on. This was a mistake. Our nav system was more severely damaged than was realized. The ship has exited hyperspace into the rock of a planet. I am alive but seriously injured. The First Elder is unconscious and alive. I do not know how serious his injuries are. I have opened the emergency exit and pulled him out. No one else on the bridge survived. I am alive but have no idea where I am...</p>
