<p class="pagecaption">Trilbarash School Notes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Notes from the School of Magic on Trilbarash at the Great Well of Worlds</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At first I was going to place all the information in this one volume. Then I realized it would be easier in several. Ask Koria, the librarian, and she will get the various volumes for you. She has a rule that no books may leave the Hut and she is quite strict on enforcing this, particularly with the sensitive inter-planar items like my notes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is one about Magical Theory. This one is notes from the School of Magic on Trilbarash at the Great Well of Worlds. These are some of the interesting ideas I heard as the Mistress of the School.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a volume on Gates. This volume deals with the concepts of Dimensional Gates and travels. Many of these notes are from Tesch Mar when he was studying at Trilbarash. I have not heard from Tesch Mar after he left the school so there is no way of knowing if he ever found any proof for his hypothesis.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have also included an additional concept proposed by Kaltereth ni Marasha. She was an ardent follower of Tesch Mar and his theories and hoped to expand on his understanding through her own researches. She was one of the few who sought me out that I deigned to speak with. She was an intelligent and thoughtful Arcane of great promise. After our first encounter we saw each other often.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Interestingly there was some type of techno locking device on the World Gates of the world where Kaltereth was conducting her studies. She didn't have the knowledge necessary to do much more than identify it as such.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My last communication from her said she was headed off with someone named Aztol. He was going to provide her access to other worlds and gates for additional research. I have heard nothing from her since. Should you come across my friend, please render her any assistance you may. I fear however that she is gone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Addendum: Aztol has come to ask me for information. When I asked about Kaltereth he said she was lost. He is an arrogant, sniveling worm of a man. More mad than anything with a twisted brilliance that has allowed him a following. Be wary of him for he is insane and without honor. He shall seek you once he learns you possess this device.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The third volume is the notes on the construction and operation of this device. It is an inter-dimensional construct powered by a hybrid of majik and Ancient Magic, that which was once known as "technology".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Your paths will likely cross the legends of The Hand. Great Mother, I hope you can find and stop this being. His use of the Hand and Eye of Azeloth threatens to bring things to an end. I have talked briefly with my acquaintance, She Who Must Never Be Named, and she has told me this being wields the powers of a long dead priest in the service of the Destructor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hand must be "killed" with the Sword of Lorsan, which will force him back to his stronghold. Then, before he can fully regenerate his form the Hand of Azeloth must be cut from his body. The Hand of Azeloth looks like a withered, fire blackened left hand and forearm when it is regenerating . This must be destroyed by soaking it in the tears of a cat eyed virgin in a lost holy relic of Ertan, known as the Bowl of Purity. She Who Must Never Be Named believes the Eye of Azeloth must be destroyed in a similar fashion, however she has no idea who might be wielding it at this time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Prophecies reveal the only way into the Hand's fortress is with the help of a pair of twins. The bond between them will bridge some type of distortion he has created around his fortress. Without these twins there is no way to gain entry without succumbing to his powers. I believe his fortress resides in Akhalt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have seen a reference, long ago, in a tome I have been unable to recover, that says one of the twins can be released from her curse by sprinkling her physical form with water in which the Hand and Eye of Azeloth have been dissolved.</p>
