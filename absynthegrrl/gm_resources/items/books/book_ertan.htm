<p class="regtxt5">At the beginning of the harvest season Ertan spoke to Zoam commanding him to construct a Vessel to be consecrated to Him and to hold the symbols of His blessings. "This Vessel shall be a sign of the blessings I have bestowed upon my Chosen People. You shall cause to be carved a Zerym flower from a perfect block of purple jade. It shall be carved in the form of a half opened Zerym blossom. The size of it shall be twice the length of your forearm in outer diameter and the height of your forearm on the outside. It shall be carved to perfection without mar or flaw. Into the center of it you shall fit a ruby center with gold parts coming forth from it. You shall attach to its base a stem of flawless green jade with three leaves, of one piece of jade shall you make the stem. You shall make for it a cover in the form of a dome of amaranthine wood and cover it within with purest platinum and without with purest gold.  On the dome shall be a perfectly formed serpent of the size and shape of the next one you see, rearing with the mouth of it open.  The fangs of it shall be of diamond, purest flawless white diamond, while the eyes of it must be of purest ruby.  The throat of it shall be hollow and extend down the body of it and through the dome lid. The diameter of the throat shall be the size of the thumb of your virgin daughter. The throat shall be closed at each end with purest diamond, exquisitely fit. The serpent shall be of purest gold and of one piece with the dome lid. The gold working of it must not enter inside the domed lid, nor may it touch the platinum of the inner covering, for if it shall My wrath shall be kindled against you. The edge of the dome, where it mates with the blossom, shall be finished with purple jade the thickness of a cured goat skin and fitted without flaw. From the moment of the consecration of this vessel it shall be known as the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You shall build a three sided pyramid of brass rods, the diameter of the wrist of your daughter with the upward point removed so as to support the Vessel. The rods shall be three forearms in length. When the Vessel is ready to put on the stand you shall carve three notches into it to accept the rods of the stand. The Vessel shall be positioned so that the three leaves face the three openings in the stand. From each of the three legs you shall fix copper spikes the length as that of your foot pointing towards the ground. You shall fix two thirds of the way down the three support rods a ring, on each, of purest brass, the outer diameter of which shall be twice the size of your closed hand, the inner diameter the size of one closed hand. Then shall you cover the brass parts with a layer of purest beaten gold.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Next shall you find two poles of amaranthine wood of four forearms in length and the diameter of the wrist of your daughter. These shall be of straightest grain and without blemish. These shall you cover in purest beaten platinum, leaving a space of wood at each end as handles.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You shall carve a bowl of ebony in the form of a lotus blossom. This bowl shall be in the perfect likeness of the lotus and its inside shall have the capacity of ten wineskins, made of the skins of goats without blemish. You shall build this bowl with rings of jade opposite each other in the form of egg shaped rings for the purpose of carrying this bowl. You shall soak the bowl in the purest of oil of olives for two xers. From the moment of the consecration of this bowl it shall be known as the Bowl of Purity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You shall, on the night of the Full of the Red Moon, take the completed Vessel and carry it into the midst of the fields of grain before harvest.  In like manner shall you take the bowl.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You shall the consecrate them to Me. You shall take half a wineskin of the milk of a mother who bore a son on the full of the blue moon, the water of birth from a woman giving birth on the full of the red moon, a wineskin of milk from the Araq-el-mora plant, and the juice of the Ankhara tree fermented and mix them in the Bowl of Purity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This shall be the order of the mixing. A virgin, recently accepted as a companion but not yet known by her mate, shall bathe and anoint herself with sweet smelling herbs and oils and go into the field in the midst of the night, letting none see her. She shall wear a robe of purest white wool and a scarf of purest virgin silk wrapped over her hair. She shall then remove all garments and prostrate herself before the Vessel. Then shall she take the waters of birth and rub them into the Bowl of Purity, taking and anointing her breasts and loins. Next shall she take the milk of the mother and pour it into the Bowl, again anointing her breasts and loins. Then shall she add the milk of the Araq-el-mora plant and the fermented Ankhara juice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She shall the wave then white silk over her head seven times to signal her companion to come to her. He shall have bathed and anointed himself and donned a towel of finest linen. He shall join his mate and they shall stand in My presence naked. She shall stir the Liquid in the Bowl with her left hand while stimulating her mate with her right hand until his seed shoots forth into the Bowl and until he is once more stimulated.  Then shall the silk be spread in front of the Bowl and he shall lay her upon it and go into her. The silk shall then be dipped seven times into the Bowl. They shall then fill the Vessel from the contents of the Bowl and anoint the place where the stem joins the blossom and then sleep near the Vessel and Bowl until morning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next morning they shall return to you after waving the silk three times. You shall not go near the Vessel until she who was virginal shall have stopped bleeding. Then shall she and her mate return with you, Zoam and your three sons. The One Who Was shall remove the dome from the Vessel and you and your eldest shall take up the poles and pour the Liquid in the Vessel into the Bowl of Purity. Then shall the mate of the One Who Was spread her thighs and remove from within her loins the Orbs of Law which I shall give unto you. The One Who Was must place the Orbs of Law into the Vessel of Blessed Orbs and she shall replace the dome. Only she or those specially consecrated to Me may remove the Orbs of Law and only after the Ritual of Opening and Bringing Forth has been performed. This ritual shall be known only to those specially consecrated.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You shall the take up the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs and the Bowl of Purity, still with the Liquid within it, and bear them back to your people.  Then shall the One Who Was show forth the Orbs of Law and all shall drink of the Liquid. All joyous and thankful impulses shall be followed by all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Each harvest, at the Full of the Red Moon, shall you follow this ceremony.  A virgin, recently accepted as companion but not yet fulfilled, shall bathe and be anointed by the priesthood of the Ones Who Were and dressed in a robe of purest white virgin wool and her hair bound in a pure white silk cloth.  She shall mix, in the midst of the night, one half skin milk of mothers and fermented Ankhara juice in the Bowl of Purity in the midst of the unharvested fields. Then shall she wave the silk seven times and her mate shall join her. They shall undress one another and she shall mix the Liquid with her left hand while stimulating her mate with her right until his seed shoots forth into the Bowl of Purity and until he is stimulated once more. Then shall he lay her upon the silk and go into her. The silk shall the be dipped into the Bowl of Purity seven times and the couple shall take up a handful of Liquid and place it into the mouth of the Serpent on the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs. Then shall they sleep till morning when they shall wave the silk three times and join you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Then shall the Bowl of Purity and the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs remain undisturbed until the One Who Was has stopped bleeding. Then shall the Liquid be drunk by all and the Orbs of Law shown by the priestesses and My people shall join in all forms of joyous impulse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And it came to pass that Zoam followed Ertan`s desires and the Vessel and Bowl were constructed. And it came to pass that on the Full of the Blue Moon Tara, eldest daughter of Zoam, gave birth to a child and her milk was saved. It also came to pass that Jolan, wife of the eldest son of Zoam, bore him a son and her waters were preserved. One the same day, the day before the Full of the Red Moon, Tery, virgin daughter of Zoam, chose Tobar as her companion and he her. They cleansed themselves and performed the consecration as directed and Tery became the first and high priestess of the Ones Who Were. It also came to pass that the Orbs of Law were found within the loins of Tery.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And these are the Orbs of Law which Ertan caused to be brought forth from within the loins of Tery:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">1) Ertan is the only supreme deity </p>

<p class="regtxt5">2) you shall not waste the vastness of the world, nor the treasures of it, nor the plants of it, nor the animals of it, nor anything which is of the world</p>

<p class="regtxt5">3) you shall not slay others of your kind</p>

<p class="regtxt5">4) you shall not allow the envy of others to poison your spirit</p>

<p class="regtxt5">5) you shall not take from your neighbor that which is his or that which he needs more than you</p>

<p class="regtxt5">6) you shall strive to maintain peace and harmony amongst all people and in all things.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The seventh Orb of Law came to be known as the Orb of Direction. It was given by Ertan to lead His people to a Chosen Land of Paradise.  We, the Chosen of Ertan, journeyed far to find the Paradise.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">break in underlined text</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And Ertan caused to grow in Paradise great trees which contained rooms and dwellings and platforms. He made for us all manner of fruits and animals in abundant forms to help us and provide us with food. In the midst of the Trees of Habitation he caused to grow a tree containing an inner and an outer room, within the inner room was kept the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs and within the outer was kept the Bowl of Purity. And Ertan appeared to Tery in a dream and instructed her in the Ritual of Opening and Bringing Forth and from that day only the priesthood of the Ones Who Were could bring forth the Orbs of Law. Tery was instructed to perform this ritual on the Full of the Red Moon during harvest and that all were to partake of the Liquid and receive the Blessings of Ertan.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">break</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After the Chosen had dwelt in Paradise some began to fall by the wayside.  One of these, Aldacron, sunk so far from the Glory of Ertan that he attempted to take the Orbs of Law for himself.  When he touched the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs his hands were burnt black and fell from his arms like leaves from trees.  He fled taking with him others who had listened to his evil words.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And it came to pass that the fallen began to build a city upon the plains outside the forest of the Trees of Habitation.  They began to build their city of stone and dead trees and grasses.  They built on the plain before the lone mountain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Generations passed and the Damagers, as the fallen had come to be called, continued to tear up the plains and cover it over with rock and decay.  They began to call up the old evil powers buried within the world. Great grew their pride and their hatred of those still living in Paradise under the Glory of Ertan. And their folly grew great and they began to damage the area near the Blessed Lands of Ertan and Ertan magnified their foolishness and caused them to abduct Lyneiya, High Priestess of the Ones Who Were, and several of her acolytes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And Ertan permitted the Damagers to take His Priestesses into their city and then His wrath rose up against them.  Ertan lifted up His Chosen people and protected them from the wrath He rained on the Damagers.  How long His wrath continued is not known but when His Chosen once again walked the paths of the world they were in a strange place.  The entire form of the world had changed.  When the Chosen were once again on the world, Lyneiya was returned to them and told them only this concerning what she had witnessed, the rest Ertan had blessedly removed from her memory.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lyneiya speaking to the Chosen, "When I woke I was tied to a block of cold stone in front of which was the Bowl of Purity, beside which was the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs.  I saw the others stripped, bloody and laying senseless on the stones of the floor.  As I watched I beheld a naked man cut the throat of one of my sisters and smear the blood on himself.  That which was left over he poured into the Bowl of Purity.  Likewise did he unto the others.  And as he did so he began to chant a strange and evil sounding chant.  The torches began to dim and a great evil presence began to gather behind the alter.  As it began to form into a vague man shape the man with the knife started to carve arcane symbols into my bosom.  When he began this the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs gave forth a beam of blinding light from the eyes of the Serpent and it caused the man to fall dead.  Then the beam hit the evil and it screamed in rage and threw clods of darkness.  The glory of Ertan then lifted me up and bore me back to you that I might continue the order of the Ones Who Were.  He has taken my sisters to dwell with Him in the wilds of paradise.  He has instructed me in rituals to perform now that the Holy Items have been placed as guardians of our safety and peace.  And Ertan spoke to me as He lifted me up in His glory, `Blessed are you for you have aided in the subduing of a great Evil. Blessed shall be you and yours through all time for I shall give you a new home and you and yours shall travel far, spreading to many lands.  Your offspring shall be My priestesses for all times and shall always carry within them knowledge of Me.  But take care lest you should fall for I shall not hesitate to cleanse this world again should great Evils arise once more.  Only the true and pure will survive.  Remember and set down for all men My Laws and teachings that your days shall be long and your ways true.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Every harvest shall you perform this ritual: You shall take a virgin offspring of the Chosen People and bind her to a table of darkest oak. You shall mix the colors of red flowers with wine and ground wheat and make a paste of the consistency of blood. You shall contain it in a bowl of clay mixed with goats blood, from a goat without blemish. In the middle of the night of the Full of the Red Moon you shall break the bowl and release the girl who must lay with the first man she sees.  She must allow him to go into her and know her and live with him for the next eighty five xers as his concubine/slave even as you must do this upon your return to the Chosen People. After this she may stay with him as companion or slave, or she may join the priesthood, or she must wait three harvests and become a free woman again. The first girl child of this union shall become a priestess if her mother does not. This shall insure the continuation of the order.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And so upon completion of her narration Lyneiya went forth and lay with Zatol, the first man she had seen upon her return and she bore him a son. She continued to enjoy the company of Zatol even after returning to the priesthood and bore him ten more sons and six daughters who went into the priesthood.</p>
