<p class="pagecaption">Witchbane Rounds</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The gun is the great equalizer. A weak man may defeat a strong one thanks to the gun in his hand. A woman might turn the tables on a rapist, a child can slay a demonic tormentor. Black Tokyo’s witchhunters and demon slayers have turned to a combination of high tech, full auto fire power and ancient rituals to survive and triumph.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Witchbane Rounds are conventional high caliber rounds, anointed with mind-crushing oils, holy water and wine, and blessed by hardliner priests of a dozen faiths.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In addition to suffering normal damage for the weapon it is fired from, if a spell caster is injured by a Witchbane round, he or she must succeed at a WILL save (DC 12 + ½ the damage inflicted), or lose 1d4+1 spell levels worth of prepared spells, starting with the lowest level the magic user can cast.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For example, if a oni-cursed acolyte is shot with Witchbane Rounds, she initially loses 1d4+1 levels worth of first level spells. When she ‘runs out’ of first level spells, she begins losing 2nd level spells, and so on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If shot by a gunslinger who has feats that allow the shooter to deal additional dice of damage on a successful hit (such as Burst Fire or Double Tap), the WILL save DC increases by +2 for every additional die of damage inflicted, representing more Witchbane Rounds hitting the target and delivering their anti-magical toxins into the victim’s body.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The purchase DC and construction times given are for a clip of 13 Witchbane Rounds. Once a Witchbane Round is fired, even if it misses its
target, it is destroyed and the magic dissipates. Any conventional ammunition can be enchanted to become Witchbane Rounds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Belt fed ammunition may be enchanted, but each conjuration only enchants 13 of the bullets, which means encircling a full ammo belt is a difficult, mentally taxing and expensive process.</p>
