<p class="regtxt5">A ceremonial dagger, the hilt is shaped as a black panther with green emerald eyes.  When this dagger is used to kill a victim the Priest doing the killing gains all the knowledge and spells that the victim knows.  There is a 50% chance of insanity.  Or the dagger maybe used in a ceremonial sacrifice to Kala in which case the Goddess gets the knowledge, spells and POW.  Anyone killed with this dagger can never be resurrected.  They are permanently and irrevocably dead.  (This dagger is not used often and when it is used the victim is carefully selected.)  This artifact has a POW of 20.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A strangling cord of grey mist with two black panther head handles.  As long as a fumble is not rolled it will always hit.  It does and additional 7 points of damage to the victim.  This artifact has a POW of 19.  Anyone less that an initiate of the cult touching this artifact will go immediately to the Goddess, forever.</p>
