<p class="regtxt5">Storm Child: A bow of ebony that shoots 6d6 lightning bolts when no arrow is put in the string.  If an arrow is used it doubles the damage and range of a normal elf-bow.  Once per week this bow will give an arrow, shot out of it, the properties of an arrow of slaying 2 pts of power are needed to activate this aspect.  This bow has an INT of 18, and a POW of 20.  The lightning bolts use one point of the bow's power each bolt.  Mara will be most upset if the bow's power is reduced to 0.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Nature Child: A circlet of silver and gold leaves with a green stone in the center.  This artifact gives the high priest of the Nature Child cult the ability to call and control all animals and plants in a ten zeem radius.  Usable once every five weeks, control lasts until the need is over.  Usually only used to protect the forests and temples of the Nature Child.  This circlet also allows the calling of the entire Mara cult, Nature and Storm Child alike.  The circlet's POW is 18.</p>
