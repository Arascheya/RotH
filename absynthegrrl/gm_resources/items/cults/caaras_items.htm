<p class="regtxt5">A small round river rock the size of a dime, it is red with white veins.  When placed in a river it fills with 100 gallons of water.  It will still weigh the same as when it was empty.  When placed in a water skin or bowl it will keep the container full of water until the 100 gallons are used up.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Caaras gave this to his followers so that they may cross waterless terrains without their mounts being unduly discomforted.  Unless there is a serious problem this water is for the mounts only.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A bronze ring that has a thin band of some crystal inlaid around it.  This ring holds all the spells, both Battle and Rune, of Rune Lords and Rune Priests whose death was expected.  These spells are one use only, and only a Rune type may use it.  If all Rune types are lost then the ring will teach spells to Lays and Initiates until a Rune type can come to lead the tribe or until an Initiate qualifies.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This ring teleports from tribe to tribe going where it is needed.  When the need is over it teleports to the next tribe, if there is no pressing need it will stay with the current tribe and will teach one Rune type a Rune spell the tribe does not have.</p>
