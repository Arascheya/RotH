<p class="regtxt5">A Head Band of silver with three sea gems set in it.  This artifact is exceedingly powerful as it allows the attuned priest to control all forms of water in a 10 zeem radius.  As in freeze it, boil it, or vaporize it.  No one knows the extent of the powers of this artifact.  After employing the powers of this artifact the wielder looses 1d6+4 temporary power points.  However if a priest employs the full extent of the powers there is a 75% chance that he will be called to Shasu's home to be with the god forever.  The POW of this artifact is 19.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Ring is also of silver but with only one sea gem set in it.  The ring will allow the user to control the weather over the oceans and seas, as a Control Weather spell.  If used with The Head Band there is a 25% chance of calling a rain storm, or dispersing a rain storm over land.  This artifact has a POW of 18 if it is being attuned with the head band their POW is 20.</p>
