<p class="regtxt5">Earrings are two reproductions of the moons in their dark phase.  When attuned and worn by the High Priest/Priestess of the cult, they act as permanent power storage devices.  Each will hold up to 3 points of power.  Thus when both are full it will effectively give the wearer 6 points more power for defense and offensive spells.  It is also usable to buy high powered rune spells that other wise would be unattainable and still be able to keep a rune priest standing in the cult.  Each earring has a POW of 16, when both are being attuned at the same time their POW is 17.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The ring is a reproduction of the blue and red moons in the full phase,  The moons are set in Eagle's claws, made of silver.  When attuned and worn the wearer can cast a Free Ghost at twice the power of normal Free Ghost spell.  If worn with the earrings the wearer can totally destroy undead (up to and including Nazguls) with a single touch, once per week.  The ring has a POW of 17 if being attuned with one earring then their POW is 18 if the entire set is being attuned at once the POW is 19.</p>
