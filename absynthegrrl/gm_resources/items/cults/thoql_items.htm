<p class="regtxt5">Two magical torches, handles made of white gold, one head is of a blue/green crystal, the other head is of black crystal.  When a point of power is put into the blue/green one all magic in a 100m range glows either green for cult magic, or blue for arcane magic.  When a point of power is put into the black one any magical item or creature with in a 100m range that has been made or tainted by demons glows black.  Only Thoql cult members can see the magical items or creatures glow.  The stronger the glow the more powerful or tainted.  These torches cut threw any masking magic, and masking magic shows as a slight pink aura around the masked item or being.  The torches each have a POW of 14, to attune both at the same time their effective POW is 15.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A metal tiara that looks like worn parchment or leather.  Only the High Priest of the entire cult may use this, with the sacrifice of a permanent power point the priest will know if any cult member knows the answer to the question asked or which library and where in that library the answer to the question is.  The POW of this item is 18, even if being attuned with either of the two torches the effective POW is still 18.</p>
