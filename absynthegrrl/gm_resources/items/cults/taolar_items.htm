<p class="regtxt5">A wide leather belt, with antler bone clasp.  This belt has 30 small pockets 3" by 3" by .5" in size.  Anything in these pockets will transfer with a Were into wereform and back, even if the item is metal.  This allows the High Rune Lord to take metal with him as he travels.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A large rainbow crystal that the Shape Shift spell and crystal comes from.  This artifact will teleport to the temple it is needed, and once it has been used it returns to Taolar.</p>
