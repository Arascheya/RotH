<p class="regtxt5">A unicorn head necklace on a silver chain.  It is a spell multiplier, for Battle Magic spells it multiplies by 4, for Rune spells it multiplies by 2.  If one Blade Sharp 1 is put in 4 Blade Sharp 1s are put out, if 2 Blade Sharp 4s are put in then 8 Blade Sharp 4s are gotten out.  However the Rune Priest must know Blade Sharp 4 twice for this to work.  It works the same for Rune spells, as long as the Rune Priest knows the spells or is in Mind Link with someone that knows the spells.  This item has a POW of 17.</p>
