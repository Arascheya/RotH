<p class="regtxt5">Bard: This book bound in an unidentifiable metal on one side and unidentifiable  leather on the other.  The metal side details the making and playing of all the musical instruments ever known to the cult.  The leather side has copies of all the music ever composed and played by the cult.  POW is 18 and is only usable by Yimara Bards.  This book works similar to the Alchemy tome.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Courtesan: A book bound in purple silk, even the pages are silk.  This book contains a listing and explanation of all the pleasures in the world.  It also contains spells and songs for the relieving of mental anguish.  POW is 19, usable by Yimara courtesans only.  It works similar to the Alchemy tome in that the attuned person need only think of what the problem is and it will open to the right section.  Where this book is kept is a cult secret.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Alchemy: A book bound in Flat Black Metal, with an uncountable number of pages.  This book has all chemical formulas and magical formulas for potions of any sort.  It takes 2d6 weeks to find what is needed if the book is not attuned.  If it is attuned the owner has to hold the book, close his eyes, think of the category or specific formula he wants and open the book before he opens his eyes.  The book will open to the needed section.  It is impossible to mark this book for easy reference.  POW is 18.  This book has been lost for untold years, and can only be used by a Yimara Alchemist.  It appears valueless except for the Flat Black Metal to all non Yimaras.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Brewers: A book bound in an unidentifiable leather with metal reinforcements.  This book has only three pages, but when the attuned person wants a recipe for a particular brewed beverage the book will give 1-3 recipes.  A cost of temporary power of one point for each recipe is exacted for this service.  There is also the limits of a cult member needs to know the recipe in the first place, and a sample of the desired beverage has to be rubbed on to the cover plate of the book.  The recipes will stay for 1 hour at which time they will fade.  This book was lost during the last Dark Times uprising.  Only Yimara cultist specializing in brewing can attune this book.
