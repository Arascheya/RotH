<p class="pagecaption">Torque of Moans</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By buckling this gold and ivory torque around your throat, you lose you ability to speak, though you no longer truly need your voice for anything other than soft moans of pleasure. The Torque is a heavy golden collar with a stylized vaginal motif. At the center of the metallic vulva, an ivory rune stone presses tightly against the wearer’s larynx.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Torque’s wearer loses the ability to speak or cast any spells with verbal components while wearing the collar. Once per hour, the wearer may utter a sound of utter ecstasy, which can disarm and amaze.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Any sentient creature within a 30 ft radius of the Torque must succeed at a DC 16 WILL save or be rendered helpless for a round due to the overwhelming ecstasy they feel. For 1d4 rounds afterward, creatures overcome by the orgasmic sound are considered sickened, as they struggle to gain control over their bodies and emotions.</p>
