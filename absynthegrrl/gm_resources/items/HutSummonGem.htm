<p class="pagecaption">Hut Summoning Gem</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Star sapphire about 2 inches long by 1 inch wide, by 1/2 inch thick shaped in an intricate multi-faceted pattern.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These gems send a locating pulse to the hut when exposed to sunlight or having a Continual Light(Light(5) in NWN) spell cast on it. They will alert the hut from anywhere and allow the Mistress to direct the hut to their location if desired. Residents of the Hut will hear a deep resonant chord of bells tolling as the locator pulse fires off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a second form of Summong Gem that has <a href="../info/trcrystal.htm">Thought Crystal</a> imbedded in it. This gives the crystal a faint flickering reddish flame in the center of it. This allows the owner of the gem to communicate with the <a href="../../hut_online/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a> over any distance, from almost any place in the <a href="../info/multiverse.htm">multi-verse</a>. The gem will attune itself to the first person to touch it and only function for them. The Hut Controller can get full visual data from the gem owner if the controller is sitting in the Hut Throne and concentrating on the link. This improves the chances of a successful jump to the location of the summoner.</p>
