<p class="pagecaption">Soul Eater</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Weapons Triad item 2</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Weapon Type: dagger</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Damage: 1d4+2 and Special</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Appearance: as image</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Int: 18 Pow: 18</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soul Eater functions in two ways depending upon usage. In the first use, during dark rituals, a life holding gem is attached to the horns. In this mode Soul Eater consumes the target and stores its life energies in the crystal. This is total consumption starting when the blade strikes a vital organ. For best results this should be the target's heart. The best life holding gems are the gems used by Star Powered Arcanes. The next best ones are pure thought crystal, the third are spirit binding ones.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The other mode for Soul Eater is to drain life levels in steps. This is the more common mode, occurring whenever it hits a target and there is no life holding gem attached. The first step is 1 Con point and 1 Power point, the next step is 2 Con and 2 Power, up to 9 Con and 9 Power, then it starts over again at 1. The Power and Constitution can be fed to its wielder to rejuvenate them. There is terrible risk with this however. For each point transferred the wielder feels the terror, pain, and thoughts of the victim. Each time this power is used the wielder risks madness. Resolve as a sanity check with 1d3 sanity points lost each time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soul Eater howls and shrieks like a soul in torment during combat. Consider this a serious detriment to moral for all near it, friend or foe alike.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Three times per day Soul Eater can spit alien acid blood for 3d10 points of damage with each spitting. It can also detect life and detect enemies using its own power, or power it has eaten that day. It will recover its own power at the regular rate. It also functions as a locator device for the Hut and it will teleport into its owner's hand if they are separated during combat, or if the owner wishes it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soul Eater hovers on the verge of madness from the number of times it has fed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soul Eater seeks to attune to its wielder as soon as it is first used. In this attunement it also seeks to take control of the wielder. This is resolved as a power + int vs power + int of the wielder. If it succeeds it will then seek to return to that which controls the Keepers of the Gates. In the current state of the multiverse this would be <a href="../npcs/thehand.htm">The Hand</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was created by <a href="../npcs/tzilrynor.htm">Tzilrynor</a> to copy the knowledge of the beings it touched into a storage gem so he could create a library of knowledge from the greatest Arcanes ever to have lived. It was forged in the depths of the Dwarven First Home, in the fires of the earth there at the borders between a rift of fire and a Hell Gate. Tzilrynor knows he is using a Gate to boost the heat and power in the forging process but he doesn't realize as he is doing so that he is also binding the weapon to Hell Gates. When creating Soul Eater Tzilrynor used the soul and blood of an alien, meteoric iron from the slopes of Gigabolt Mountain, a knife from She Who Must Never Be Named, a stolen bit of flesh from the Great Mother in a previous incarnation, a hair from the Crone of the Void, and cerebrospinal fluid from a Mind Flayer.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Its actual function is to rip the soul from the living being and consume it, pass it to its wielder, or lock it in a storage gem based on the will of the wielder.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soul Eater is required for opening new Hell Gates. It can also be used in one of the methods for closing <a href="../info/gateinfo.htm">Hell Gates</a>. Few know the rituals required to perform either of these tasks. The Guardians of the Hell Gates can track Soul Eater since it has tasted their essence.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soul Eater is a major artifact and should be treated as such. It is immune to acid and fire. It can only be destroyed by one of the Powers unmaking it in the same fires that forged it using their blood mixed with the blood of an alien queen and cerebrospinal fluid from a Mind Flayer.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Engraved on the blade and visible when it is consuming souls is:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">ahzkna thilikah inzaktormas</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I consume souls</p>

<!-- <p class="regtxt5">The second dagger, Soul Eater, shall contain the most horrific of the majiks in all the weapons of the Weapons Triad. Soul Eater shall consume the souls of those it strikes. Soul Eater shall contain the bound spirit of one of the High Elder’s allies from the seventh level of the Gardens of Laazar. This spirit will power its detect enemy and detect life spells and give it the ability to attune itself to its owner. Soul Eater will consume its target starting slowly and building through nine levels. Once the ninth level of eating has occurred it shall start again at the first feeding level. Soul Eater will be able to feed the eaten essence of its victims back to its wielder, should it be desired. This comes with a price of feeling the essence, thoughts, and emotions of the eaten. This power should be used sparingly. The spirit contained in Soul Eater risks madness as well from this effect. Lastly Soul Eater shall be able to spit the blood of its bound spirit three times each day.</p> -->
