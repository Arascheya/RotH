<p class="pagecaption">Gashapon Armada Bag</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Gashapon Armada Bag is a whimsical magical weapon, but is no less deadly a threat for its cartoony, seemingly fun exterior. A gashapon armada is created simply, by encircling a few handfuls of the miniature anime figures and 100 yen toys found in kid’s vending machines across Japan. Mystical oils are poured over a small bag of tiny statues, a quick and quiet ritual is spoken, and a specially constructed silk bag is sewn to hold the weapons.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When commanded to do so, the finger sized little warriors spring to life, flying unerringly to attack your enemies, steal unguarded baubles and trinkets and perform other minor magical tasks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As a standard action you may grab a handful of gashapon action figures from the armada bag and toss them at your adversaries. A handful of thrown gashapon leap unerringly at their target, automatically striking a single target and inflicting 1d4+1 points of damage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You may also ‘charge’ a specific gashapon with a single casting/use of any touch ranged spell or ability you possess, allowing the gashapon to deliver the effect. When used in this manner, the gashapon grants you a +5 equipment bonus on the touch attack roll, and may strike any adversary within 100 ft. If the attack roll fails, the spell is wasted without effect. Using a gashapon in this manner is a full round action which provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finally, you may unleash your magical toys to cast mage hand as a ?rst level mage. The amount of charges expended is based upon the weight of the object. A charge is required for each pound (or portion thereof) of weight to be moved.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A newly constructed gashapon armada bag has 50 charges, represented by fifty to a hundred tiny figurines, stored within.</p>
