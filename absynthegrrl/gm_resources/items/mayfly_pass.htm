<p class="pagecaption">Mayfly Pass</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An amethyst given to a potential <a href="../info/carnival.htm">Dark Carnival</a> Mayfly (new comer) if they are hesitant about running away with the <a href="../info/carnival.htm">Carnival</a>, but hesitant about remaining in their current location. It will glow and function as a tracking and calling device under the dominant moon of the world it is distributed on. It is distributed by <a href="../npcs/kayara.htm">Kayara</a> to those she feels will definitely end up running away to join.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The effect will typically be a low level suggestion to travel to a point where the <a href="../info/carnival.htm">Carnival</a> can arrive, without being noticed, and pick up the Mayfly. This usually requires a significant journey on the part of the Mayfly. The idea being, if they weren't ready to join when the <a href="../info/carnival.htm">Carnival</a> was in town, they need to prove a certain level of determination for it to return for them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The function of these was inspired by the <a href="HutSummonGem.htm">Hut Summoning Gems</a> used by <a href="../npcs/margla.htm">Margla</a> and <a href="../npcs/irena_k.htm">Irena</a>.</p>
