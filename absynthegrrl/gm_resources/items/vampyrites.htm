<p class="pagecaption">Vampyrites</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Vampyrism is caused by a nanotechnology, vampyrites, produced by the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a>, a now long-dead race. The vampyrites were designed as a self-replicating, self-spreading probe mechanism for sampling data from other races. They are blood/fluid born and require blood transfer to infect the target. Vampyrites are self replicating and through their bonding with the target biological they confer a type of immortality. They will maintain life at the "death" of the target, be it slow aging death or rapid death.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Unfortunately the vampyrites so radically alter the target organism that reliable data gathering is not possible. Another side-effect is the desire to spread the probes - this results in complete alteration of the target species, negating the effectiveness of the probes. This need to spread themselves is the strongest driving force for the goals of the infected.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is one "cure" for vampyrites, however it was not found by <a href="../npcs/iskandera.htm">Iskandera</a> during her travels. There is a <a href="../items/reducers.htm">Reducer Nanite</a> strain available on the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a> <a href="../places/drkzyrkth.htm">world</a>. These nanites will consume the vampyrites and then become inert. This will successfully remove vampyrism from the host if the host is young enough that life support can continue un-aided by the vampyrites.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A wandering Arcane, <a href="../npcs/iskandera.htm">Iskandera</a>, is the 0 Vector, having become infected by the vampyrites when visiting the homeworld.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">DEV Notes - need to clean these up</p>

<p class="regtxt5">need to clarify how these really work - do they confer the need for blood/bloodlust, or is it more an uncontrollable need to spread? they destroyed their creators, but what was the mechanism, something similar to Serenity's Pax gas, or something different? the mechanism of the probes is to keep the host alive to gather data and to spread itself - unfortunately the need to spread itself is the dominant one - which rendered these more trouble than benefit and when they got loose in the general populace...</p>
