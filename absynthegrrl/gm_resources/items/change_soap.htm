<p class="pagecaption">Perfection Change Soap</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As you bathe, your flesh changes. Cold water flows over your body, and you concentrate on a new face, a new race, even a new gender. You emerge from the bath a new human, scented with the oils of an ensorcelled soap.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Perfection Change Soap is a mildly scented milk-white liquid held within a small ceramic jar tied with cloth prayer strips. Each jar of Perfection Change Soap holds exactly enough liquid for two transformations; once into an alternate form, and a return to your original form.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To transform, you must bathe yourself thoroughly, using exactly half the soap in the jar. Once the bath is complete, your body physically changes to match your desired new form. You can change height and weight, gaining or losing upto 20% of your body mass, change race, alter facial features and bodily details, even alter your gender.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If using the Soap to imitate a specific person, you receive a +20 bonus on Disguise checks. This is a physical transformation, meaning that certain feats and class abilities will not work if you alter your gender. A woman cannot use this soap to change gender while pregnant. True Seeing and similar magic does not detect the magical change; in effect, your new form becomes your true form.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Though you do not gain any metamorphic abilities, you gain the shape changer sub-type for the duration of the transformation, the one minor clue to your transformed nature. You may remain in your new form indefinitely. You will only return to your true form if targeted by dispel magic, or if you bathe with the remaining soap.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If the jar of Soap is destroyed or lost, you must succeed at a DC 14 WILL save, or permanently lose 1 point of CON as you are locked into your new form. Success will result in a reversion to original form in 1d6+1 days. Once locked into your new form, even dispel magic cannot return you to your original form. Anyone attempting to use a second dose of Soap gains no benefit, but destroys the Soap.</p>
