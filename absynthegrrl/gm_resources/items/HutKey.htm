<p class="regtxt5">This key will fit all locks, regardless of size, type, or composition. It adds 30% to pick lock attempts and 25% to any trap disarms performed on said lock. It will also add 25% to attempts to disarm magical traps on locks. These functions are useable once each day.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once per day it will exude Jamis thorn poison. Paralyses instantly and then slowly kills over next 20 hours. If antidote administered within first 15 hours there is no permanent damage, after 15 hours all physical stats are reduced by 20% of their value each hour.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Allows automatic access to all sections of the hut. It will always remain with the Mistress of the hut and allows the Mistress to program hut functions. It will function as a universal translator as long as it is within 20 feet of the hut. It will allow the Mistress to call the hut to her if she is within 5 zeems(kilometers) of the hut. Beyond that distance it will give the direction of the hut from the current location of the Mistress.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Currently there is a second instance of this Key in the possession of the Hut Controller for the Second Triad. This instance allows linking of thoughts and data from the Primary Contoller to the Second Triad. Margla will use this periodically to send images and critical data to the Second Triad to ensure their survival.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Reveals and opens all secret doors and causes levitates to work.  It will automatically stay with the hut's designated controller at all times after it is found and the controller has been defined (see hut control systems description).  Allows controller to access and program hut special functions (room changes/additions, auto door opening, levitates, etc.).  Special concealed or locked doors cannot be programmed for anyone except designated controller.  Functions as universal translator as long as it is within the hut or within 20 feet of the hut.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This item is found on Margla's body in the Control Room - <a href="..\..\hut_gm\margla02.htm"> Control Room</a>.</p>
