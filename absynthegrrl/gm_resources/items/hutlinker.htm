<p class="regtxt5">Allows all characters carrying one to communicate and see what any of the group is seeing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Implementation: group must decide which owner is the eyes when this effect is used. The owner of the eyes one may disconnect at will. Communication may be accepted or rejected by each member of the group. These items will link all members of one Player Hut together. These will not allow sharing or communication with players from another Hut.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Allows summoning the Hut to the location of a holder. The more holders at the Target Point the better the chance of a successful jump and Nav-Sys data point import.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Allows character to store a "Way Point" for returning to the game after signing out. Typical action would be sign in, spawn in Hut, jump to current Way Point.</p>
