<p class="pagecaption">Linemaker’s Polymer</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Linemaker’s Polymer blends modern nano-technology with ancient Goetic secrets, forming a potent barrier against demons that even laymen can use effectively. Warding symbols are encoded on molecule sized engines, creating a vicious, mobile liquid which when spilled on the ground automatically shapes itself into a powerful mystic barrier.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Linemaker’s Polymer is contained within a slender plastic vial. By shattering the vial, and pouring out the liquid (a standard action) the user can create a potent mystical barrier. No outsider can approach within 30 ft of a warded area; those who approach within 60 ft must succeed at a DC 12 WILL save, or be affected as though by a bane spell cast by a 5th level caster.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alternatively, the polymer can be splashed on any single outsider as a ranged touch attack. Treat as a ranged weapon with a maximum range of 10 ft. A demon splashed with the liquid must succeed at a DC 18 WILL save or be paralyzed for 5 rounds.</p>
