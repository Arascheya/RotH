<p class="pagecaption">Power Linking Crystal</p>
<p class="regtxt5">12 sided die shaped pendant of green jade with gold chain.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It allows many people at one time to share power for purposes of accessing hut control systems and fighting spirits. The Hut Controller must be one of the people linked through this item for it to work. It relies on various majiks of the Hut to function properly and will not work beyond the perimeter fence.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For the purposes of the Madison game it will awaken the programmer parts of Thock and Heron, but not the Pete and Sean personalities.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Optional Sections - It requires one week per being to attune this item. I.e. for two people it would take two weeks. If all party members wanted to be able to assist the designated controller then it would take the number of weeks equal to the number of party members. This item is mentioned briefly in Margla's diaries.</p>
