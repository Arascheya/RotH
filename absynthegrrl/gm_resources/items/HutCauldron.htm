<p class="regtxt5">The cauldron is made of cast iron, intricately detailed. It has eys or garnet and teeth of ivory.
<p class="regtxt5">The cauldron will grow and transport up to four people as directed by the Whistle. It can shoot one 40' diameter fireball up to 200' from each eye once each day. It can physically attack under whistle command. The attack is a grapple first followed by a bite if the grapple is successful. The bite is resolved as a large bite on the bite table. The grapple and bite attacks are at 80% OB. The bite occurs the same round as a successful grapple as long as the foe is actually entangled in some manner. Can protect itself and its occupants once per day with a <a href="../info/screens.htm">6th order screen</a> under whistle control.  It must recharge within the hut before it can again generate its screen. Recharge takes 12 hours. Screen duration is 1 hour.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This item is found on a shelf near the stove in the Interface Room.</p>
