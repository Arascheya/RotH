<p class="pagecaption">Hell Coral Armor</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are rivers in hell, oceans, and seas. Lightless ocean trenches home to drowned souls and demonic predators that need no light to hunt. Dark coral reefs imprison the endlessly drowning souls of betrayers and rapists: souls that one day might evolve into another demonic atrocity. The Onis of the Black Else craft the dark coral that grows in their realm as easily as they twist flesh and spirit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hell Coral is a living thing, a demonic symbiote which anchors itself to its host body, hiding within the host’s bone marrow when not needed. When extruded, the coral armor grows over the host’s nude body like a burgundy and black cancer. Gnarled coral nodules and random spines jut through the host’s skin. Deadly bone pincers grow over the host’s hands, transforming humanoid into an unholy crab thing, and a thick carapace covers the host’s face. Even though the host loses his human senses, he can still some how see and breath through the dark armor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While wearing the heavy, dense Hell Coral Armor, the host receives a +14 natural armor bonus to Defense, but cannot bene?t from a DEX bonus to Defense, and suffers a -8 armor check penalty. Due to the armor’s aquatic nature, its host does not suffer any penalty on Swim checks while wearing the dark coral armor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hell Coral Armor’s vicious pincers grant the host a natural attack which does 2d6 points of slashing damage which threatens a critical hit on a natural 20; the host is always considered proficient with this natural weapon. The pincers grant the host the Improved Grap and Constrict feats, allowing him to deal automatic damage each round a grapple is maintained. While wearing the armor, the host cannot use his hands for anything other than combat: he cannot hold or manipulate objects, cast spells, use weapons or climb.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hell Coral Armor grants it’s wearer tremorsense within a 60 ft radius, as well as a burrow speed of 20 ft. While the armor is active, the wearer can survive indefinitely under water. All together, the armor transforms its wearer into a demonic ambush predator.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">However, the Hell Coral Armor demands much of its host. Bonding to a suit of Hell Coral armor requires at least 8 hours of uninterrupted contact with the demonic carapace. Once bonded, each day of the symbiosis, the Hell Coral Armor drains a single point from the wearer’s CON and WIS scores, semi-permanently reducing those attributes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If the armor’s wearer does not use his pincers to deliver a coup de gras on a sentient creature with a CR equal to his own HD/total character level at least once every month, the temporary ability drain increases to 1d3 points each of CON and WIS per day, until the wearer commits murder.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bond can only be broken by casting remove curse, and only than if the wearer is willing to give up the Hell Coral Armor’s power. If the armor is removed while the wearer is alive, the wearer must succeed at a FORT save (DC 10 + the number of months he wore the armor) or suffer 1d6 points of permanent CON and WIS drain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Extruding or retracting the armor is a full round action which provokes attacks of opportunity. It is also an intensely painful process, which renders the wearer shaken for 1d4+1 rounds after the transformation.</p>
