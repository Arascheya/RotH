<p class="pagecaption">Trickster's Ring</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is a <a href="ring_key.htm">Thought Crystal Ring</a> with added majikal capabilities. It was modified and enhanced by Hann the Builder (Artificer to the Gods). This ring gives the wearer the ability to see behind the veil, revealing past events or hidden information about a place, person, or thing. The closer the contact or the more familiar the target is, the more detailed the information the wearer receives. This item has an affinity for those of <a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">T'Sani</a> blood. One of its first actions on activation will be to reveal the method by which <a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">T'Sani</a> blood was introduced to the wearer's blood-line.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The ring can bring up a seventh order screen to protect the wearer in cases of dire emergency. This cannot be relied on as the ring somehow knows if the emergency is truly life shattering for the wearer. If the wearer tries to depend on this by boldly marching into extreme danger, the ring will just not protect them. Instead, it will allow the wearer to die and hope to move on to the next suitable wearer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The ring will begin to work on its wearer to get them to seek out the <a href="../info/carnival.htm">Dark Carnival</a> and others of <a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">T'Sani</a> blood. The <a href="../info/carnival.htm">Carnival</a> will welcome the wearer regardless of level of T'Sani blood, but other <a href="../eritsani_inx.htm">T'Sani</a> will only welcome the wearer if he or she is a pure blood.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Ring is fickle. Sometimes it just won't work at all. Sometimes it seems to have a critical need detector, the more pressing the need, the less information is provided. Other times it works flawlessly. In DM terms the goal is to remind the players they can't rely on this ring as a cure-all to their information needs.</p>
