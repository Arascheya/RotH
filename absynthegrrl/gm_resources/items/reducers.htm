<p class="regtxt5">These were developed by the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a> to destroy problem nanites they may have developed. They are broad spectrum with regards to <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a> designed units. Their effectiveness on tech from other races is not known.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Currently the only source for these is on the dead <a href="../places/drkzyrkth.htm">home world</a> of the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a> race. This is located somewhere in the Cluster 1 sub-galaxy near the Zeltropian galaxy.</p>
