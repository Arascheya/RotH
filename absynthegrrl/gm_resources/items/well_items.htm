<p class="regtxt5">The Sacred Card</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A thin metalic card with SCX-STN-1036 CLS-FEA01 lettered on it. This is an ID card for opening the access doors and dropping the laser grid.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Controller</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A bulky backpack Containing an enclosed suite of electronics. There is a multi-pin connector on the right side of the pack. The backpack requires two hyperdrive control crystals to function. This device will theoretically allow control of destinations when moving through the Well (<a href="../gates_inx.htm">World Gate</a>). This device will always force a return to the Well if triggered in another Realm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Control Panel</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A cable attaches to this and runs to an arm mounted control pad. The pad is also rather bulky with a keyboard and small display set into it. It provides information on the Well field strength, destination code (an arbitrary system started by the researchers), a crude attempot at a translator program (40% able to translate any language), a keypad to enter out-bound destination and notes, and status of the backpack control unit and power system.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fragments - torn from a book or diary of some form</p>

<p class="regtxt9">These pages are very old, brittle, and fragile. The <a href="../info/prophecies/raus_frags.htm">text</a> has been translated by someone and transcribed onto slightly newer materials. These translations are found with the originals.</p>
