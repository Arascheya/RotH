<p class="pagecaption">Amaterasu’s Ribbon</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This silk ribbon is as colorful and glorious as a sunrise over Mt Fuji. The red cloth is decorated with golden threads, depicting the rays of the morning sun. Worn tight across a woman’s breasts, the cloth seems to pulse with stored power and an intense warmth. Most women sweat profusely while wearing the cloth, even while walking through Japan’s frozen forests.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Amaterasu’s Ribbon is an item of potent elemental magic. Named for the goddess of the sun, the Ribbon warms the body and strengthens the soul. While wearing the Ribbon, a woman becomes completely immune to environmental heat and cold, and suffers only ½ damage (rounded down) from fire or cold based attacks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once per day, the wearer can call forth her heavenly light, casting a searing light spell as if cast by a 5th level acolyte.</p>
