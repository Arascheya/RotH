<p class="regtxt5">Cold Winds Skirt</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the Kurils, there are supposedly secretive, reclusive clans of weavers so skilled they can catch the North Wind itself in their looms, weaving the fury and the strength of the wind kamikaze into their cloth. A handful of creation-mages have stolen their secrets.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A Cold Winds Skirt can be an off the rack school uniform, plain navy pleated cloth seemingly not worth 2000 yen. A Cold Winds Skirt might be all high fashion and seduction, wonderfully tailored silk and cotton, leather or denim. The appearance doesn’t matter,  just the skill with which the Skirt was woven.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A woman wearing a Cold Winds Skirt can call upon the wind to buoy her, allowing her to perform incredible feats of acrobatics. The skirt continuously grants the woman a +20 bonus on her Jump checks, and eliminates the maximum jump distance limit. In addition, the skirt’s wearer receives a +8 bonus on FORT saves made to resist extreme environmental cold.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once per day, the Skirt’s wearer can call upon the skirt’s greatest magic. She gains a ?ight speed of 40 ft (good maneuverability). She can fly for up to 5 minutes per day.</p>
