<p class="pagecaption">Ship of Ishtar</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is an exquisitely modeled, miniature ship about two inches long. It glows with a faint cherry light, like the fading light of a rich red sunset. A faint aroma of jasmine flowers can be detected in its presence. It binds to the first person to touch it and will call to them to study it closely.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The ship will grow slowly in size, as the owner studies it, until it is about a meter and a third in length. More and more detail comes into focus as it grows. Tiny figures can be seen by the time it reaches full model size. They seem to move about if the owner looks away for a time and then looks back. Anyone in the area with the owner will also be able to examine the ship. The description below is from the original historical transcripts (story).</p>

<p class="regtxt9">It floated high on a base of curving waves cut from lapis lazuli and foam-crested with milky rock crystals. Its hull was of crystal, creamy and faintly luminous. Its prow was shaped like a slender scimitar, bent backward. Under the incurved tip was a cabin whose seaward sides were formed, galleon fashion, by the upward thrust of the bows. Where the hull drew up to form this cabin, a faint flush warmed and cloudy crystal; it deepened as the sides lifted; it gleamed at last with a radiance that turned the cabin into a rosy jewel.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In the center of the ship, taking up a third of its length, was a pit; down from the bow to its railed edge sloped a deck of ivory. The deck that sloped similarly from the stern was jet black. Another cabin rested there, larger than that at the bow, but squat and ebon. Both decks continued in wide platforms on each side of the pit. At the middle of the ship the ivory and black decks met with an odd suggestion of contending forces. They did not fade into each other. They ended there abruptly, edge to edge; hostile.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Out of the pit arose a rail mast: tapering and green as the core of an immense emerald. From its cross-sticks a wide sail stretched.. shimmering like silk spun from fire opals: from mast and yards fell stays of twisted dull gold.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Out from each side of the ship swept a single bank of seven great oars, their scarlet blades dipped deep within the pearl-crested lapis of the
waves.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This item is based on the story <a href="../../docs/GameTales/Ship_of_Ishtar.txt">Ship of Ishtar</a> by Abraham Merritt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Access to the ship requires the correct incantation or an item that is bound to it. This can be decided at the time the item is introduced to the campaign. The two combatants are the Creator and the Destructor. This is one of their attempts to break free.</p>
