<p class="pagecaption">Viper Tongue Mask</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Resembling the fearsome war masks worn by samurai when fully armored, this black wood and lacquer mask depicts a leering fanged grimace with a long red tongue licking at swollen lips the color of a bruised plum. The mask is designed to be worn with a samurai’s helmet as a faceguard, but can be worn separately.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A creature wearing a Viper Tongue Mask gains a strange natural weapon. The creature’s tongue protrudes through the wooden lips, merging with the wooden tongue. The creature’s tongue becomes a prehensile chainlike weapon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Tongue Whip can threaten adjacent enemies as well as possessing 10 ft reach. The Tongue Whip inflicts 1d4 points of slashing damage, and threatens a critical hit on a natural 19 or 20. The wearer is always considered proficient in the use of this strange weapon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Tongue Whip receives a +8 bonus on disarm, grapple and trip attempts; when grappling, the Whip uses the creature’s size modifier. If the wearer’s trip attempt fails, the wearer can dismiss the magical tongue in order to prevent a retaliatory trip attempt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If the Tongue is ever severed, the mask becomes useless for 24 hours, and the wearer loses the ability to speak for a similar period. The Tongue has Hardness 5 and 20 HP. While wielding the magical tongue, the wearer can taste things normally, and the tongue is nearly as sensitive as the wearer’s genitals.</p>
