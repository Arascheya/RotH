<p class="pagecaption">Hell Hand</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Calls down a Hell Strike - a combination of Fire, Electrical, Disruption, and Cold damage into an area surrounding the wielder. Only the wielder is immune to the damage. Friend and foe alike in the target area take full damage from this attack.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hell Hand siphons power from the user to drive the effects. Even the strongest arcane can survive only one use of this item in a given day. <a href="../npcs/margla.htm">Margla</a> received the Hell Hand in a shipment of treasure from a sycophant several decades prior to her release. She left it in the Armory rather than deal with it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If this item is wielded by someone linked to the Hut the energy drawn from the wielder will be restored by the Hut. Theoretically the wielder could fire the weapon repeatedly with no serious energy drain. In reality the energy flow is fast and intense enough that the wielder begins to heat up from the transfer of such large amounts of energy. After several rapid firings the wielder will begin to cook from the inside out from the residual heat building up from this transfer. <a href="../npcs/valen.htm">Valen</a> has found she can mitigate this somewhat by using a space suit cooling system to help dissipate the heat. In the few times she has used the Hell Hand this has worked for up to ten firings in an hour period.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fine tuning the Hut regeneration system and the links between it and the crew has allowed <a href="../npcs/valen.htm">Valen</a> to fire the Hell Hand at will. There is still a terrible cost in physical well-being of channelling that much energy through her. She will become gaunt, bleached and skeletal as the energies tear the flesh from her body, consuming it in the terrible surges of power. The last time she used it, during the Hell Gate Wars, it left her bleeding from the eyes and three-quarters dead, however, she had been firing it almost constantly for hours during that battle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the instanced versions of the Hut, the fine tuning isn't there. The Keepers can only fire it 3 times a day without serious personal injury.</p>
