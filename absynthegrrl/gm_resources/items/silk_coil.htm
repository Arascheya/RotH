<p class="pagecaption">Silk Coil Harness</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rope bondage is an ancient and well loved Japanese art; intricately knotted rope corsets and sexual harnesses appear on the majority of Japanese porn DVDs and UMDs. Traditional harnesses wrap tightly around the breasts and throat, lifting and defining the breasts, with lower ropes cutting cruelly into the thighs or running along the woman’s vulva.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Silk Coil Harness follows the ‘traditional’ pattern. It is an intricanately knotted body harness of soft white silk rope decorated with golden and crimson threads. The golden threads seem to move across the woman’s body like speckles of light. Despite its incredibly tight fit and restrictive design, the Silk Coil Harness is surprisingly comfortable and supple, and when worn against bare skin is a constant erotic stimulus. The Silk Harness can be, and often is, worn under conventional clothing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While wearing the Harness, a woman receives a +3 enhancement bonus to her DEX score. She can contort her body in a seemingly endless variety of ways, and she gains the Omni-Dexterity feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At will, the Harness’s wearer can command her bondage harness to glow, as if affected by a light spell cast by a first level caster. The wearer must expose the full harness to illuminate the rope.</p>
