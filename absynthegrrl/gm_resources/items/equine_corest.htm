<p class="pagecaption">Equine Corset</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Equine Corset blends pony play and sorcery, submission and magic. Handcrafted from fine grain leather, the suffocating corset includes a padded ‘saddle’ and rune-inscribed pommel above the spine. The leather corset is attached through a complex series of buckles and straps, which tightly compress the wearer’s belly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While wearing the Equine Corset, a humanoid creature of Medium size or larger becomes an ideal mount. The wearer receives a +10 ft improvement to his or her base land speed, as well as access to the Run feat, even if he or she does not meet the prerequisites.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Corset’s thick leather straps give the wearer a +3 equipment bonus to Defense, has a -1 armor check penalty, and reduces the wearer’s max
DEX bonus to Defense to +6.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Corset’s wearer gains the ability to carry a single rider of Medium size or smaller, without affecting her encumbrance. To carry a rider, the Corset’s wearer drops to all fours. While carrying a rider, the Equine Corset’s wearer cannot take actions other than speech and movement. While carrying a rider, the Corset’s wearer gains the ability to run on walls and across ceilings, as if effected by a spiderclimb spell cast by a 5th level mage. The spiderclimb effect ends if the creature’s rider dismounts, or if the Corset wearer bucks the rider off.</p>
