<p class="pagecaption">Adoration Smoke</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Adoration Smoke is a cloying blue-grey mist that lowers inhibitions, devastates wills and seduces the unwary. A pinch of Adoration Smoke is usually found wrapped in silver foil and black silk. A conniver can swallow the pinch of Adoration Smoke, and later exhale its narcotic vapors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once you swallow a pinch of Adoration Smoke, it remains dormant within your body for 1d6+1 minutes. If unused, the Smoke dissipates harmlessly, its effect lost. As a standard action, you may exhale the Adoration Smoke, affecting any single sentient humanoid within 10 ft. Your potentially victim must be sexually attracted to members of your gender, if not the effect is wasted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The smoke’s victim must succeed at a DC 16 WILL Save, or immediately become charmed by you. This fleeting charm means that for the next 1d6 minutes, the victim is treated as being two attitude categories friendlier to you. During this time, the victim is slightly dazed, and suffers a -1 penalty on Initiative Checks and WILL saves.</p>
