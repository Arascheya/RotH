<p class="pagecaption">Spider Ship</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spider Ships are formed from the souls of dead Spider Kin and Spider Born. There are seven of them in existance, each one assigned to a <a href="../info/seal_teams.htm">Seal Team</a>. is it is formed of the souls of Ishra's favorite worshippers and minions. They serve in places of honor and the selection process is long because so many want the honor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When <a href="../npcs/aztol.htm">Aztol</a> captures one of the ships, its souls howl in rage and frustration that they must serve such an unworthy being. They cry out to the Abyss for salvation and the release of their beloved Ishra. The ship becomes sick and no longer functions as well as it did before capture. It now appears dirty, damaged, andapproaching derelict status. Aztol has no idea what could be wrong. He starts to equip the ship with technological items from other realms. This further damages the ship, similar to tissue rejection in other beings. He keeps welding additional tech into the ship until its souls go into a catatonic state. This halts the decay, but does not reverse any of the damage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He enslaves the commander, using a brain scan unit he stole. The rest of the teamwas given the choice to join him or die. All chose death. He had to recruit newbeings to crew the ship and use the brain scan device to force the commander to train them.</p>
