<p class="pagecaption">Necromancer’s Phallus</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The secret techniques and dark rituals required to animate an unbreathing servitor are well documented, at least among the world’s secret libraries. There are even darker ways to awaken the dead, to give them a kind of unholy false life.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The necromancer’s phallus is an intricately carved stone or wood dildo, whose surface is adorned with low-relief images of lifeless maidens on altars and operating tables being violated by their embalmers. The disturbing images provide a clue to the phallus’ function: if used to violate the body of a dead female (of any humanoid species), in a dark, necrophiliac ritual lasting at least one hour, the corpse-woman rises from her grave as a powerful undead servant.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once per day, the Necromancer’s Phallus can be used to create a unique, enhanced Zombie from any humanoid corpse. The corpse gains the Zombie template, with the following modifications.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The raised corpse can move and act normally, and may take both a move and a standard action each round.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The raised corpse’s Intelligence and Charisma scores are reduced by -8 (minimum 1 each). As such, the zombie can speak any languages it knew in life, possibly even read, but rarely communicates unless commanded to do so by its master.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The raised corpse retains a single rank in any skills it possessed 8 or more ranks in during its life.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The undead creature created serves you loyally until destroyed, or until you use the phallus to animate another undead servitor. You may have only one undead servitor, created by the Phallus, in existence at any one time.</p>
