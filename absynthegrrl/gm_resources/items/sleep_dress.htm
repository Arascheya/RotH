<p class="pagecaption">Sleep Eyed Dress</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It may take the form of a designer ball gown, a loose and comfortable sundress or a well worn nightie, but it is always the soft blue of the Japanese sky at noon. The Sleep Eyed Dress is a tool of seduction and deception, a temptress’ weapon. The enchanted threads seem to whisper gentle lullabies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While wearing the Sleep Eyed Dress, a woman gains the ability to cast sleep as a 5th level caster three times per day, or ray of fatigue, as a
5th level caster as often as once per minute. Those who would find the wearer sexually attractive suffer a -2 penalty on their WILL saves. As a standard action, the wearer can command the dress to change it’s appearance, style of clothing, even texture and material, though its color always remains a soft blue.</p>
