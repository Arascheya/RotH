<p class="regtxt5">Coinless Card</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Coinless Card is a minor but universally sought piece of modern arcana. It appears as a major company credit card, completely ordinary and mundane. The small plastic credit card is bright crimson, and has a cartoon cat raising it’s paw, coin in hand as a device. The cat is the same lucky symbol of worldly wealth that Buddhist shopkeepers keep behind their cash registers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Using the coinless card to make a purchase allows the user to purchase any item or service with a Purchase DC of 4 or less automatically, without expending resources or requiring a Wealth Check. The card is usable as often as needed, summoning otherworldly wealth to allow the user to live comfortably even in the leanest times.</p>
