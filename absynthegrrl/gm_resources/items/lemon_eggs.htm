<p class="pagecaption">Lemon Eggs</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lemon Eggs are an especially intimate form of magic. Like Lemon Drops, Lemon Eggs are smooth crystal ovids made of some indefinable amber mineral. Instead of grooves and incised symbols, the Lemon Eggs are studded with gently raised calligraphy and slightly raised nodules.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lemon Eggs are inserted in to a willing user’s body, either vaginally or anally, or in some cases, both. Lemon eggs are a type of single use wondrous item, similar to a magic potion. A magic user with the Forge Gift: Minor Arcana can choose to craft Lemon Eggs rather than typical items.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lemon Eggs differ from conventional potions in one major way: they require an orgasm to activate, and have far longer lasting effects than typical potions. The Lemon Egg user must masturbate or be masturbated to orgasm with an Egg, which usually requires several minutes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A beneficial spell effect stored in a Lemon Egg has a duration of a number of hours equal to the spell’s caster level. The duration might be longer if the original spell has a longer duration. Spells with instant durations (such as healing magic, or an offensive ability) do not have their durations extended.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Realms of the Hut modification:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A healing variant of the Lemon Egg can be created using extra healing potions and spells. When created in this way the egg will remain active until all the doses of extra healing used in the creation process are consumed. In this way a person can insert and activate an egg and then it will apply healing to them automatically until all doses are consumed. Healing Eggs retain the pleasure sensations without the distraction effect. Instead the pleasure increases the user's endurance and ability to withstand pain. Consider this a -1 modifier to all damage accrued while the egg is active.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Once the healing Lemon Egg’s magic is discharged, the egg itself explodes painlessly, melting away into a puddle of vicious amber liquid. This liquid oozes out of the orifice in a slightly sticky mess.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Healing eggs are indestinguishable from other Lemon Eggs except by flavor. Licking a healing egg will release the faint flavor of lavender and lime.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rather than activating the effects of the magic immediately, the user can leave the magic inert within his or her body, in which case the Lemon Egg pulses softly and pleasurably until the magic is unleashed. The user can hold the Lemon Egg’s magic dormant after orgasm for a number of hours equal to his or her WIS modifier (minimum one hour). During this time, the pleasurable sensations are a constant distraction, imposing a -1 penalty on all INT and WIS based skill checks and WILL saves.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once the Lemon Egg’s magic is discharged, the egg itself explodes painlessly, melting away into a puddle of vicious amber liquid. This liquid oozes out of the orifice in a slightly sticky mess. When the magic’s duration ends, the user is considered fatigued. If already fatigued the user instead becomes exhausted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The base cost of a Lemon Egg, or similar magic device is spell level x caster level x 100 dollars.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Most Lemon Eggs look virtually identical, regardless of what magic is stored within them. By licking or sucking on an unused Egg, a user can
attempt a DC 10 Spellcraft to determine the type of magic stored within.</p>
