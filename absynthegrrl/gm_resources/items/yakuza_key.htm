<p class="regtxt5">The Yakuza’s Key is a fragile copper key with a heft wrapped in red cloth. The slender key has an unusual notch pattern, which seems to change slightly every time you look away from it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Yakuza’s key is a magic item prized by spies, burglars, car thieves and worse criminals. So long as it has at least one charge remaining, the Key is considered a masterwork Car Opening Kit and Lock pick Set (+1 bonus on Disable Device checks to open locks, as well as Repair checks made to hotwire a vehicle).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Each time a charge is expended, the Yakuza’s Key grants its user a +5 circumstance bonus on his next Disable Device or Repair check made to hotwire a car. Prior to making the check, the user may choose to expend any number of charges; each charge expended grants an additional +5 circumstance bonus.</p>
