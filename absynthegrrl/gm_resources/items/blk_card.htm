<p class="pagecaption">Black Card</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Black Card is the a vital tool for modern spies and criminals, a magical artifact of negligible power and infinite utility. The Black Card is a counterfeit drivers license, made by pressing a dried strip of the owner ’s own skin between laminate sheets. Covered with invocations to long forgotten gods of theft, illusion and guile, the Black Card takes the form of any drivers license, from any country or state, and always perfectly matches whatever con its owner is attempting to pull. Even more impressive, when a Black Card is checked against police databanks, it always seems to match to the user ’s story, presenting a driving and criminal history designed not to arouse suspicion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As a full round action, the Black Card’s owner can concentrate on the card. The card will alter physically its printing, forging a perfect duplicate of any drivers license or government ID card, assuming the user has at least a passing familiarity with that ID. The Black Card instantly forges the appropriate document, and has a +20 bonus on its Forgery check. The Black Card remains in a specific form until it is consciously transformed again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Since the card physically changes, a true seeing spell has no effect, though a detect magic spell will detect its aura of faint illusion magic.</p>
