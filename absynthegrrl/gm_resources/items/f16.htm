<p class="regtxt5">A ruthless competition</p>
<p class="regtxt5">During 1971 the US Air Force asked five companies to produce concepts for a lightweight fighter using advanced aerodynamics and a "fly-by-wire" control system for high maneuverability. Finally, contracts were let for General Dynamics YF-16 and Northrop YF-17 prototypes, and the YF-16 was declared winner of the Light-Weight Fighter competition during January 1975.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A windfall for industry</p>
<p class="regtxt5">From the YF-16 emerged the Fighting Falcon that entered service in 1978 in its F-16A and F-16B forms with the F100-P-200 engine. The program will run to some 3,250 aircraft, and in addition to US production there is a European four-nation construction consortium. The F-16 is on the cutting edge of technology especially in its sophisticated avionics that include, in later versions, sensors for low-level navigation and night attack. These later models are the F16C and F-16D which possess, in addition to better electronics and more modem weapons for multi-role use, the capability to accommodate either of two engine types.</p>
