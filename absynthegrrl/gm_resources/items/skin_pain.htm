<p class="pagecaption">Skin of Pain</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the depths of hell, demon tanners work the skins of sinners, flaying souls alive to create dark works of blood art. Demonic warriors go into battle wearing the skins of violated maidens and fallen priests, and occasionally, their horrific armor finds its way into the hands of a mortal warrior.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Skin of Pain is alive, at least on some level and greedy, hungry for the blood of a living host. The Skin of Pain is a gruesome body stocking made of supple human leather, a patchwork abomination of a dozen different skin tones. Pulsing red muscle is visible beneath the skin patches.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Skin of Pain fits tightly to its wearer, like a second skin; it is difficult to tell where the wearer ends and the Skin begins. The Skin exposes only the wearer’s hands, feet, face and genitals. The dark armor is fever hot to the touch, and continually drips trace amounts of blood and urine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Each day the Skin of Pain is worn, the wearer suffers 1d6 points of temporary CON drain and 1d3 points of temporary WIS drain, making the suit exceptionally lethal and impractical for prolonged wear. Donning or removing the Skin is a full round action; while inert, the Skin resembles a grotesque, but unloving suit of human-skin armor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Skin of Pain grants its wearer a +4 natural armor bonus to Defense, as well as rendering the wearer immune to pain and fear effects, such as the shaken condition. While wearing the Skin of Pain, the wearer becomes immune to subdual damage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finally, while  wearing the supple and powerful Skin of Pain, the wearer receives a +4 profane bonus to Climb,  Jump, and Tumble checks.</p>
