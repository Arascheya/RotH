<p class="pagecaption">Enenra Rubber</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Enenra Rubber is a fully enclosed suit of rubber and PVC, worn by fetishists and imbued with the breath-stealing power of the black smoke. The Enenra Rubber is a ninja’s dream, a soldiers greatest asset. The Rubber allows its wearer to move as silently as the wind, and kill as certainly as VX nerve gas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Enenra Rubber is a rubber and PVC body stocking complete with a fully enclosed mask. The Enenra’s mask resembles a stylized gas mask enhanced with animalistic and demonic features. Several curling horns jut from the helmet, and the gas mask’s canisters are sculpted to resemble boars tusks. Protective kanji are written on the suit’s lining in blue and pink shellfish ink.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While wearing the Enenra Rubber the wearer becomes completely immune to suffocation, strangulation and inhalation toxins, and has no need to breathe. The wearer can become ethereal for a total of 40 rounds (4 minutes) per day, in single round increments. Becoming ethereal or solidifying is a free action.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While ethereal, the wearer can pass easily through solid objects, is immune to most forms of physical harm, and gains a limited flight speed of 20 ft (poor).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once per day, the Enenra’s wearer can exhale a cloud of mustard yellow gas through his tusk like breathing tubes. This lethal cloud is identical to a Cloudkill spell cast by a 10th level mage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The tightly fitting leather body suit provides a +1 equipment bonus to Defense, has no armor check penalty, and does not lower the wearer’s maximum DEX bonus. The body stocking can be further enchanted for greater protection, or reinforced with mundane armor.</p>
