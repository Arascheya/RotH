The Windows 8 keyboard-shortcut cheat sheet
Based on data found here: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/new-keyboard-shortcuts

If there’s one feature of Windows 8 that plays no favorites with finger-swiping on touch screens, it’s the vastly expanded keyboard shortcuts. Although most work with a combination of the Windows key (shortened below to WinKey) and one other key, the Ctrl and Alt keys are there to help you navigate quickly, too.

    WinKey - The most important keyboard shortcut; toggles between Metro and Desktop
