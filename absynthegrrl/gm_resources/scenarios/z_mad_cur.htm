<p class="regtxt5">/* Zeltrop - after return */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hand is seeking Soul Eater to close the Hell Gate on level 4 and in his fortress. He then wishes to open new ones.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aztol wants the Cobra Book and he wants any other information he might be able to get from Valen and crew. He also wants Shandi delivered to her father so his revenge can be complete.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Faction war is brewing in Sigil. Several of the main players are being urged on by Aztol. Several of his spies are about in the town as well. There are chances for the players to spot them once they reach Sigil.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lady of Pain will send a sedan chair for Valen once she knows she is in Sigil. This will call for her within an hour after her arrival regardless of where in the city she is. She will be treated with courtesy and deference at all times when the guards are asking her to enter and go with them.</p>
