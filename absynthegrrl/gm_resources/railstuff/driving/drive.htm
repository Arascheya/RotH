During the summer I spent 6 weeks in England visiting universities
there to look at networking etc. as part of my job. However, I also
took the opportunity to visit several railway museums and preserved
railways while there.
<P>
Frankly, the UK must be "steam heaven"! You can't help but fall over
museums, working railways, live steam and model engineering clubs etc.
I prepared for my trip by downloading and studying
<A HREF="http://homepages.uel.ac.uk/1278/">
Mark Dewell's Railway Preservation Pages.</A> This is a must for
Steam enthusiasts living in or visiting the UK. The entry that caught
my eye was the one for the Birmingham Railway Museum at Tysley, Birmingham.
They offered Steam Locomotive Driving Courses. Well, what steam enthusiast
could turn down that opportunity!
<P>
A fax to the museum got a prompt and informative reply and another fax
booked my courses. Courses? Yes, they offered two driving courses. In the
standard  one day course you get to drive two locomotives,
<A HREF="defiant3.jpg">GWR Castle Class 5080 Defiant</A> and an 0-4-0
industrial tank engine, <A HREF="cadbury1.jpg">Cadbury</A>, as well as get
a tour of their restoration workshops and a spell in the signal cabin.
<P>
The other course, called the "Breakfast Special" sees you at the museum at
6:00 a.m. to prepare the locomotives, oiling, coaling and watering etc., have
a hearty "engineman's breakfast" and then take Defiant off the sheds and spend
about two hours driving.
<P>
Well, being a glutton for punishment I signed up for both courses in a single
day! At the end of it I had had 12 hours of intense railway experience, I was
exhausted, dirty, and incredibly happy! Let me tell you how it went.
<P>
<IMG SRC="cline.gif">
<P>
<H2>6:00 a.m.</H2>
I drove into the Tysley car park promptly at 6:00 a.m. (being British!)
and could see smoke rising from behind the fence from two locomotives.
Following the instructions I had been given I went inside as was met by
<A HREF="footgeog.jpg">George Richards</A> who was to be my instructor for most of the day.
I must say a word about the people at the museum. They volunteer their time and
George and his mate had been at the museum the evening before laying the fires and
getting up steam in the locomotives until the early hours. A couple of hour's sleep
in a cabin and they were up again to greet us "students". They were very
friendly, helpful and willing to share their knowledge and experiences with
us. Wonderful people!
<P>
There was one other student crazy enough to join the early morning shift, and
we were taken to be fitted with overalls and the mandatory orange "hi viz"
waistcoat. Then on to the <A HREF="footplt1.jpg">footplate of Defiant</A>,
where George showed us around, explaining the controls and showing us
<A HREF="firing.jpg">firing</A> techniques etc. We <A HREF="coaling.jpg"> topped
off</A> the 4000 gallon tender with water and then it was time to "oil round".
<P>
The fire had been burning slowly over night and pressure was coming up,
so the blower was then cracked to move things along while we were given oil feeders
and taken around the engine to lubricate slides and bearings etc. GWR Castles are
1920's designs and like most British locomotives of that era have to have oil
reservoirs and cups filled manually before each trip. No central lubrication here!
The cylinders and regulator are lubricated by a "sight feed" system controlled from
the footplate.
<P>
After oiling the outside motion we got up on the front of the engine and opened
the smokebox door the check the level of ash. If the buildup obstructs the bottom
fire-tubes then some shoveling is required. Fortunately for us the smokebox was
pretty clean and we were able to get a good look at the superheater header and
drafting arrangements. GWR locomotives were designed to burn soft Welsh coal and have
a long narrow and deep Belpair style firebox. This needs a strong draft to get
combustion air through the thick fire and GWR engines were noted for their strong
staccato exhaust beat.
<P>
One more section of the engine to oil, the inside motion. Castles are four cylinder
engines with inside Walscherts gear driving the valves on the inside cylinders.
<A HREF="cvalve.jpg">Rocking levers</A> transfer motion to the front of the outside
cylinder valve stems. So to get to the oiling points between the frames Defiant had
to be moved over a pit so we could go underneath. Moving off for the first time (George
at the regulator) was very similar to getting our smaller live steam engines moving.
Cylinder drain cocks open, brakes on, full forward gear and crack the regulator to move
steam through the cylinders to warm them and blow out condensed water. Close the regulator,
wind the gear into full reverse and do the same again to blow out the other ends of the
cylinders. Then brakes off and we move back in a cloud of steam to the pits.
<P>
Once stopped over the pits George "scotched" the engine, put the "Not to be Moved"
boards on it and we went underneath. Now I am 6 foot 1 1/2 inches tall and there is
not much space under the engine between the frames. With some guiding hints from
George I was able to get up by the big-end bearings and fill the oil cups. My
fellow student oiled the slide bars and valve gear. The inside cylinders drive the
front coupled axle while the outside cylinders drive the centre coupled axle. This
puts the inside cylinders forward, and the rocking arms drive the outside cylinder
valves from the front.
<P>
All oiled up, steam pressure up, its time for breakfast! By this time you definitely
are hungry and the bacon, sausage, eggs and fried bread go down very well with coffee.
Then its back to Defiant for what we really came for ... Driving!
<P>
<IMG SRC="cline.gif">
<P>
<H2>Driving DEFIANT</H2>
To be honest, as any engine driver will tell you,
<A HREF="defiant7.jpg">driving a light engine</A> is not
difficult. The skill comes in handling a heavy train. However, everyone has to start
somewhere and so for the next couple of hours my fellow student and I took turns in
driving Defiant up and down the museum track. The technique goes like this:
<P>
Starting from the platform the track curves to the left and then there is a rising
grade all the way to the end of the track. Defiant is only brought into the platform
to change crews to reduce wear on the tires and tracks going round this curve. So we
started just outside the platform where the reversing gear is wound into forward gear.
Max. cutoff is 75%, but as we are pulling no load we can start notched back to 65% cutoff.
<P>
Next release the vacuum brake and watch the train pipe gauge for a rising vacuum. If it
is releasing too slowly a brief burst on the large ejector soon has the brakes off and
then a <A HREF="footkm2.jpg">tug on the regulator</A> starts us moving. Opening up a
little more has us accelerating nicely and we soon pass the
<A HREF="defiant4.jpg">signal box</A> and wind the cutoff back to 45%. The softening of
the exhaust beat is clearly heard as we "notch up" but we still accelerate. The regulator
is kept open until we
<A HREF="defiant5.jpg">pass the workshops</A> at which point it is closed and we coast to the
end of the track. As it's still a rising grade Defiant begins to slow and very little
brake application is needed to bring us to a halt at the end of the track.
<P>
To return we wind the gear into reverse and 45% cutoff. Hardly any power is needed to
start Defiant back down the grade so a quick <A HREF="footkm3.jpg">burst of regulator</A>
held for about five exhaust beats gets us moving smartly. Then it's hand on the
brake valve while <A HREF="defiant6.jpg">looking back</A> over the tender and as soon as
we reach the signal box start brake applications to bring us to a (hopefully) gentle
halt just outside the station. Now, that took some practice as the brake valve handle
movement controls the "rate" of application, not the amount. Tricky, and it makes you
appreciate the experts that can bring a train to a smooth and precise stop.
<P>
Then we do it all over again, gear to 65% forward, brakes off, regulator open and off
we go. Each student gets two "circuits" and then hands over. Before handing over brakes
are fully applied and the engine set to mid gear. "Classes" can have up to three students
taking turns, but I was fortunate to only have one other person on both of my courses, so
I got to do more driving and became quite good at stopping exactly at the marks. It is
difficult to describe the <A HREF="footkm1.jpg">satisfaction</A> it gives.
<P>
Finally we brought Defiant into the station to <A HREF="defiant2.jpg">hand over</A> to the first class on the regular
one-day course, having prepared and "warmed-up" Defiant for them. Of course, I got to drive
her again later in the day.
<P>
<IMG SRC="cline.gif">
<P>
<H2>The "One-Day Course"</H2>
We finished the "Breakfast Special", by handing over Defiant to the next crew and watched
her <A HREF="dtender.jpg">leave the station</A>. It was now time to join my next class, the regular
one-day course. For this I was joined by another ex-patriate Brit., Michael Linde,
from Switzerland. Many thanks to Michael for taking the photos of me at the controls.
<P>
The one-day course started with a visit to the workshops where the Birmingham Railway
museum restores its own collection as well as doing restoration work for other museums
and private owners.
<P>
In the shops when I visited was <A HREF="works1.jpg">Pannier 0-6-0PT</A>number 7760
about a third of the way through a complete overhaul, and <A HREF="dinmore.jpg">Dinmore
Manor</A> number 7820, which is a contract restoration. It was just about ready to steam.
<P>
The shops have a wheel turning lathe and a wheel-drop that enables a set of wheels to be
removed from a locomotive without hoisting the entire engine. A most interesting visit
which certainly allows you to "get up close" to the works of a locomotive.
<P>
The next stage in the course was back to Defiant. Of course, by this time I felt like
an old hand, and handled that regulator as if I was born to it! (At least, that's my story
and I'm sticking to it!). As you can see, my partner, <A HREF="footplt2.jpg">Michael</A>,
soon got the hang of it too.
<P>
A break for lunch followed (fish and chips) and then it was on to the
<A HREF="sbox2.jpg">signalbox</A> for a <A HREF="sbox1.jpg"> lesson in signaling</A>,
track circuits, the block system and so on. The Tysley box is
special in that it has a locking system that prevents the signalman, or his
novice students, from actually changing any of the points or signals without a special
key. That <A HREF="key.jpg">key is kept in the cab of Defiant</A> while courses are in
progress so that the track is set and clear for her.
<P>
<IMG SRC="cline.gif">
<P>
<H2>Driving CADBURY</H2>
The last section of the course is another footplate session, this time on
<A HREF="cadbury2.jpg">Cadbury</A>, an 0-4-0 industrial tank engine. Cadbury was once
owned by Cadbury Chocolate company and now lives at Tysley.
<P>
A <A HREF="cadfoot3.jpg">peek in the cab</A> shows how cramped it is. The large reverse lever
("Johnson Bar" to our American friends) dominates the right side of the cab, and you can see
that the regulator has three handles. This is so the driver can operate from either side of
the cab if required during shunting. A large hand-brake stand takes up more space in the
cab so with the three of us it was cosy to say the least.
<P>
Cadbury is a powerful little engine and with no load takes off like a rocket.
Brakes are steam operated and a little easier to get the hang of than the vacuum brakes
on Defiant. George cautioned us to go easy over the point-work as Cadbury has a higher
axle loading than Defiant and likes to "come off" if driven too hard! Well we kept
her <A HREF="cadfoot2.jpg">under control</A> and thoroughly <A HREF="cadfoot1.jpg">enjoyed</A>
ourselves.
<P>
As we were the last class of the day we ran the full length of the track right into the
station each "circuit". One each arrival a <A HREF="cadcoal.jpg">"coaling crew"</A> would
load the coal bunker with buckets. In this way Cadbury was coaled up for the next day.
Finally it was time to put Cadbury back in the yard, so we gave the key back to the \
signalman, who then set the road for us and we took her in.
<P>
The day ended with a debriefing and a cup of coffee while watching a video on the
rescue and restoration of Defiant. The restoration was carried out in a record 18 months
and is a tribute to the dedication of the BRM volunteers. Finally we were given our
Certificates, most important! I am now a certified(?) steam locomotive driver!
<P>

<P>
<H2>The Rest of the Birmingham Railway Museum</H2>
There is lots more to see at the museum, so I went back the next day to take some more
photos and video. Here are just a few:
<P>
<A HREF="henry.jpg">Henry</A>, a small 0-4-0 industrial tank engine.
<P>
<A HREF="victor.jpg">Victor</A>, a modern 0-6-0 industrial tank engine. Victor was built
for the Steel Company of Wales by Bagnall of Stafford in 1951, so it is as old as I am!
It has all possible labor saving devices - roller bearings, firegrate that could be
rocked and dropped, a hopper ashpan that can dump ash in seconds, and complete
<A HREF="lube.jpg">mechanical lubrication</A>. This is one powerful locomotive.
<P>
<A HREF="number6.jpg">Number 6</A>, a small 0-4-0 industrial saddle tank engine. The
observant will notice that the number and colour scheme identify this little engine
as Percy in the Thomas the Tank Engine stories!
<P>
This <A HREF="crane.jpg">steam crane</A> is used by the museum to lift and erect
boilers.
<P>
A <A HREF="garrett.jpg">narrow gauge Garret</A>, an 0-4-0+0-4-0 which looks
to me as if it is a compound. The rear cylinders look like the high pressure
cylinders, the front ones are larger.
<P>
<H2>Your Move!</H2>
Well, that was my visit. I hope you enjoyed the "taste of Tysley". If your appetite
has been whetted then I suggest you call <STRONG>Jackie Roxborough</STRONG> or
<STRONG>Jo Howard</STRONG> at 0121 707 4696.
You won't regret it!
<P>

<H2>Other Driving Courses</H2>
There are several other Railway Centres offering similar one or half day driving courses.
The GWR Railway Society centre at Didicot and the Buckingham Railway Centre at
Quainton are two that I know of.  You
can get details of these centres from <A HREF="http://homepages.uel.ac.uk/1278/">
Mark Dewell's Railway Preservation Pages - accessible from his home page.</A>
<P>
For more "in depth" training there is a school located at the Bluebell Railway.
For a very good account of one man's experience on the week long course at Footplate Ways and Days
please check out Dewi William's

This is a very enjoyable read, and good photos that really put you there.
