<h4>Coupling the large brake-van</h4>

The link has a right-hand thread at one end
and a left-hand thread at the other; thus 
rotating the link (swinging the weight over and over) 
will tighten or loosen the coupling. The weight carries 
at lot of momentum: if the short locking-bar flips over and
hits your wrist,
it can be very painful!
