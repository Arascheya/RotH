<h4>Filling the tanks with water</h4>

The hand-wheel has to be turned <b>clockwise</b> 
to turn on the water. The "bag" hangs from the pipe overhead
and another crew member guides it into the filler-port
on the locomotive's side-tank.

<p>
This water-pipe is on the platform at Sheffield Park, 
at the Horsted-Keynes end of the platform. 
When not in use, the bag is left dangling into the thing in 
the background
that looks like a metal basket.
This minimizes spraying water on innocent passengers.
