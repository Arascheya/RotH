In steam train days, the Golden Arrow (the "Fl&#232;che d'Or") 
was the crack Pullman express between London (Victoria) and
Paris (Gare du Nord). It is now reduced to running 
between Sheffield Park and Horsted Keynes. 
This photo shows the Golden Arrow ready to leave Sheffield Park 
in the morning.
