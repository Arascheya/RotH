<img src="cutoff.jpg">
<p>Practising the use of valve-gear control 
(reverser control bar, or cut-off control)
on different types of locomotive.
<p>The locomotive shown here had no counterweights on the 
valve-gear mechanism: pulling the lever lifted the whole
linkage. Prepare to take the weight <b>before</b> releasing
the catch, or you'll be pitched forward.
