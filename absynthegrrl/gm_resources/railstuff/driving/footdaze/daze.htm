<h2>Prelude: Monday, 27 September, 1993</h2>

<p>
I'd made arrangements to stay at a bed-and-breakfast establishment
for the duration of the
course, and my cousin was kind enough to give me a ride there on
the day before the
course actually started. He dropped me off mid-morning: there was
nobody at home, but I
left my suitcase and backpack in the front porch and set out for
the Bluebell Line, the railway
where the course was to take place.

<p>
The footpath wandered away from the road; I followed it but it lead
to a windmill.
However, after about a mile, there was a sign pointing to the
railway, plus the “King’s Arms”
pub. After another two miles, I came to Sheffield Park station,
where I wandered around
getting the geography of the place. By now I was getting pretty
hungry, so I went into the
pub: it’s built into the station, downstairs from the cafeteria. I
made my usual mistake:
ordering while hungry. The steak-and-kidney pie was huge! It had a
great mound of puff
pastry rising out of the dish. When I saw it, I gasped, and this
attracted the attention of the
couple at the next table, who had North American accents. It later
turned out that these
were Ray, another of the students on the course, and his wife
Marilyn.

<p>
After lunch, I rode to the end of the line (Coombe Bridge) and back
on the <a href="2oclock.htm"> 2 o’clock train</a>
just to get the feel of the line, and then purchased my
mandatory British Railways “grease-top” cap at the station store.

<p>
Walking back to the B-and-B, I was able to keep away from the road
for most of the route
and walk across the common keeping the windmill in sight.

<p>
At this point, there were three of us from the course
(Jim, Dave and myself) staying at
Lynn Hartley's “Wayside Cottage”.
Jim had already arrived, and he, too, like Ray and
myself, had been exploring the Bluebell Line before the course
started.
Dave was still trying to finish up work so he could join us,
and in fact he didn’t arrive until early the next
morning.

<h2>First and Second days: Tuesday and Wednesday</h2>

<p>
We were due to meet at Sheffield Park station at 08:45, so Lynn
told us to be down for
breakfast before 7:45. She provided an excellent breakfast, with
orange juice, cereal,
bacon, sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, and toast and marmalade. Plus
coffee, real coffee,
as well as tea. Jim and I both made approving noises about
the coffee,
and got into a discussion of the quality of coffee at work.
“Our cafeteria is a room filled with Sirius Cybernetics Corporation

vending machines” said Jim, Automat-ically.

<p>
I scrounged a ride with the others to the station
(in fact, they were very kind about transporting me all week).
In the parking lot, we eventually identified Clive's van: dark
green, it
was originally a BBC-TV outside broadcast control van. He intends
to have it repainted
with his logo. As the others showed up, we squeezed along the
benches in the van, and
started on the many cups of tea we were to consume, as we introduced
ourselves and
described our footplate experience (in most cases, very little) and
numbered ourselves in
order, so that we could work in pairs. There were six students
altogether, all male: one
from California, one from Canada (me) and four British.

<p>
Then, in our overalls and shiny new caps, we were shown the
“enginemen’s lobby”, where
we were warned we should sign-in every day that we were to be
on-site, and where we
made our daily contribution to the enginemen’s tea fund.

<p>

This part of the course consisted of two days of theory: each
morning and afternoon had a
lecture session and a session of looking at locomotives (or parts
of them) and crawling on,
under and inside them.

<p>

The Bluebell Line's training room was in the throes of
refurbishment,
so we used the reading room for lectures,
upstairs in the station building.
Here, Clive started us on learning the
mechanics of producing steam: the boiler, firebox, firetubes,
superheater, smoke box, and
so on; and fusible plugs - especially fusible plugs. From the
simple square firebox he
moved into the development of the sloping firebox as a true
combustion chamber, with
thermic siphons or water legs, and then into the techniques of
firing: where to throw the
coal, and how much, and when; and how to avoid the horrors of a
“green fire” and a “hole
in the fire”. (Some of us had reservations when he said that we’d
easily recognize a hole in
the fire by the distinctive sound it created. How, we thought,
would we recognize one
sound among all the other noises? But he was right: the “thrumming”
sound differs from
any other sound on the footplate).

<p>

This seemed plenty in itself, but we also covered control of the
engine, which included
valve-gear, timing, cut-off, use of the regulator, plus a few
goodies like blowing the ends
off the cylinders by not exhausting condensed steam; “going
hydraulic” and not being able
to close the regulator, “priming” through having too high a water
level in the boiler,
forgetting to use the feed-water injector and letting the water
level get too low, and so on!

<p>
Then there were the brakes: vacuum brakes, air brakes,
steam brakes, and “screw 'er down” (screw down the hand-brake).

<p>
And the lubrication: when and where to squirt in what type of oil,
and how that oil gets to
the bearing surfaces. At this point we had a bit of practical work:
we each had to make
“trimmings” consisting of strands of wool held in place by copper
wire, which siphon oil
from a container to where it’s needed.

<p>

At the end of the first day, three of us were ready to stagger back
to Lynn Hartley's. Les
had expected to bunk in a sleeping car or the crew car, and had
come equipped with a
sleeping bag etc. but found that he was not expected: in fact there
was no room for him. So
he too came to “Wayside Cottage” and prepared to put his bed in the
sitting room.

<p>
Each evening Lynn provided us with tea and buns or cookies as soon
as we came in the
door. On each day after the first, we weren't really fit to sit on
the furniture in our working
clothes, even with the overalls stripped off; so we showered and
changed in turn, and the
last one waiting for the shower had to drink tea standing up. Later
in the evening we all
went to one of the pubs for food. We tried the “King’s Arms” and
the “Five Bells”. The
latter insisted that Christmas had come early this year, with
carols and Christmas dinners.

<p>
Naturally, there was a practical side to this part of the course
as well as the theory. It
started with our being taken around the yard, the Bluebell Line’s
workshops,
and the public shed where various restored and partially restored
locomotives were kept. This was for
familiarization with different parts of locomotives,
and how to identify the controls on different types of loco,
and all the variations of the different types of linkage for the
<a href="cutoff.htm"> valve-gear</a>.

<p>
The most spectacular part was climbing into the firebox of a
Bulleid Pacific, two people at
a time. The trick is to grasp a fairly high-up handle in each hand,
swing both feet into the
fire-door opening, transfer hand grip to lower handles, ease body
further in, turn over and
wriggle the remaining distance.
Inside the firebox we could easily identify the components,
including the enormous thermic siphons.
Coming out of the firebox was a slight
variation on the entry procedure: squeeze out, roll over and get
two people to help you up.
Clive did give us one warning: on these engines, there’s a stub
lever sticking up beside the
firebox: it’s used for rocking the grate. Make sure somebody is
covering it because if you
slip, you’ll be like the engine itself: you’ll have a tender
behind!

<p>
Another thing we had to learn was
the <a href="trackmap.htm"> name of each track </a> and
which signal controlled which road:
which switch was controlled from the box in the
station, and which could be accessed by
<a href="switch.htm"> throwing the point lever</a> in the yard,
adjacent to the switch.
There were the two platform roads in the station,
the Pump-house siding, the Newick road
(which used to be the running line to Newick
when the Bluebell was a “real” railway),
the headshunt, and the six
yard tracks. There were the starter signals, the two signals
controlling entrance to the two
station roads and their shorter counterparts allowing cautious
entry even when the track
was occupied, and “dummy” signals at ground level.
<p>

During the second afternoon we were introduced
to <a href="our_loco.htm"> “our” locomotive</a>,
no. 263.
It was an 0-4-4 tank engine built in about 1905
for the South-Eastern and Chatham Railway.
From our point of view, it had two “interesting” characteristics:
it used the regular
train vacuum brake rather than steam brakes for the engine itself,
and it had a steam-powered reverser.
It was parked over the pit, so we could walk down the steps
and <a href="under263.htm"> look underneath</a> at the points that would need lubrication
and examine the reverser mechanism and
dampers.

<p>
At the end of the second day Clive handed us our exam papers,
to be handed in by Friday.
The cover sheet was a list of safety rules and regulations
which we were to sign as “read and understood”.
Back at Wayside Cottage,
I failed to obey the rule
“Look out for metal obstructions above your head”.
I bent over to unlace my safety shoes in the porch,
straightened up,
hit my head on a metal flower basket, staggered back,
and banged into and cracked a window pane.

<h2>Third day: Thursday, 30 September</h2>

<p>
We knew we'd have to start at about 08:00, because it would take
about two hours to get
steam up.
Lynn expected us down for breakfast soon after 7am.
Somewhere about the second pot of coffee,
Lynn asked “Where’s Dave?” He was still asleep!
But he was up in time
to eat breakfast and sign in more or less on time.

<p>
I was number two,
so my first task was to oil the inside and underneath stuff:
the axle journals,
the big end cranks and the oiling points on the trailing 4-wheeled
bogie.
Clive tossed
me a long once-white coat, with the comment “No need to get your
overalls dirty!”. I put
this on, filled up the lubricating can from the large oil-can, and
went under. First the big
ends: to do this I had to lay a plank across the pit and climb up
on it. In this position I was
bending right across the axle, but it was reasonably easy to grab
each cork with a rag, twist
it out, fill up with oil and replace the cork. One bearing took an
incredible amount of oil,
but none seemed to be leaking out. The other needed hardly any oil.

<p>
Then came the wheel bearings, and then off to the other end of the
locomotive.
The movement of the bogie (truck) is lubricated by four “onions”,
open-topped onion-shaped steel
capsules,
which hold the oil that is siphoned onto the
actual bearing surfaces by trimmings.
The only problem was how to get oil to flow into the onions, since
there was no
room to hold the oiling can high enough for oil to flow. The
solution was to work with a
very full can of oil, and then there was just enough gradient for
the liquid to flow.

<p>
Meanwhile, the rest of the crew was getting the fire going,
attending to all the other oiling
points and putting trimmings in the oil feed pipes,
and <a href="brasso.htm"> polishing the brass</a> within the cab
and outside.
Anybody who finished their assigned task had
to grab a paraffin-soaked
rag and <a href="paint.htm"> wipe down the painted areas</a>.
When we were about finished, it
started to rain, but the rain just beaded up and ran off the oily
paintwork.
<p>

Eventually, the moment arrived: we had about 140 lb/in&#178 pressure,
and the engine could be
moved, literally under its own steam. We backed up to the
headshunt, picked up the
smaller brake van, and we were ready for practical instruction.
First, student no. 1 drove
while no. 2 (that's me) fired; then no. 2 drove while no. 3 fired,
and so on.

<p>
The student who was learning to fire was introduced to John,
who had been with the Bluebell Line for 16 years.
He showed us how to pick up the deceptively small amount of coal
on the shovel, make a full swing, and turn the shovel’s handle to
flip the coal to the desired
place on the grate. It didn't need much effort for throwing, but
that flip! Sometimes the
coals would stay together in a clump and land in one spot, even if
it was not quite the right
spot, but sometimes they would spray right across the full width
of the grate. I ran through
my repertoire of curses.

<p>
John also showed us how to work the
feed-water <a href="injector.htm"> injector</a>.
I'm convinced that this is a black art.
Turn on the water three-quarters full, turn on the steam,
knock the water back a little, then on a little more, and the
injector starts. Well, that's how
John did it. For me, it was fiddle, fiddle, fiddle with the water
control until John gave it
one final gentle knock which started the injector every time.

<p>
Clive instructed the student driver.
“Make a brake” was easy:
move <a href="driver.htm"> the little black handle</a> to
turn on steam to the brake ejector to create a vacuum.
Then the reverser,
tricky, but not a black art because you could see what was happening
by looking at the
brass pointer. The method is: put the reverser lever to forward or
back, and “blip” the
steam control. The brass pointer echoes, on a graduated scale, the
position of the reversing
gear, and if you overshoot you can put the lever the other way and
“blip” the steam control
again. Finally, put the lever in the middle.

<p>
After a few tries at the reverser, the student could check the
signal (and get John to check
all was clear on his side), toot the whistle, and push the regulator
open.

<p>
The object of the lesson was
to <a href="stop.htm"> drive to a specific point</a> just
outside the station or to a
specific point on the platform,
and stop without a jerk: that is, at the final stop the brake
should be off.
We quickly found out about momentum: on
the flat, an engine
will coast a very long way with steam shut off! The little van we
had was equipped with
vacuum brakes which helped with stopping where we intended, but the
van also held the
four students who were awaiting their turns.
They were able to comment among themselves on the success
(or otherwise) of each attempt.
The prime rule was:
<strong>DO NOT LAUGH!</strong> for the next attempt may be yours.

<p>
Each run was only two or three hundred metres: but on each run, we
travelled from the
Eastern Hemisphere to the Western Hemisphere,
since the line
crosses the <a href="grnwich.jpg"> meridian of Greenwich</a> close
to the station.

<p>
The Fat Controller (actually, he's not fat, but he just seems to
fit that character in TV’s
“Shining Time Station”) told Clive that we had to shunt into the
<a href="pump_hse.htm">Pump-house siding</a> while
the service train came into the station and the engine ran around
to the other end of the
train.
Once in the siding, we were stuck for half an
hour or so, and some people
left the brake van for tea or personal pit stop. “I'm going outside
now chaps; I may be
some time” said Jim, freezingly.

<p>
There’s another short siding off the Pump-house siding,
and here we each practised hooking-up to other vehicles using
the old three-link coupling that was fitted to
unbraked vehicles.
This needs a “shunter's pole”,
a long pole made of baseball-bat wood with a hook on
one end.
<a href="couple3.jpg"> To hook-up</a>,
one needs to catch a link on the hook at the end of the pole,
make a long swing, and flip the link over the hook of the adjacent
vehicle.
To un-hook, slide the
pole up the slope of the hook, pushing the link up until it falls
off the hook. It's tricky
because you have to manipulate the weight and momentum of the link
from several feet
away, but after a few tries we were all able to do it without much
trouble, and earned our
class the title of “The Master Coupler”.

<p>
At the end of the day we had to dispose the engine, but couldn't
do a complete job as there
was another engine with a “Do Not Move” sign on it parked over the
pit. There was very
little ash in the smoke-box, but we did attend to the fire, the
lubrication, and got a load of
firewood (broken-up old pallets) stacked in the cab to dry out for
the next morning.


<h2>Fourth day: Friday, 1 October</h2>

<p>

Another 8 o'clock start. It was my turn for Brasso on the dome,
safety valves and anything
else outside the cab. That dome is enormous! I discovered that
there is a strong incentive to
get the dome polished as early as possible: as the boiler warms up,
the dome starts to get
hot - and more difficult to polish.
From the dome, safety valves, boiler bands and cab window-frames,
I worked my way downwards: brass numbers, oil reservoirs, brass
trim on
splashers, assorted copper pipes. Polishing the brass turns into a
stand-off between the
Brasso boys and paraffin-pushers: Brasso leaves marks on adjacent
paintwork, paraffin oil
dulls adjacent brasswork.

<p>

The first movements of the engine, once we had steam up, were to
park the small brake
van (caboose) and <a href="couple2.htm"> couple-up a larger one</a>.
The new one didn't have vacuum
brakes but it did have a little stove, which we immediately fired
up since the weather was
distinctly cold and wet. The lack of vacuum brake didn’t matter
since we towed the van
into the station, uncoupled it, and screwed the hand-brake on, very
thoroughly.
The day's mission was to practice driving up to the van
and stopping:
stopping close enough to compress the buffers so that
engine and van could be coupled,
but to do it gently enough that
we didn’t push the van from its parked position.

<p>
It turned into a lesson on parking by ear! It’s impossible to see
exactly where the buffers
are, or to see the closing distance between the engine and van, so
the trick is to make the
final approach with enough momentum to carry the engine the whole
distance, but slowly
enough for the buffers to absorb the impact.

<p>
As on the previous day, we had to move out of the way each time the
service train
approached the station.

<p>
During the day, too, we each learned how
to <a href="watering.htm"> fill up the tanks</a> with
water (to “put in the bag”).
The bag, a very wide flexible hose, sprayed water
from its connection
with the hinged metal pipe. While we couldn’t get clear of the
spray, we did learn the best
position to stand, on the engine's side tank.

<p>
At the end of the day, there was still an engine (ex-Southern
Railway Q-class) parked over
the pit, so we still couldn’t dump the contents of the ash-pan.

<p>
Clive suggested that we have curry for dinner at an Indian
restaurant in the next village. I
mentioned my ignorance of Indian food, and I hoped that Clive,
who’d fired locomotives
in India, would be able to advise me. “Clive of India?” asked Jim,
bravely. In fact it was an
excellent meal: good food and good service.

<h2>Fifth day: Saturday, 2 October</h2>

<p>
Today we had to book in at 07:00, since our first run was scheduled
for 09:30. As well as
three runs of the regular service train, there were to be two
“Golden Arrow” runs. Our
training runs out on the main line had to be squeezed in between
these public trains.

<p>
My job that morning was coaling: I followed Clive on to the tank
and on to the roof of the
cab.
<a href="coaling.htm"> Coal is loaded</a> from a skip attached to a fork-lift truck:
I'd wondered how a skip could
tip coal into the narrow coal-bunker behind the cab. The answer
became clear: the engine
was deliberately parked in an area that was paved between and
around the tracks. The
fork-lift came up behind the engine and drove forward until the
skip hung over the bunker.
Clive demonstrated the method of unloading the skip
and I attempted to emulate:
he pushed his shovel under the coal and withdrew it,
bringing with it a huge load
which he directed to the emptiest part of the bunker.
I jerked my shovel into the coal and withdrew it,
bearing one shovelful of coal, part of which I dropped overboard.
Ah well, practice makes perfect.

<p>
Clive's daughter Elizabeth meanwhile got the stove going in the
brake van. I was able to
conceal the coal that had fallen overboard by shovelling it into a
bucket for the stove.

<p>
The Q-class engine was still parked over the pit, but the “Do Not
Move” sign had been
taken down:
we were allowed to tow it away so we could use the pit to
clean out the ashpan.
Clive treated us to an unplanned demonstration of driving skill as
soon as our engine
had enough steam pressure to move. At that point, we had 60 lb/in&#178
pressure: but it would
take 120 lb/in&#178; to work the ejector for the vacuum brakes, so we
had no brakes at all. In
spite of this,
Clive backed out, drove up to the parked engine,
towed it up to the headshunt,
drove it forward onto another yard track and parked it close to a
stationary engine.
We were of course closely watching his use of the reversing gear
as a brake.

<p>

We were ready to leave before 09:30, but we were to be the first
train out, so off we went.
It had been raining heavily and continuously for hours, so as we
drove along the track on
an embankment, we could look down on submerged fields, flooded
roads, and streams
turned into rushing rivers. As we left Sheffield Park station there
were pheasants in one of
the drier fields; and shortly after, we ran into a flock of grouse
(do grouse come in flocks?)
apparently using the track as an overnight stop. The right-of-way
was covered in birds:
they were even perched on the rails. A toot on the whistle had no
effect. Most flew away as
we got close, but on our return past this point, I was looking out
of the back and saw a
bemused grouse appear from beneath the van, in the four-foot way.

<p>
At Horsted Keynes, the engine ran around the brake van and back we
went, about 5 miles
(8km) each way. After two trips, it was my turn to fire.

<p>
To start with, we had a thin even fire.
But we’d need steam for the climb up the bank to H-K
(Horsted Keynes, not Hong Kong).
But we’d have a long lay-over at H-K so we didn’t
want an enormous fire when we got there. It was just as well that
John was there to give
me instruction! Apart from one “hole in the fire” all was well. I
managed to spray coal in
all directions when I tried to cover the hole, but after a couple
more attempts John said
"Shut the doors"  and very quickly the general vibration shook the
coal over the hole and
the thrumming noise ceased.

<p>
Meanwhile John again had me practicing the art of the injector.
Once or twice I did manage
to get it going at once. On the other hand, there were those
times when . . .

<p>
As we approached H-K, John had me load up the back of the grate
with coal; both corners,
and just under the door.
Then we were at the entry to the station,
and I had to lean out with
the staff: the token which had been our authority to enter the
single track. Following
instructions, I held it out so that the signalman could grab it
from me as we passed. Then
we entered platform 1 and ran the engine around the van. This gave
practice in <a href="uncouple.htm"> uncoupling
and coupling</a> the screw couplings. Safety first! I think everyone
remembered to remove the
brake hose as the first task, and replace it as the last task.

<p>
During our 90-minute lay-over, we parked just at the end of a
normally unused platform,
so we could have use of the station's facilities. While we were
there, Ray and his wife
showed up. Ray had fallen sick and had been in bed most of the
previous day;
even on Saturday he was very weak
and couldn't even ride back with us in the brake van.
Marilyn told
us the story of washing his borrowed overalls before returning
them:
they had rented a cottage with a washer and dryer in the bathroom.
The dryer exhaust pipe was not connected
but had a note stuck on it to the effect that it should be connected
before use. She hooked it
up then opened the dryer - and a small animal popped out! She
screamed, shot out of the
room and closed the door. Unfortunately, she'd left the bath water
running, and by the time
she dared to crack the door open and look inside, the animal had
gone - but the bath had
overflowed.

<p>
After lunch, when the service train had left, we returned to
Sheffield Park. John spread the
piled-up coals across the grate, I started the injector, and off
we went, downhill for most of
the way, but pouring rain again. My cousins were bravely standing
on the platform as we
entered the station, rain dripping off them, cameras at the ready.

<p>
And then, it was my turn to drive.
There was a <a href="train.htm"> train </a> in the other
platform road,
so we could not run around the van. We uncoupled the van and moved
off to the Newick
road; the train engine moved onto the track we’d been on, pushed
the van into the head-
shunt, and returned to its train. We drove forward, backed up to
the van, and coupled up.
We knew we had to move away from there, because we’d be trapped
when the “Golden
Arrow” special arrived at platform 2; so we moved forward, right
through the station, and
backed up to the train in platform 1. I was to back up to a train
loaded with passengers,
with a van behind me! Gulp! But I did achieve it, stopping about a
metre away, as I was
told later.

<p>
After the <a href="goldenar.htm">Golden Arrow</a> had arrived,
we were given the staff (the single-line token) and a clear signal,
and off we went.
The start was similar to all the other starts we
had made, but after that I was in unfamiliar territory: whistle for
the bridle-path crossing,
open the regulator more for the up-grade,
slow for the speed-restriction area.
Then stop on
a slope, and do a hill-start. I learned that it’s a good idea to
keep your hand on the regulator
after you open it, so you can immediately close it if the wheels
slip!

<p>
For the first time I got to push the regulator hard over, to open
the second valve, and we
roared up the slope. Somewhere in that sequence I noticed that Les,
who was firing for me,
was not wearing his hat. Apparently he’d lost it some way back.

<p>
At H-K we made the run-around, but then had to wait for the
passenger train. We took the
opportunity to look at the work going on in the carriage repair
shed (passenger car shop).

<p>

On the return run, Les remembered approximately where he’d lost his
hat, so I slowed
down, and all hands kept a look-out. When his hat was spotted, I
heard a shout of “Whoa!”
so I put the handle down: full brake application. Even so, it took
quite a distance to stop,
so Les had to run back for his hat. Then a toot, and we resumed,
going to the flag-stop (the
halt) with its one-car-length platform. I managed to stop with only
the front of the brake
van at the platform: still, it fitted the definition of “at the
platform”. Then another toot,
back to Sheffield Park, and to dispose of the engine.

<p>

Again, my job was to be up on the roof for coaling, and surprise!
I was getting the coal to
go more or less where I wanted it to. Finally, we shovelled the hot
coals from the grate into
a wheelbarrow, taking turns so no one person got scorched but all
had tanned arms, and
stacked wood for the next crew.
Clive removed his <a href="head_brd.htm">Ways and Days</a> headboard,
and we all said our good-byes.


<h2>Postlude: Sunday, 3 October </h2>

<p>
Homeward bound! Air Canada had overbooked the economy class, so
poor me, I was
forced into first class. I loved it.

<p>
Six days later, we attended a wedding as friends of the bride.  To
my surprise, one of the
groom’s friends had attended the “Footplate Days and Ways” course:
and what’s more he
lives only a few houses away from me.

<p>
One further thought: before taking the course,
I'd wondered whether I had the strength
needed for shovelling the coal,
and I'd practiced left-handed and right-handed
snow-shovelling all winter.
I found that great strength isn’t
needed: it's quite small
amounts of coal, but skill is needed to deliver these where they
are needed. I'm sure
though that endurance is needed for a long run.

<p>
