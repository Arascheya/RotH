<h4>Practice in stopping no. 263 at a specific point</h4>

Ray has just stopped no. 263 at the water barrel 
(seen at the lower right of the photo)
and is preparing to drive back to the station.
The signal in the background controls the block between
Sheffield Park and Horsted Keynes: if we overshot the
signal, we would trip the track circuit and cause panic
in the signal-box (signal-tower).
