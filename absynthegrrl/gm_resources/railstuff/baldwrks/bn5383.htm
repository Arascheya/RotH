<p>The Burlington Northern asked for and received use of the Nebraska Zephyr for a number
of special events.  The first of these was in Fort Worth, Texas, for the unveiling of their
first SD70-MAC units.  As a "thank you," the IRM recieved BN 5383, a General Electric U30C
3000 hp, six-axle diesel locomotive.</p>
<p>As things happen, the IRM acquired two steam locomotives.  The first, Texas and New Orleans
number 975 is a 2-10-2 that (when this was all happening) was located in Beaumont, Texas.  The
second is CB&Q Hudson number 3007, that had been in Atlantic, Iowa.  The IRM needed to get these
units moved to our location in Union, Illinois, which meant a trip across the BN.  An arrangement
was made whereby the IRM would deliver 5383 back to the BN to provide motive power for the move
of these steam locomotives.  
Having a museum unit actually go to retrieve other museum pieces is a <i>first</i> in American
railroad museum history!</p>
<p>So far, so good.  There was only one problem.  Some of the wheelsets on 5383 were in serious
shape.  The museum sent 5383 to a professional locomotive maintenance center for that work. 
Many thanks to John Howell of the IRM Museum Board who provides us with these photographs, used
with his permission.

<p>Before the 5383 could be moved off IRM property, it had to undergo a standard 90-day inspection.

<p>The CB&Q locomotive (3007) was derailed in Des Moines (Norfolk Southern) and Hulcher called to 
rerail it. Fortunately, no damage was done to 3007. Here we see BN 5383 returning to the IRM with
CB&Q Hudson #3007 and Texas & New Orleans Santa Fe #975 in tow.</p>
