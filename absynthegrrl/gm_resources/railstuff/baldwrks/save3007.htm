<p><b>The Illinois Railway Museum needs your help to save one of America's most hansome and distinctive
steam locomotives: Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy's Hudson number 3007.</b></p>

<p>These 4-6-4s, built by Baldwin Locomotive works in 1930, were designed expressly for
high-speed passenger services.  Bernard G. Corbin, well known historian, described these
locomotives as "the most beautiful and well-proportioned locomotives to polish the rails."
Designed with 78-inch diameter driving wheels, these locomotives were powerful enough to
roll long trains in speeds in excess of 100mph, and were able to be used for longer distances
than their predecessor locomotives.  The Burlington's high speed trains pampered passengers
with on-time, impeccable service, excellent meals and beverages, and some of the most luxurious
accommodations of the time.  Imagine this engine pulling a string of heavyweight Pullman cars
across America's heartland...<i>it could happen again!</i>  It is a long-term goal of the IRM
to restore this locomotive to operation.</p>

<p>The musuem acquired this locomotive at auction in 1995, using funds loaned by members that
are financed against future museum revenues.  In addition, the museum incurred some rather 
extensive charges in moving the locomotive to the IRM, even with the use of IRM motive power for the
move (see the <a href="bn5383.html">article</a> about our U30C retriving the locomotive from
Galesburg, Illinois).</p>
