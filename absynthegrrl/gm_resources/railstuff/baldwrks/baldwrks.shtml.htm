Any company that did not implement the standardization and
bureaucratic centralization characteristic of American System
manufacturing would appear doomed to failure in the highly
competitive Gilded Age business environment, yet the Baldwin
Locomotive Works thrived by deliberately avoiding standardized
mass-production techniques.  In advancing this argument, John
Brown asserts that Baldwin's customized building techniques
forced the company to develop systematic managerial controls
earlier than companies that were able to standardize production.
The author organizes his work topically, exploring such issues as
innovation, management, labor relations, and production methods.

        As a leading producer in the nineteenth-century capital
goods industry, Baldwin experienced periodic peaks and troughs in
locomotive orders.  By the 1850s, furthermore, railroad motive
power officials were demanding significant control over the
development of locomotive technology.  The egotism of many
railroad master mechanics, combined with varied railroad
operating conditions, resulted in demands for a plethora of
locomotive designs.  The size, complexity, and, above all, this
multiplicity of designs rendered standardized mass production
impossible in the steam locomotive industry.

        Baldwin not only survived on this diet of customized
small-batch production; it positively thrived.  Much of this
success resulted from the entrepreneurial abilities of the
company's founder, Matthias Baldwin, as well as from its lack of
a centralized bureaucratic management--for Baldwin, despite its
size, remained a partnership until 1909.  The Baldwin partners
understood that locomotive building was a risky business, and
they diluted this risk by relying on outside suppliers for
capital, by forming financial allegiances with banking houses and
with the railroads themselves, by making extensive use of the
inside contracting system, and by relying on collusion and
price-fixing.

        Baldwin exploited economies of scope, far more than scale
economies.  Particularly during slack periods, the company
solicited foreign business and orders for non-traditional
railroad products, ranging from mine locomotives to elevated
railway equipment--all of which contributed to its non-standard
production.  More important, Baldwin sought to use as many common
parts as possible on its custom-built locomotives.  As a result,
despite offering hundreds of locomotive designs, Baldwin drew
from a vast reservoir of established designs.  By the 1860s,
Baldwin employed a system of jigs, fixtures, and gauges to ensure
standardized production--methods commonly referred to as Armory
Practice, although Brown indicates that Baldwin "seems to have
developed its own variant of these techniques without any direct
transmission from the Armories or other American System
manufactures" (p. 174).  Baldwin also improved production
efficiency by implementing piecework, which, Brown states, caused
little dissent within the ranks of skilled workers.  By
standardizing and systematizing the production of locomotive
components, Baldwin's partners "created new organizational
controls ten to thirty years before their American System
consumer product cousins took up such concerns" (p. 93).

        The "labor question" troubled Baldwin's managers, as it
did their counterparts elsewhere in industrial America.  Baldwin
exhibited a particularly strong sensitivity to this issue,
because varying business cycles called for hiring binges followed
by massive layoffs; yet the technical complexity of steam
locomotives required the company to maintain a cadre of skilled
and loyal workers.  Baldwin succeeded in maintaining peace in an
age of industrial violence through cooperative relations, Brown
argues, and not by coercive threats or regimented Taylorism.  The
company paid consistently high wages and instilled worker loyalty
through a system of apprenticeships.  Of the highly skilled
long-time employees, a select few would become partners, since
Baldwin rarely recruited outside managerial talent.  Since most
of the primary source material that Brown uses in his discussion
of labor issues consists of company statistical data and
managerial correspondence, it is of course difficult to determine
the true degree of worker loyalty; and it is equally difficult to
test the assertion that management saw piece rates as a path to
cooperative, rather than coercive, efficiency.

        Baldwin's skills in responding to varied customer demands
ultimately caused great hardship for the company.  Locomotive
orders peaked in 1906 and, after this date, Baldwin's producer
culture was ill-equipped to respond to a combination of a hostile
regulatory climate and an increasing pace of technological
innovation.  Still, as Brown forcefully argues, for more than
half a century Baldwin's production and managerial innovations
enabled the company to respond effectively to a market that would
not accept mass production.

        This book leaves several tantalizing questions
unanswered.  It is largely beyond the scope of Brown's work, but
an exploration of technological diffusion in relation to the
locomotive industry seems to offer an important topic for future
research.  In a footnote (p. 252), Brown notes that several
employees in the locomotive industry later assumed leadership
roles in the development of other manufacturing industries.
Aside from this reference, and the thorough discussion of links
between railroad master mechanics and technological innovation at
Baldwin, there is little material relating to the impact of
emerging manufacturing technologies on the company and, in turn,
the relationship of Baldwin's technological innovations to other
firms and industries.  Such linkages merit additional
consideration, since Baldwin seems to illustrate a bridge between
the emergence of Armory Practice in the early nineteenth century
and the development of bureaucratized managerial controls over
manufacturing and distribution in high-volume industries during
the 1880s and 1890s.  Also, given the limited managerial
structure at Baldwin, it would be helpful to have more
information regarding the disparate backgrounds and
entrepreneurial outlooks of individual Baldwin partners.

        These minor omissions in no way detract from the
excellence of Brown's work, which adds to the growing number of
valuable correctives to well-known studies of bureaucratically
managed mass-production and -distribution firms.  This study
provides a thorough and well-balanced analysis of the
contributions of an important, although largely neglected, firm
and industry to the development of nineteenth-century
technological and managerial systems.
