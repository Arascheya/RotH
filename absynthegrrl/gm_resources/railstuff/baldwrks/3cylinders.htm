From the book <em>The Locomotives that Baldwin Built</em> by Fred Westing:
<blockquote>

<em>
With the year 1926 came an outstanding event in Baldwin's history, for at
that time the Works was ready to build its sixty-thousandth locomotive. To
symbolize this event President Samuel M. Vauclain planned and built a huge
three-cylinder compound, high-pressure locomotive. It was of the 4-10-2
type and closely resembled engines with this wheel arrangement on the
Southern Pacific Railroad. To safely accommodate the high boiler pressure
of 350 lb. per square inch, a water-tube firebox was used.

Built as a Baldwin demonstrator in 1926, this locomotive was used by
various railroads around the country to show some of Baldwin's latest
ideas.  It was numberd 60000 to commemorate the 60,000th locomotive to be
built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works.  It ran succesfully on either coal
or oil as fuel.  It also attained the highest power ever developed up to
the time on the Altoona test plant, namely, 4,500 horsepower.  This, at the
time, exceeded the plant's capacity and restricted attempts to obtain
greater power with additional tests.  It had several features which made it
unique:
<ul>
<li>It had a watertube firebox.
<li>It had three cylinders.
<li>It used compound steam expansion.
</ul>
<blockquote>
NOTE:  If you look carefully under the smokebox front, you will see the
center high-pressure cylinder and steam chest.  This cylinder is angled
downwards to the back.  The piston is connected via a crank to the second
set of drivers.
</blockquote>
The numbers 60000 appear on the cab side, and on the number boards and
headlight of the engine.  The tender lettering reads THE BALDWIN LOCOMOTIVE
WORKS. The tender is a Vanderbilt with a short coal space and 6-wheel
trucks.  Here are a few more specifications on the 60000:
<ul>
<li>Wheel arrangement: 4-10-2
<li>Cylinders: High pressure (1) 27x32 inches
<li>Cylinders: Low pressure (2) 27x32 inches
<li>Boilder diameter: 84 inches
<li>Steam pressure: 350 psi
<li>Driver diameter: 63.5 inches
<li>Weight on drivers: 338,400 lbs
<li>Total engine weight: 457,500 lbs
<li>Total engine & tender weight: 700,900 lbs
<li>Tractive force: 82,500 lbs
</ul>

Although there were not any serious problems with it, the railroads
rejected it because they found it overly heavy and complex and were wary of
most of its features.  Also, the 4-8-4 was quickly becoming the ideal
high-speed, heavy freight and passenger locomotive.  With only 100,000
miles on it (very little for a steam locomotive), it was returned to
Philadelphia in 1928 and stored until 1932 when it was donated to the <a
href="http://sln.fi.edu/">Franklin Institute Science Museum</a> in
Philadelphia, PA.  It is on display there today in the basement on a short
piece of track.  A hydraulic system is used to move the locomotive back and
forth about ten feet.

<h2>Union Pacific 4-12-2 Number 9000</h2>
<p>
9000 had two outside 27"x32" cylinders driving the third set of drive
wheels and a third 27"x31" cylinder in the center driving the second
axle.  The first axle also had a crank in the center to provide clearance
for the connecting rod of the center cylinder.  It had 67 inch drivers.
The forth set of drivers did not have flanges.  However, this was later
proven unneccessary because of the lateral motion devices on the first
and last pair of drivers.
<p>
The UP 9000s had the longest rigid wheelbase of all steam locomotives in
the United States.  However, there were a few other countries with equally
impressive locomotives.  Bulgaria and two groups of 2-12-4Ts, Indonesia had
a few 2-12-2Ts.  Russia built one 4-14-4.  It made one demonstration run
during which it tore the track apart; it was stored and later scrapped.
<h2>Southern Pacific 4-10-2 Number 5021</h2>
<p>
This is the only surviving Southern Pacific three cylinder 4-10-2 (out of
49).  The first of this type was built in 1925 by ALCO.  The Southern
Pacific named this wheel arrangement after their own name (Southern
Pacific).  The Union Pacific also had locomotives (10) of this wheel
arrangement (none survived).  They named them "Overlands".  This locomotive
has 63 inch drivers.  With its three cylinders, it could develop 4,100 HP.
Its top speed was 60 MPH.  They were used for both freight and passenger
service over Donner Pass, until it was determined that they were too rigid
for the curves there.  5021 is in excellent condition.
