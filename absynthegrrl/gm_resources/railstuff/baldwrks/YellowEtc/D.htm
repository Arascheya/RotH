<a href="D194.htm"><b><H3> 2-8-0 #194    </a>    Locomotives were easy to observe at Two Harbors  as the Rail yards are 

<a href="D1219.htm"><b> 2-8-0 #1219  </a></b> bordered by a public park.  Good photography , however, was a bit more  

<a href="D1107.htm"><b> 4-6-2 #1107  </a></b> difficult as plain clothes railroad men policed the area and immediately 

<a href="D1306.htm"><b> 2-8-2 #1306  </a></b> apprehended anyone who even looked as though he was going to set foot on  

<a href="D503.htm"><b> 2-10-2 #503  </a></b> railroad property to get a closer shot.  They were very polite but very 

<a href="D710.htm"><b> 2-10-4 #710  </a></b> adamant about not allowing anyone to cross onto Railroad property.

<a href="D711.htm"><b> 2-10-4 #711  </a></b>      Proctor was another matter.  As the public was not close by the 

<a href="D220.htm"><b> 2-8-8-4 #220 </a></b> round house, no one policed the area and if one wore bib overalls

<a href="D222.htm"><b> 2-8-8-4 #222 </a></b> (preferably reasonably worn and not spotlessly clean), and topped

<a href="D227.htm"><b> 2-8-8-4 #227 </a></b> the whole thing off with a hard hat, it made you more or less

<a href="D233.htm"><b> 2-8-8-4 #233 </a></b> invisible and you could move about at will, either inside or out in the 

<a href="D91.htm"><b> 0-10-0 #91   </a></b> yards where you could get whatever photo angle you wished.

<a href="D607.htm"><b> 0-10-2 #607  </a></b>            The Locomotives in ready storage were spotlessly maintained.

<a href="D1323.htm"><b> 2-8-2 #1323  </a></b>      Most of them looked as though they had just left the paint shop 

<a href="D507.htm"><b> 2-10-2 #507  </a></b>      within the last 15 minutes.  The only things they lacked were the

<a href="D711_1.htm"><b> 2-10-4 #711/#707</a></b> sights, sounds, smells, and warm feelings of a hot engine

<a href="D209.htm"><b> 2-8-8-2 #209 </a></b>      ready to go.

<B><H2>Locomotives in Dead Storage</H2></B>

<a href="D88.htm"><b> 0-8-0 #88    </a></b>       Locomotives in dead storage looked much like dead locomotives

<a href="D193.htm"><b> 2-8-0 #193   </a></b>  on any other railroad.  Missing parts, parts hanging loose, and rust 

<a href="D400.htm"><b> 4-6-2 #400   </a></b>  were evident on most of them.  Although most were obviously ready

<a href="D202.htm"><b> 2-8-8-2 #202 </a></b>  for scrapping, it is possible that a few were waiting to be re-shopped.
