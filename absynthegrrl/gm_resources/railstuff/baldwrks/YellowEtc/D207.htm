<b><h1><font face="arial">Duluth,Missabe, And Iron Range, Class "M", 2-8-2 #207</h1></b>
<font face="arial">


<b><h4><font face="arial">Taken Procter, Minn. May 28, 1952.</h4></b>

<b><h3>Originally #207 Duluth, Missabe and Northern Ry. Built by Baldwin, 1910, C/N 35167.
</h3></b>

<b><h3> D.M.& I.R. retained #207.

 It was modernized  with a top mounted Elesco feedwater heater, Mechanical Stoker and Superheater circa 1916. In 1930 it was simpled by replacing the 40" Low pressure cylinders on the front engine with a  pair of 24" x 32" cylinders and sleeving the rear cylinders down from 26" to 24".   Top mounted Air Reservoirs,  and front mounted Air pumps gave the  engine a much more modern appearance.  Frank Kings book "Locomotives of the Duluth, Missabe, & Iron Range" has a beautiful shot of #207 in its glory on page 128.  By 1952 it was waiting on a storage track at Proctor for either rebuilding or scrapping.  It did not get a new lease on life.  Within a year after this photo was taken, #207 met the scrappers torch.
