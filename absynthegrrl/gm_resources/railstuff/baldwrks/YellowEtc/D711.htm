<b><h4><font face="arial">Taken Proctor, Minn. May, 28, 1952.</h4></b>
<b><h3>On the ready track, prepared to hold back a train of loaded ore cars going down the 2.2% grade to the Duluth ore docks and return the emptys, several times during its shift.  Built by Baldwin,c/n 64154 in 1941 for the Bessemer and Lake Erie RR. as #635.  In 1951, it, along with the rest of B&LE's 2-10-4's, was shifted to DM&IR where it was classified E-5 and renumbered #711.   DM&IR,B&LR, Union, and EJ&E railroads were all owned by U.S.Steel inc. so shifting all steam to one railroad, which already had excellent steam shopping facilities, made a lot of sense as U.S.Steel gradually Dieselized.</h3></b>
