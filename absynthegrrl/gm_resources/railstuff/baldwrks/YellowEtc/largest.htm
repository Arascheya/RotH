<h1 align="center">The Best and Largest of Steam</h1>

<p> Often discussions come up about about which steam locomotive was the largest, or which
steam locomotive was the most powerful. These questions are difficult to answer without
qualification. This document will attempt to answer some of these questions. You will find
two sections below: the first is about the &quot;largest&quot; steam locomotives. The
second is about the &quot;best&quot; steam locomotives, </p>

<h2>What was the largest steam locomotive?</h2>

<p>What do you mean? Longest? Heaviest? Most wheels? Most HP? In the United States only? </p>

<p>You see, this is a hard question to answer (as it is written). When comparing steam
locomotives, you really need to be specific as to what you're looking for. For example, an
easier question to answer would be: &quot;What was the longest, non-articulated steam
locomotive in the US?&quot;. </p>

<p>I am going to try to answer some of these questions by category. I don't have
specifications for all U.S. steam locomotives, so I'm almost certain that I have missed
something. If you see any omissions, <a href="file://C:\temp\largest.htm/~wes/email.html">let
me know</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <strong><p>§ NOTE:</strong> Comparing the horsepower of various steam locomotives can be
  a difficult thing to do. One of the reasons for this is that on a steam locomotive there
  are several ways to measure horsepower (drawbar horsepower, indicated or cylinder
  horsepower, and calculated horsepower). Also, drawbar horsepower is measured with a
  dynamometer car where the firing rate and track gradient may effect the results. Often,
  books do not specify which figures they are quoting. It is also important to know that the
  horsepower rating of steam locomotives just wasn't as important as their tractive effort
  rating. This is because for most steam locomotives, the limiting factor was how much
  tonnage a locomotive could move from a standing start (tractive effort). In general, if a
  steam locomotive can get a train rolling, it could pull it at an efficient speed. For
  diesels, the opposite is true. Most any diesel can generate enough tractive effort to get
  a train rolling, however, a smaller diesel engine may not be able to pull it very fast. </p>

<h3>But I Thought the <a href="bigboys.htm">Big Boy</a> was the Largest!</h3>

<p>You may have noticed that UPs Big Boys did not &quot;win&quot; any of the above
categories. Many books will cite that the Big Boy is the &quot;largest&quot; steam
locomotive ever built. Why is this? </p>

<p>Even though the Big Boys did not &quot;win&quot; any of the categories listed above, it
always &quot;placed&quot;. If you were to eliminate all of the unsuccessful and test
locomotives from the above list and then look at the overall rating of the Big Boys in the
above categories, it becomes clear that the Big Boy was the &quot;largest&quot; among all
successful steam locomotives. </p>

<h3>What is Tractive Effort?</h3>

<p>Tractive effort was a theoretical quantity. Railroads preferred it to HP ratings
because HP involved a time quantity which was determined, in part, by how well the
locomotive was being fired (among many other variables). Tractive effort, on the other
hand, was determined by the geometry of the locomotive only. Tractive effort can be
determined by the following equation: </p>

<pre>          c P (d)^2 s
     TE = -----------
               D</pre>

<p>TE = tractive effort in lbs<br>
c = mean effective pressure (usually 85%)<br>
P = boiler pressure<br>
d = piston diameter<br>
s = piston stroke<br>
D = driver diameter<br>
</p>

<p>Using the above equation with specifications for a Big Boy yields:<br>
Boiler pressure: 300 lbs<br>
Cylinders: 2x 23.75x32 inches<br>
Drivers: 68 inch </p>

<pre>          .85 300 2(23.75)^2 32
     TE = --------------------- = 135,375 lbs
                   68</pre>

<h2>Which were the best steam locomotives?</h2>

<p>The following list only shows my opinions. You may or may not agree. </p>

<h3>The Best Pacific (4-6-2)</h3>

<p>Pennsylvania's K-4 Pacific was probably one of the most successful American locomotives
of all time. 425 of them were built between 1914 and 1927. An indication of the great
respect the Pennsy had for this locomotive is the fact that one of her type was selected
as the railroad's monument to its steampower at the famous Horseshoe Curve. This
locomotive has since been moved to the Conrail Shops (RRers Memorial Museum) in Altoona,
PA. </p>

<h3>The Best Hudson (4-6-4)</h3>

<p>Most Hudsons were of roughly the same design. New York Central had the greatest number
of Hudsons by far. The class J-1 and J-3a Hudsons of 1927 had 79 inch drivers. They were
fast, powerful, very well proportioned (good looking) and may have been the best known
steam locomotive. </p>

<p>Also worth mentioning are the Milwaukee Hudsons of 1937. They had 84 inch drivers and
were streamlined. They were used to pull the &quot;Hiawatha&quot;. </p>

<h3>The Best Mikado (2-8-2)</h3>

<p>The class O-8 Mikados of the Great Northern are the easy winners of this type. Built in
1932 by the Great Northern, they were by far the heaviest, fastest, and most powerful of
this wheel arrangement. They were arguably the best looking too. Because of their 69 inch
drivers and large boilers, their pulling capabilities were in the same league with the
NYC&amp;StL Berkshires and some Northerns. </p>

<h3>The Best Berkshire (2-8-4)</h3>

<p>Lima introduced the 2-8-4 wheel arrangement in 1925. Erie improved this design by using
slightly larger cylinders and larger (70&quot;) drivers making a fast and large 2-8-4. The
Nickel Plate (NYC&amp;StL) further improved the design by starting with a C&amp;O T-1,
removing one set of drivers, and applying characteristics of the Erie Berkshires.
NYC&amp;StL called this class S-1. This same successful design was used for a number of
roads including: </p>

<p>Pere Marquette<br>
Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie<br>
Chesapeake &amp; Ohio<br>
Virginian<br>
Richmond Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac<br>
</p>

<h3>The Best Mountain (4-8-2)</h3>

<p>Originally designed for passenger service through the mountains, the Mountain type
became a fast dual-service locomotive. The New York Central called them Mohawks. The
Mohawks (class L-3) of 1940 had lightweight rods and 69 inch disk drivers. This provided
better counter balancing than most and helped the Mohawks to cruise at 80 MPH. </p>

<h3>The Best Northern (4-8-4)</h3>

<p>This is a tough one. The reason this category is hard to pick is because for many
railroads, the Northern was the ultimate and most modern fast freight and passenger
locomotive. Most Northerns were well designed, modern engines. Perhaps a few stand out
though: 

<dl>
  <dt>Norfolk &amp; Western J </dt>
  <dd>The most modern, most powerful, and strongest of all Northerns (built as late as 1950) </dd>
  <dt>Southern Pacific GS (Golden State class, later General Service) </dt>
  <dd>Arguably the best looking streamlined steam locomotives </dd>
  <dt>Union Pacific FEF-3 </dt>
  <dd>Built to cruise at over 100 MPH </dd>
  <dt>Sante Fe 2900 class </dt>
  <dd>Heaviest and longest Northerns </dd>
</dl>

<h3>The Best Sante Fe (2-10-2)</h3>

<p>The B&amp;O &quot;Big Sixes&quot; were an exception to the normal 2-10-2
&quot;drag&quot; locomotives. The &quot;Big Sixes&quot; (class S-1) were powerful and
faster than the other 2-10-2s. Built in 1923, they had large 64 inch drivers and were used
as fast freight engines. They carried long Vanderbilt tenders. They were called &quot;Big
Sixes&quot; because their engine numbers were in the 6000s. </p>

<h3>The Best Texas (2-10-4)</h3>

<p>The &quot;best&quot; 2-10-4 has to be the C&amp;O T-1s built in 1930 by Lima. Most
2-10-4s were built as &quot;drag&quot; engines with smaller drivers. The smaller drivers
made it difficult to balance the weight of the side rods and valve gear. Running at higher
speeds was not done with earlier 2-10-4s. Unlike most other 2-10-4s, the T-1s were
powerful _and_ fast. The T-1s had 69 inch drivers. C&amp;O basically took an Erie
Berkshire and stretched it into a 2-10-4. </p>

<p>Another class of 2-10-4s worth mentioning were the T-1-b class of 1938 used by the
Canadian Pacific. The ten locomotives of this class were semi-streamlined and used for
passenger service through the Rockies. The CP called them &quot;Selkirks&quot;. </p>
