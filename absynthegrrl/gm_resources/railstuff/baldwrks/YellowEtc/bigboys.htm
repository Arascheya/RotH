<h2>Who designed the Big Boys?</h2>
During the late 1930s, the <a href="http://www.uphs.org/">Union Pacific</a>
often used helpers to move trains
from Ogden to Wasatch.  The UP wanted to simplify this move so they asked
their "Department of Research and Mechanical Standards" to design a
locomotive that could pull a 3600 ton train unassisted over the 1.14% grade
of the Wasatch.
<p>
The designers determined that to pull a 3600 ton train, a tractive effort
of 135,000 lbs would be needed.  Assuming a factor of adhesion of 4.0, the
weight on drivers would have to be 4.0 * 135,000 = 540,000 lbs.  Given an
axle loading of 67,500 lbs each, this would require 8 drivers or an x-8-8-x
wheel arrangement.  The designers agreed upon the 4-8-8-4 design.  Next,
the horsepower and cylinder sizes were computed based on 300 psi boiler
pressure.  Although they weren't planning to pull these freight trains at
80 MPH, the DoRMS designed them for 80 MPH in order to have a sufficient
factor of safety built into the design.  What resulted is considered by
many to be the most successful articulated steam locomotive ever built.
4000 was delivered to Omaha at 6PM, September 5, 1941.
<blockquote>
<strong>NOTE</strong>:  Periodically, I hear the Big Boy refered to as
a "Mallet".  Technically, this is not true.  Anatole Mallet designed
his steam locomotive that 1) was articulated, and 2) used compound expansion
(high and low pressure cylinders).  The Big Boys, as well as many other
articulated steam locomotives, used simple expansion, and thus, are not
true mallets.

<h2>Why are they considered the largest?</h2>

When steam locomotives are compared, many different quantities can be
considered.  For example, weight, length, horsepower, and tractive effort
are all characteristics of how "large" a steam locomotive is.  In each of
the above categories, a locomotive "<a
href="../misc/largest.html">larger</a>" than a Big Boy can be found.
However, if one could somehow combine all of these characteristics into a
formula which could be used to compute the "largeness" of a locomotive, the
Big Boy would most certainly win.

<blockquote>
<strong>NOTE</strong>:  The sharpest curve the Big Boys could negotiate was
a 20 degree curve.  In HO scale, this would be a 40 inch radius curve.

<h2>When did they roam the rails?</h2>
The 25 Big Boys were built in two groups.  The first group, called "class
1", were built starting in 1941.  They were numbered 4000-4019.  The second
group, "class 2", were built starting in 1945.  They were numbered
4020-4024.  The last revenue freight pulled by a Big Boy was in July of
1959.  Most were retired in 1961.  The last one was retired in July of
1962.  As late as September, 1962, there were still four operational Big
Boys at Green River, WY.
<img src="/Images/Bars/hr_thblu.gif">
<h2>How many miles did they accumulate?</h2>
The total mileage of each of the Big Boys from class 1 were roughly the
same -- 1,000,000 miles.  4016 had the lowest mileage -- 1,016,124.  4006
had the highest mileage -- 1,064,625.  Of the second group, 4024 had the
highese mileage -- 811,956.

<h2>Where are the surviving Big Boys?</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>4004: Holliday Park, Cheyenne, WY</strong><p>
<a href="../colorado/up4004a.jpg"><img src="../colorado/up4004a-button.jpg" align=left border=0></a>
<a href="../colorado/up4004b.jpg"><img src="../colorado/up4004b-button.jpg" align=left hspace=14 border=0></a>
<p>

4004 is displayed in Holliday Park on US 30 in Cheyenne.  Cheyenne is also
the home of UP's steam program where both Challenger 3985 and Northern 844
(and a few others) are housed.  The Elesco cold water turbine pump was
removed from 4004 for use on Challenger 3985.  I understand that there was
a flood in Holliday park a few years ago and 4004 was partially under
water!  From the exterior, 4004 looks to be in good shape.

<p>
<li><strong>4005: Forney Transportation Museum, Denver, CO</strong><p>
<a href="../colorado/up4005.jpg"><img src="../colorado/up4005-button.jpg" align=left hspace=14 border=0></a>
<p>
4005 is displayed at the Forney Transportation Museum in Denver.  At the
end of its career, 4005 had been partially dismantled for shipment to
Argentina.  However, the recipients in Argentina could not raise enough
money so 4005 stayed.  4005 was also the Big Boy which was unsuccessfully
converted to burning oil (and then converted back to burning coal).  Notice
the red firebox on this Big Boy.  I don't know why it is painted red.  4005
looks to be in fair to poor condition.
<p>
<li><strong>4006: Museum of Transportation, St. Louis, MO</strong><p>
<a href="4006.jpg"><img src="4006-button.jpg" align=left hspace=14 border=0></a>
4006 was painted in 1995 and is displayed directly ahead of UP
<a href="../misc/Centennials.html">Centennial</a> 6944.  Stairs provide access
to the cab where most controls are identified.

<li><strong>4012: Steamtown National Historic Site, Scranton, PA</strong><p>
<a href="../steamtown/up4012.jpg"><img src="../steamtown/up4012-button.jpg" align=left hspace=14 border=0></a>
<p>
For many years, 4012 was displayed in the front of the Lackawanna Station
Hotel in downtown Scranton.  In 1993 after bridges between the Hotel and
Steamtown were replaced, 4012 was moved into the yard at Steamtown.
Contrary to a rumor posted a while back on rec.railroad, Steamtown has no
plans to partially restore 4012 to working order.
<p>
<li><strong>4014: Los Angeles County Fairplex, Pomona, CA</strong><p>
<a href="../losangeles/up4014.jpg"><img src="../losangeles/up4014-button.jpg" align=left hspace=14 border=0></a>
<p>
Of all the Big Boys I have seen, 4014 is in the best condition.  It was
donated to the Southern California Chapter of the Railway & Locomotive
Historical Society in January, 1962.  The cab interior gives the
impression that all it needs is coal and a fire and it will come to life.

<li><strong>4017: National Railroad Museum, Green Bay, WI</strong><p>
<a href="4017.jpg"><img src="4017-button.jpg" align=left hspace=14 border=0></a>

<a href="ftp://plains.uwyo.edu/BIGBOY/bigboy2.gif">4017</a> is in good to
very good cosmetic shape.  Whe was sand blasted and repainted in 1995.  The
firebox is lighted and viewable by the public.  There is still some rust
here and there, but the museum is starting a capital program to get all its
steam locomotives under roof, hopefully within the next five years.

<li><strong>4018: <a href="http://www.startext.net/homes/railroad/">Age of Steam Railroad Museum</a>, Dallas, TX</strong><p>
<a href="4018.jpg"><img src="4018-button.jpg" align=left hspace=14 border=0></a>

Of all the Big Boys I have seen, from the outside, 4018 appears to be in the
worst condition.  The main reason I say this is because when I saw it, I
noticed that the piston rods had been severed by a cutting torch.  This was
done by the Union Pacific when they moved 4018 to the museum back in the late
60s.  Also, the boiler jacketing and much of the piping looked to be in pretty
rough shape.  I did not photograph 4018 because it was a dark rainy day when
I visited the Age of Steam Railroad Museum plus because of how the
locomotives were parked, it would have been difficult to get a good shot.

<p>

In April, 1998 a <a href="4018.html">story indicating that 4018 may be
restored to operating condition</a> was circulating.

<li><strong>4023: Kenefick Park, Omaha, NE</strong><p>
<a href="4023b.jpg"><img src="4023-button.jpg" align=left hspace=14 border=0></a>

During the end of their careers (1956, I believe) both Challenger 3985 and Big
Boy 4023 were given general overhauls so that they could continue to run for a
few more years.  In 1957, they were placed in storage in the Cheyenne UP
roundhouse.  However, 4023 was later put on display in Kenefick Park (along
with Centennial 6900) in Omaha and the weather and environment has taken its
toll on 4023.

<br clear="all">
<a href="upround.jpg"><img src="upround-button.jpg" align=left hspace=14 border=0></a>

Here is a very rare photo of both 3985 and 4023 after they were overhauled,
repainted, retired, and stored in the Cheyenne roundhouse.  My guess is
that this photo was taken sometime in 1957.

<h2>Will a Big Boy ever be restored to operating condition?</h2>
This question comes up frequently.  If restoration were to be attempted, it
would make most sense to start with the Big Boy that is in the best
condition.  At one time, this would have been 4023, currently at Kenefick
Park, Omaha, NE.  During the end of their careers both Challenger 3985 and
Big Boy 4023 were rebuilt and placed in the Cheyenne UP roundhouse.
However, 4023 was later displayed in Omaha and the weather and environment
has taken its toll on 4023.  Currently, 4014, displayed in Pomona, CA has
been kept in immaculate condition by the Southern California Chapter of the
Railway & Locomotive Historical Society.  Today, it would make most sense
to start with this one.
<p>
However, according to many sources, the UP is loathe to run a coal-fired
locomotive on their road any longer (the 3985 (4-6-6-4) was converted to
oil in the late 1980's).  Naturally, the next question one asks is "why not
convert a Big Boy to oil?".  This was tried, in fact, back in the 1940's or
1950's on 4005, without success.  It is not feasible to fire a Big Boy with oil,
due to the nature of the firebox and boiler capacity.
<p>
Steve Lee (head of UP's steam program) has also stated that it wouldn't
make much sense for UP to restore a Big Boy, as there are only two places
on the entire system that are large enough to turn a Big Boy, and those
places are only a few miles apart.
