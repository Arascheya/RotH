Cab Forwards were a distinct trademark of the Southern Pacific.  They were
sometimes also called "Cab-in-fronts" or "Backup Mallies" (even though,
technically, only some of the first classes were true mallets).  According
to the diffinitive book on Cab Forwards, no other railroad in the world had
locomotives like them.  However, a <a href="#other">few other</a> unique
examples did exist.

<h2>Why Cab Forwards?</h2>

The Sacramento division of the Southern Pacific had close to 150 miles of
grades of up to 2.5%.  On this Roseville - Sparks line over the Sierra Nevada
there were also almost 30 miles of
snow sheds and tunnels.  Over the years, as trains grew in length, more powerful
locomotives were required.

In 1908 the Southern Pacific ordered two 2-8-8-2 mallets classified MC-1
(Mallet - Consolidation) numbered 4000 and 4001.  On a trial run up the
"Hill" two problems became immediately evident.  First, the great volume of
exhaust gasses almost asphyxiated the crew.  Second, the stack exhaust
velocity was so great that it blew the roof boards off of the snow sheds.
The second problem was easily handled by installing "stack splitters" (a
deflector located above the smoke stack which directed the exhaust to the
sides), as shown at the top of the image on the right.  The first problem
required more consideration.

<p>


A team of Southern Pacific design engineers came up with a plan and designs for
a mallet with the cab in front, classified MC-2.  Southern Pacific had Baldwin
build 15 without testing one!  Numbered 4002-4016, they were delivered in
February and March of 1910.  The engineer's and fireman's controls were
shifted to opposite sides of the cab so that when run "backwards" the crew was
on the usual side of the track.

<p>

After the MC-2s had proven themselves, 32 more, classified MC-4 and MC-6 (MC-3
and MC-5 were skipped) were ordered.  Before it was all over, Southern Pacific
ended up with a total of 256 Cab Forwards (all classes).

Although the crews initially complained about concerns that if they hit a
gasoline truck at a grade crossing they would be right on top of it when it
exploded.  Fortunately, in 46 years of running Cab Forwards, this never
happened.  This was partially because of the unobstructed view from the
cab.  The advantage in visibility was tremendous.

<h2>Southern Pacific Yellowstones</h2>

Not all Southern Pacific articulateds were Cab Forwards.  Class AC-9 was made
up of 12 Lima built <em>Superpower</em>, coal burning Yellowstones (2-8-8-4).
They had the same tractive effort of the Cab Forwards.  They were numbered 3800
- 3811 and were used in the Southwest.

<h2>The <em>Monkey Deck</em></h2>

<img src="monkeydeck.gif" alt="Monkey Deck" align="right">

Occasionally articulateds would spew hot water and mud from their stacks.
Smoke boxes were often stained with rust from boiler water and boiler water
treatment chemicals.  The <em>monkey deck</em> is the platform immediately
after the smokebox of a Cab Forward, as shown in the figure on the right.
Because of its proximity to the stacks, the <em>monkey deck</em> was often
stained with rust from boiler water too.  Most railroad employees were
aware of this fact.  However, many hoboes thought the <em>monkey deck</em>
was a good place to ride.  After passing through tunnels or snow sheds,
hoboes riding the deck were either scalded or asphyxiated depending upon
how the locomotive was performing.

<h2>Other Cab Forwards</h2>

<h3>German</h3>

There was one cab forward in service in Germany.  It was different from the
SP cab forwards in that it was not articulated.  Only one was built as one
of the 05-series steamers. There were only 3 05s built around 1935-36. They
were designed for high speed and were all streamlined 3-cylinder pacifics.
Another distinction was that they were painted red.  In 1936 05-002 set a
world speed record for steamers with 200.4 km/h only to be surpassed one or
two years later by Mallard with 204 km/h (I believe).  One of the three 05s
(05-003) was designed as a cab forward and as another oddity it was fueled
by coal dust. After WWII 05-003 was rebuilt into a traditional steamer
(stripped of the streamlining and the cab moved to the back) and was in
service until 1958 when it was scrapped together with 05-002.  In 1958, in
need of boiler repairs, 05-001 was taken out of service and refitted with
its streamline shell before being moved to the Transportation Museum in
Nuremberg.  It looks as if in top shape, but it is not in operating
condition.

<h3>Italian</h3>

<a href="mucca.jpg"><img src="mucca-button.jpg" alt="Gruppo 670" border=0 align="left"></a>

The Italians also had a class of cab forwards, the Gruppo 670, late Gr.671
(43 were built), which were 4-6-0s with a six wheel tender for water only.
The coal was carried in a bunker above and alongside the firebox.  The
engines were four cylinder Plancher compounds and hauled passenger trains
down the east coast of Italy. There was also a single Gr 672 built that was
similar, but was used to try out the Franco system of pre-heating the feed
water.  All the above engines were affectionately known by their crews as
"Muccas" (Cows!).

<p>
<!--p align="center">

</p-->

There was also a class of four cylinder 0-10-0s, also Planchers, built for
banking duties north out of Genoa that were Tank engines with the coal
supply located as on the Gr 670, but all their water supply was carried in
four wheel tenders that could be positioned at either end of the engine, so
that sometimes they too were cab forwards.  They were originally designed
like that because of legislation that decreed that between loco and train
there had to be an empty wagon, which wasn't helpful on steeply graded
lines so the "tender" sufficed.  Most of these were eventually converted to
conventional tender engines, but 470.092 survived in original condition in
the Science Museum in Milan.
