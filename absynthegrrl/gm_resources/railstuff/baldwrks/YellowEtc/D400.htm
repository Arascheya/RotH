<b><h3>While D.& I.R. got along with only 4 Pacifics for passenger service, Duluth Missabe and Northern had only 3.  #400-402 were built by Baldwin, 1913, C/N 39877-79.  They were slightly heavier than the D.& I.R. "A's" with larger cylinders and more tractive force.  Standing on the storage tracks across the turntable from the round house in apparent working order  with extra flags still flying, it was not clear whether #400 had reached the end of her working days or was merely resting while waiting scheduled maintenance.
