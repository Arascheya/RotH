<h1>Steam Locomotive Design</h1>

<p>Try designing your own steam locomotive. True steam locomotive design is an art
(getting a locomotive that is not too slippery, one that will fit through clearances,
having the correct horsepower for the terrain and loads it will have to pull, etc.).
However, that doesn't prevent us from having some fun with a few of the important
parameters that are used in steam locomotive design. </p>

<p>Below are few examples of existing steam locomotive designs. Try entering one of these
or one of your own. (http://www.arc.umn.edu/~wes/steam.html)</p>
