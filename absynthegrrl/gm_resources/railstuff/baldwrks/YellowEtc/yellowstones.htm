Of all steam locomotives which survive today, which one(s) had the greatest
pulling force?  The Union Pacific Big Boys?  Nope.  Of all surviving steam
locomotives, the ones that were able to generate the greatest tractive
effort would be the Duluth Missabe &amp; Iron Range Yellowstones!  Only 72
Yellowstones were built (in five different classes).  They were owned by
the roads listed in the table below.

<p>

Each class of Yellowstone was a different design (except for the two
classes owned by the DM&amp;IR).  The design was usually dictated by the
specific needs of the railroad that received them.

<p>

<h3>Northern Pacific class Z-5</h3>

<a href="np5000.jpg"><img src="np5000-button.jpg" border=0 align="left"></a>

The first Yellowstone was built in 1928 by Alco for the Northern Pacific
for running throughout the high speed planes of North Dakota.  It would
turn out to be the one and only Yellowstone that Alco would build.

<p>

NP wanted to burn low-grade Rosebud coal (obtained from mines along the
line) in their locomotives.  This required the Yellowstone to be designed
with a huge (the largest ever used on a steam locomotive) firebox (182 sq.
ft.).  The front half of the firebox was over the two rear pairs of
drivers, and the trailing truck (which was equipped with a booster).

<p>

It was the largest steam locomotive in the world (at that time) and Alco
celebrated by serving dinner to 12 people seated in the firebox!  NP asked
for bids for 11 more like it, and Baldwin got the job in 1930.  The NP
Yellowstones steamed poorly and produced less that 5,000 HP.  NP found that
the grates were simply too large to maintain a high temperature and
complete combustion.  The combustion problem was solved by blocking off The
front two feet of the firebox on each locomotive.

<h3>Southern Pacific class AC-9</h3>

<a href="sp3800.jpg"><img src="sp3800-button.jpg" border=0 align="left"></a>

Most of Southern Pacifics "big steam" were of the <a
href="../cabforward/">Cab Forward</a> design (a backwards Yellowstone).
However, not all of the SP "big steam" was required to run through the snow
sheds of the Sierras.  In 1939 the SP received 12 Yellowstones from Lima
for use throughout the southern part of the SP system.  Unlike the Cab
Forwards, the class AC-9 locomotives were coal burners.  With their skyline
casings and striped cowcatcher-pilots, they could almost be considered
streamlined.  They were retired between 1953 and 1956.  The photo was taken
near Tucumcari, NM on May 11, 1940 by Richard H. Kindig.

<h3>Duluth, Missabe &amp; Iron Range classes M-3 and M-4</h3>

In the late 1930s the DM&amp;IR was in need of new locomotives that would
be able to handle 115-car, 8750-ton trains over .62% grades without
stalling.  Western Pacific 2-8-8-2 was used as a basis for its design.  The
larger cab required a longer and heavier frame, therefore a 4-wheel
trailing truck was used.  Roller bearings were used on all locomotive and
tender axles.  The DM&amp;IR was the only road who chose to use "pedestal"
or "centipede" tenders with their Yellowstones.

<p>

DM&amp;IR was pleased with the first batch (class M-3) of 8 received from
Baldwin in 1941 so they ordered 10 duplicates (class M-4).  They were
completed late in the year in 1943 after much of DM&amp;IR's traffic had
subsided, so some of the M-4s were leased by and delivered directly to the
Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western.  The following winter the D&amp;RGW again
borrowed the 2-8-8-4s for use as helpers over the 10,239-foot Tennessee
Pass crossing of the continental Divide.  The D&amp;RGW sent a telegram to
the DM&amp;IR stating that the Yellowstones were the finest steam
locomotives to ever operate on its road.

<p>

On the DM&amp;IR they were used to pull ore trains throughout the Duluth
area.  For the most part, ore trains had to be pulled downhill to the ore
docks on Lake Superior in Duluth and Two Harbors.  These trips did not
require the enormous pulling force of the Yellowstones.  Surprisingly, the
limiting factor (as far as what the iron range locomotives could pull) was
the 2.2 percent grade from Duluth up to the yards in Proctor.  The ore cars
had to be returned empty to these yards for sorting.  It was the task of
returning ore cars up this hill where these Yellowstones worked their
hardest.  They were retired between 1958 and 1963.

<a href="dmir221.jpg"><img src="dmir221-button.jpg" border=0 align="left"></a>

Yellowstone #221 was displayed for many years near the ore docks in the
city of Two Harbors, MN.  By the late 1960s, the locomotive was showing
signs of severe decay.  In 1969, #221 was scrapped.  <small>See
229.</small>

comes to grips with front end of Missabe Road 224 at Fireclay, CO after
runaway while in Rio Grande employ.  Looks pretty rough, doesn't it.

M-3 225 leads a railfan excursion across a DM&amp;IR trestle near Holman
Junction in the late 1950s.  Today 225 is on display in Proctor, MN.

<a href="dmir225p.jpg"><img src="dmir225p-button.jpg" border=0 align="left"></a>

Proctor is a few miles west of Duluth and the site of a large railroad
yard.  In 1995 225 had all of the boiler jacketing removed giving it this
"white" appearance.  This will probably extend its life on display as
moisture will not be trapped against the boiler.  Since the time this photo
was taken, 225 has been painted and is looking pretty nice.

<a href="dmir227.jpg"><img src="dmir227-button.jpg" border=0 align="left"></a>

Yellowstone 227 is on display inside the Lake Superior Transportation
Museum.  As a result, it is difficult to get a decent photograph of her.
This postcard was taken years ago when she was still outside.  Today, her
driving wheels are supported slightly above the railheads.  An electric
motor is used to spin her wheels slowly so that you can see the motion of
the massive valve gear.  Of the three surviving Yellowstones, 227 is
probably in the best shape.

In the Two Harbors roundhouse (which still stands today) another
Yellowstone was waiting to take 221s place.  In 1969, this Yellowstone,
#229 was brought out to replace #221.  A small shed was built over 229 to
help protect her from the weather.

<a href="dmir232.jpg"><img src="dmir232-button.jpg" border=0 align="left"></a>

Here 232 is shown waiting to be scrapped.  A row of centipede tenders
detached from their locomotives, yet still full of coal, is on the right.
Oddly, the first tender belongs to 227.  Perhaps 227 was rescued from
the scrappers only shortly before the end.

<h3>Baltimore &amp; Ohio class EM-1</h3>
<a href="bo7602.jpg"><img src="bo7602-button.jpg" border=0 align="left"></a>

The EM-1s were the last articulated steam locomotives built for the
B&amp;O.  Actually, the B&amp;O did not want the EM-1s.  Instead they
wanted diesels.  However, because of restrictions imposed by the War
Production Board, the EM-1s were delivered from Baldwin between 1944 and
1945.  They were all retired by 1960.
