<h2>Yellowstones!</h2>
Of all surviving steam locomotives, these three Yellowstones boast the
greatest pulling force capabilities (TE: 140,000lbs) -- even greater than
that of the <a href="../bigboy/bigboy.html">UP Big Boys</a> (TE:
135,375lbs).  The Duluth Missabe & Iron Range Yellowstones were built by
Baldwin Locomotive Works between 1941 and 1943.  They were used to pull ore
trains throughout the Duluth area.  For the most part, ore trains had to be
pulled downhill to the ore docks on Lake Superior in Duluth and Two
Harbors.  These trips did not require the enormous pulling force of the
Yellowstones (although I'm sure it did help).  Surprisingly, the limiting
factor (as far as what the iron range locomotives could pull) was the 2.2
percent grade from Duluth up to the yards in Proctor.  The ore cars had to
be returned empty to these yards for sorting.  It was the task of returning
ore cars up this hill where these Yellowstones worked their hardest.

Yellowstone #221 was displayed for many years near the ore docks in the
city of Two Harbors, MN.  By the late 1960s, the locomotive was showing
signs of severe decay.  In 1969, #221 was scrapped.

<p>
In the Two Harbors roundhouse (which still stands today) another
Yellowstone was waiting.  In 1969, this Yellowstone, #229 was brought
out to replace #221.  A small shed was built over 229 to help protect
her from the weather.

Another Yellowstone (#225) rests in Proctor, MN.  Proctor is a few
miles west of Duluth and the site of a large railroad yard.  225 has
all of the boiler jacketing removed giving it a "white" appearance.
This will probably extend its life on display as moisture will not be
trapped against the boiler.

Yellowstone #227 is on display inside the Lake Superior Transportation
Museum.  As a result, it is difficult to get a decent current photograph
of her.  This postcard was taken years ago when she was still outside.
Today, her driving wheels are supported slightly above the railheads.
An electric motor is used to spin her wheels slowly so that you can
see the motion of the massive valve gear.  Of the three surviving
Yellowstones, #227 is probably in the best shape.
<h2>Mainline Milwaukee Road Steam<img src="../lost/milw.gif" align="right"></h2>
Another mainline steam locomotive appears!  The Milwaukee Road 261 was
leased from the National Railroad Museum in Green Bay to North Star
Rail.  North Star Rail restored 261 to operating condition and is now
using it to pull excursion trains throughout the mid-west.

<p>
These are some "before and after" photos of 261.  The first photo was
taken when 261 was being restored in the GE Apparatus Survice Center in
north Minneapolis.  Notice that the cab and rear truck have been
removed.  The other two photos were taken at 261's current home at
Minneapolis Junction just north of downtown Minneapolis.  261 is under
steam a few days before an excursion out of Chicago.  In the "portrait"
photo the mars light and fold up coupler are clearly seen.  In the
"builders style" photo you will notice the vestibule cab.  261s only
surviving sister engine is the 265 located at the
<a href="../union/union.html">Illinois Railway Museum</a>.
<h2>Minnesota Transportation Museum</h2>
<a href="np328.jpg"><img src="np328-icon.gif"></a>
<p>
The <a href="/~wes/mtm/">Minnesota Transportation Museum</a> is headquartered in St. Paul, MN and
operates a tourist railroad called the <a href="../mtm/oscv.html">Osceola
& St. Croix Valley Railway</a> in Osceola, WI.  Motive power includes an
SW1200, an NW2, and this Northern Pacific class S-10 Ten Wheeler #328.
This picture was taken of 328 under steam in Stillwater, MN in 1991.
<h2>Lake Superior Transportation Museum</h2>
<a href="gn1.jpg"><img src="gn1-icon.gif"></a>
<p>
The "William Crooks" (a 4-4-0) was Minnesota's first steam engine.  It
was owned by railroad pioneer James J. Hill.  For many years this locomotive
was displayed at the Union Depot in downtown St. Paul.  It is now on display
at the Lake Superior Transportation Museum in Duluth, MN.
<p>
<a href="dnm14.jpg"><img src="dnm14-icon.gif"></a>
<p>
The Duluth & Northern Minnesota #14 was restored to operating condition
in the early 1990s.  It was used in the movie "Iron Will" which was filmed
in the "Arrowhead" region of Minnesota in 1993.  This locomotive is on
display at the Lake Superior Transportation Museum in Duluth, MN.

As of 1995, Georga Northern ten-wheeler 102 was undergoing a cosmetic
restoration.  102 used to be displayed at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union,
IL.
