     Locomotive Number 60,000 was tested on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad 
during the months of November and December, 1926.  These tests were conducted 
on the East End of the Cumberland Division, between Brunswick and Keyser, 
Maryland, a distance of 109 miles; on the Connellsville Division, between 
Cumberland, Maryland, and Connellsville, Pennsylvania, a distance of 90.5 
miles; and on the Pittsburgh Division between Connellsville and New Castle 
junction, Pennsylvania, a distance of 109.4 miles. <p>

     Seven round trips were made on the Cumberland Division, nine on the 
Connellsville Division and two on the Pittsburgh Division, the total mileage 
covered being 2770.  The locomotive was in excellent condition, as it had been 
thoroughly overhauled at the plant of the builders before being delivered to 
the Railroad Company. <p>

     Baltimore & Ohio dynamometer car number 930 was used between the tender 
and train on all the tests.  The locomotive was fitted with steam indicators 
and reducing motion to all cylinders, and indicator cards covering every 
condition of speed and reverse lever position were taken.  Temperature and 
pressure of the steam in the steam chest, temperature of the exhaust steam, 
smokebox gases, water to and from the heater, receiver pipe pressure, and 
draft ahead of and behind the diaphragm on the horizontal center line of the 
smokebox were recorded.<p>
                                                               
     The coal used was measured in a box, having a capacity of 920 pounds of 
run of mine gas coal.  The water space in the tender had been previously 
calibrated, and the quantity of water used was determined by means of a float. <p>
                                                               
     On each division, the same engine crew handled the locomotive on all 
runs, and the trips were made by daylight.<p>
                                                               
     Cumberland Division, East End-Between Keyser and Brunswick the general 
trend is descending eastbound and this is also the direction of the loaded 
movement.  The maximum ascending grade is 0.73 per cent, between Opequon and 
Hobbs, a distance of 7.3 miles.   Westbound the steepest ascending grade which 
reaches a maximum of 0.87 per cent, is between Brunswick and Hobbs, a
distance of 15.2 miles.  There are frequent curves of between five and six 
degrees, the maximum curvature being approximately ten degrees.  <p>

       There was an opportunity on this division, to compare the performance 
of Locomotive Number 60,000 with that of the Baltimore & Ohio's standard 2-10-
2 type, designated by the Railroad Company as Class S-1.  This locomotive uses 
superheated steam at a pressure of 220 pounds, and develops a tractive force 
of 82,730 pounds.  On a drawbar horsepower hour basis, Number 60,000 showed an 
economy in coal consumption of 16 to 18 per cent, and in water of 20 to 22 per 
cent, while the evaporation was almost nine per cent greater than in Class S-
1. <p>
                                                            
      Connellsville Division.-This is a mountain division, with a summit at 
Sand Patch, 33.4 miles west of Cumberland and approximately 59 miles east of 
Connellsville.  Westbound out of Cumberland, the maximum  ascending grade to 
Sand Patch is 1.52 per cent.  The line then descends to Connellsville, the 
maximum grade being one per cent.  Helpers are used in both directions with 
full tonnage trains.<p>

     Pittsburgh   Division.--Westbound   from   Connellsville, on this 
division, the grades are light and generally  descending to Laughlin  
junction,  a  distance  of  about  52  miles.  Between  Laughlin  junction  
and  New  Castle  junction,   the profile  is  undulating.  Westbound,  there  
is  a  grade   of 1.31 per cent, IY2 miles long, and a grade of 1.05  per  
cent, 6Y2 miles long.  Eastbound  there  is  a  grade  of  0.68  per cent, 
eight miles long, and a grade  of  0.90  per  cent,  one mile  in  length.  
The  sharpest  curvature  on  this  run  is 14 degrees 25 minutes.<p>

     The following table gives the results of the tests on these three 
divisions of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad.  The data for the Connellsville 
Division covers the runs on ascending grades only, or from Connellsville to

<h2>THE BALDWIN LOCOMOTIVE WORKS</h2>
<h2>Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad</h2>                            

     Locomotive Number 60,000 was tested on the Beardstown Division of the 
Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad during the month of February, 1927.  The 
Beardstown Division taps the bituminous coal fields of Illinois, and is a 
comparatively level line, the  maximumgrade against loaded traffic being 0.3 
per cent.<p>

     The tests were run to compare the performance of Locomotive 60,000 with 
that of the Burlington's standard Class M-2-A locomotives of the 2-10-2 type.  
Engine 6157, which was in as good mechanical condition as Number 60,000, was 
selected for this purpose.  Both locomotives were handled, on all the tests, 
by the same engine crew.  The dynamometer car was used to record the speed, 
drawbar pull, and horse-power, and the coal was measured in a box holding 850 
pounds.<p>

     While the starting tractive forces of these two locomotives were nearly 
the same, engine 60,000 showed a considerably greater horse-power capacity 
with increasing speed.  Thus, at 15 miles an hour it developed 19 per cent 
more drawbar pull than engine 6157, while at 30 miles an hour, the increase 
was 58 per cent.  The average amounts of coal and water used per drawbar 
horse-power, on all the tests, were as follows:<p>

     Between Beardstown and Galesburg, where the locomotives were worked at 
maximum capacity with loaded trains, engine 6157 hauled 6800 tons and engine 
60,000, 7,300 tons.  On a 100 ton-mile basis engine 60,000 saved 24.8 per cent 
in  coal and 24.2 in water, as compared with engine 6157.  The same tonnages 
were handled by the locomotives from Centralia to Beardstown, and here
the savings effected by engine 60,000 as compared with engine 6157, in coal 
and water consumed per 100 ton-miles, were respectively 16.2 and 24.4 per 
cent.<p>

<h2>Locomotive 60,000 Under Test on the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway</h2>

<h2>Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway   </h2>                   

     Locomotive Number 60,000 was received by the Santa Fe System at Fort 
Madison, Iowa, on February 24, 1927.  It was there fitted with test equipment, 
and then hauled a tonnage train to Clovis, New Mexico.  This preliminary run 
was of value because of the experience gained in handling the locomotive.<p>

     The tests were conducted on the First and Second Districts of the Pecos 
Division between Clovis and Belen, New Mexico.  Between Clovis and 
Mountainair, a distance of approximately 200 miles, the ruling grade in each 
direction is 0.6 per cent.  Westbound, however, conditions are far more severe 
than when going east, on account of the length of the grades.  Between 
Mountainair and Belen, a distance of 40.5 miles, there is a steady descent, 
the ruling grade against eastbound trains being 1.25 per cent for the greater 
part of the distance. This is normally a pusher grade, but on the majority of 
the runs with Locomotive Number 60,000, the tonnage was adjusted to suit the 
capacity of the engine.<p>

       The Santa Fe dynamometer car was used on these tests, and the
locomotive was fitted with a three-inch water meter on the right side, a four-
inch water meter on the left (pump) side, a feed-water thermometer, smoke-box 
and steam chest pyrometers, and gauges for steam chest, receiver, and back
pressure.  A front end cinder catcher was also applied.  The tender coal space 
was calibrated, and a check of the coal used was made from scales attached to 
the coal chutes.<p>

       Pool turn engineers and firemen were used on these runs, and also a 
regularly assigned fireman; while the Fuel Supervisor of the Pecos Division 
was on the tests, to assure uniform handling of the locomotive.  Crews were 
changed at Vaughan in each direction. <p>

       The heaviest work on these tests was done between Belen and 
Mountainair, eastbound.  The following table gives the results obtained on 
three trips, as compared with two trips made with locomotives of the 3800 
class (2-10-2 type) used by the Santa Fe System:<p>

      Considering all the tests made between Clovis and Test Belen, in both 
directions, Locomotive 60,000 showed the Results following results as compared 
with locomotives of the 3800 class:<p>

Tractive force               75,700 lb. </pre>   

       The thermal efficiency at the drawbar, or the relation of useful work 
to energy in the fuel, was 27 per cent greater. <p>

       The total water per 1000 ton-miles was 21.6 per cent less, and the 
water from the tender was 27.0 per cent less.<p>

The coal per 1000 ton-miles was 24.5 per cent less. <p>  
       As a general conclusion, Locomotive 60,000 saved from 20 to 25 per cent 
fuel and water as compared with locomotives of the 3800 class, operating 
single expansion with 195, pounds boiler pressure and without feed-water 
heaters.<p>
            <h2>Southern Pacific Company</h2>                             

     During the late summer and fall of 1927, Locomotive Number 60,000 was 
tested on the Pacific lines of the Southern Pacific Company.  When received on  
the road, it had made about 75,000 miles and was in good condition.  At the 
Sacramento Shops of the Southern Pacific Company the locomotive was changed 
from a coal to an oil burner, and was given a thorough inspection.  Driving 
tires were turned, and new piston and valve stem packing applied where needed.<p>

     The Southern Pacific tests were run on the Sacramento Division, in both 
passenger and freight service.  Dynamometer Car number 137 was used on all 
runs, and the locomotive was indicated and very complete records were taken.  
A standard Southern Pacific twelve-wheeled tender was used with water and oil 
tanks calibrated.<p>

     These tests were run between Roseville, California, and Sparks, Nevada, a 
distance of 139.2 miles.  This is a mountain section, with difficult operating 
conditions.  It is double tracked and rock ballasted, and laid with rails 
weighing  110  and  130  pounds  per  yard.  Eastbound, from Roseville  to  
Colfax,  a  distance  of  35.9  miles,  the steepest  ascending  grade  is  
1.5  per  cent,  with   maximum curves (compensated) of four degrees.  From 
Colfax to Emigrant Gap, a distance of 30 miles, the maximum grade is 2.665 per 
cent, one mile in length, with curves compensated.  For the greater part of 
the remainder the maximum grade averages 2.2 per cent, with curves 
uncompensated.  From Emigrant Gap to Summit, 21 miles, the grade for the 
greater part of the distance is about 1.8 per cent.  The sharpest curves are 
approximately ten degrees.  From Summit to Sparks, 53.2 miles, the grade is 
descending.<p>

     Westbound, from Sparks to Truckee, a distance of 38 miles, the maximum 
grade is one per cent, except for a few short stretches where it is a little 
heavier.  The sharpest curves are  ten degrees  compensated.  From Truckee to 
Summit, a distance of 15.6 miles on the westbound track, the maximum grade is 
two per cent with curves of ten degrees.  The line descends the entire 
distance from Summit to Roseville.<p>

Locomotive 60,000 as Equipped for Oil Burning on the Southern Pacific Lines<p>

     In the tests with freight trains, the tonnage was adjusted so that it 
could be handled without helpers.  The passenger trains were handled in the 
same way. <p>

     California crude oil was used for fuel on these tests, and was fired with 
a Von Bodeningles burner, located back of the arch tubes in the center of the 
firebox, with the tip pointing toward the firedoor.  Considerable 
experimenting was necessary before the engine would steam well when burning 
oil. <p>

     The general results of the tests are given in the following table.  The 
data covers the performance on ascending grades only. <p>

                 <h2> Great  Northern Railway</h2> 

       Coming east, Locomotive Number 60,000 hauled tonnage trains from Delta, 
near Everett, Washington, to Minot, North Dakota, a distance of about 1265 
miles.  The run was made in January, 1928.<p>

       Oil was used for fuel on this run.  Owing to the construction of the 
firebox, it was necessary, as on the Southern Pacific, to place the burner 
above the bottom boiler tubes.  This probably did not permit the most complete 
combustion, but at no time did the engine lag for steam.<p>

        The locomotive, as a rule, held the rail well, and little difficulty 
was experienced in starting heavy trains.  Helpers were used at five points 
where grade conditions were difficult.<p>

        The following table gives a log of the trip, with data covering fuel 
and water consumed: <p>

     Subsequent to the run described on page 79, engine 60,000 was changed to 
burn coal, and was tested on two round trips between Minneapolis and Superior.  
On this divisior the prevailing loaded movement is southbound out of Superior, 
and the most difficult stretch is from Boylston to Nickerson, a distance of 
23.5 miles, on which there is an ascending grade averaging 21.12 feet per 
mile.  The locomotive made an excellent showing on this division, the general 
results being given in the following table:<p>

      We feel that these road tests fully bear out the exceedingly encouraging 
results obtained on the Pennsylvania's stationary plant at Altoona.  At no 
time, while under test, did the locomotive require major repairs; and the 
comments made on its performance, by the officials of the roads on which it 
was used, were generally highly favorable.  Furthermore, it was worked under 
quite as great a variety of conditions as a locomotive of its type and 
capacity would be called upon to meet in regular service.  An analysis of the 
results obtained, as presented in this publication, will, we feel confident, 
demonstrate the soundness of the principles underlying the design of 
Locomotive 60,000.<p>
