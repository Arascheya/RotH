<h1>Discussion of</h1>
<h1>Tests of Locomotive 60,000</h1>
<h3>By LAWFORD H. FRY.</h3>
</center>
     25.  After a few preliminary runs on the road, Locomotive 60,000 was 
turned over to the Pennsylvania Railroad to be tested on the locomotive 
testing plant at Altoona. <p>

     26.  Through the courtesy of the Pennsylvania Railroad we are permitted 
to publish on page 27 et seq., some extracts from the official report giving 
the results of the tests of Locomotive 60,000 on the locomotive test plant.<br>

     These extracts deal with all the more important phases of the operation 
of the locomotive and give also the complete data of the observations made so 
that a more detailed study may be made by those interested.<br>
             
     The report as quoted presents the observed facts without comment.  It is, 
therefore, supplemented by the present discussion which endeavors to give a 
certain perspective to the figures, and to establish their relation to similar 
figures from locomotives of more conventional design. <p>

     27. The locomotive test plant is too well known to require detailed 
description.  On it a locomotive under test is supported as shown in <A HREF="fig15.jpg"><b>Figure 15</b></a> 
on carrying wheels which are controlled by hydraulic friction brakes so that 
the power developed can be absorbed, while the tractive effort is measured by 
a dynamometer.<br>

     On the test plant it is possible to run a locomotive continuously for  an 
hour or more with perfect uniformity of speed and cut-off.  At the same time 
water and coal measurements, and observations of draft and temperature, can be 
made with an accuracy unattainable in road tests. <p>

     While all test measurements can be made with much more facility and 
accuracy on the test plant, this is particularly true of indicator diagrams.  
In the case of road tests, corrections are necessary for acceleration due to 
grades or change of speed, and it is always possible, by a change in throttle 
or reverse lever, to produce a card which does not in any way correspond to 
the speed at which the engine is running.  On the test plant such 
irregularities cannot occur, and the indicator cards are far more reliable 
than those obtained in road service.<p>         

    28.  The tests made by the Pennsylvania Railroad on Locomotive 60,000 
covered speeds from 80 to 200 revolutions per minute (15 to 37.5 miles per 
hour), and cut-offs from 50 to 90 per cent in the high-pressure, and 20 to 70 
per cent in the low-pressure cylinders.  The indicated horse-power developed 
ranged from 1500 to 4500, at which figure the capacity of the test plant was 
reached, otherwise a higher power could have been developed.<p>

    29.  Maximum power was developed at 200 revolutions per minute with a cut-
off of 80 per cent in the high and 50 per cent in the low-pressure cylinders.  
With these conditions held constant during a test run of one hour's duration, 
the following results were obtained: <p>         


<pre>     Indicated     horse-power.....................        4515
     Equivalent evaporation, pounds per hour....         83,769
     Coal fired, total dry coal, pounds per hour...      11,827
      "   "  dry  coal per square foot of grate,
             pounds per hour......................          143
     Boiler efficiency, per cent..................           51
     Steam  per  indicated  horse-power hour, pounds       14.9  
     Dry coal per    "        "     "     "     "           2.7
     Draw  bar  pull, pounds.....................        35,000 </pre>

     During this test the boiler pressure averaged 344 pounds per square inch, 
with a temperature of 683 degrees F. or 257 degrees superheat in the branch 
pipe.  The horse-power and equivalent evaporation of this test are both higher 
than have been reached with any other locomotive on the test plant.  They 
represent approximately the maximum values likely to be reached by Locomotive 
60,000 in regular operation, although as stated elsewhere, they could have 
been exceeded if the capacity of the test plant had not been reached.<br>

     On a repeat test with the same cut-off and speed a similar horse-power 
was obtained with the same coal rate and a water rate of 15.4 pounds.  This 
gives an average water rate of 15.15 pounds per indicated horsepower hour for 
a working rate of 4500 horse-power indicated. <p>

                 <h2>Boiler Performance</h2>                                

     30.  The evaporative capacity of the boiler is dealt with in section 45.  
The evaporative capacity of the boiler was high, and so far as published 
records show,is higher than that of any other locomotive boiler tested at 
Altoona.  This is due to the large dimensions of heating surface, grate area 
and combustion space. <p>

     31.  Particulars of the boiler efficiency are given in section 47. When 
plotted against the rate of firing per square foot of grate per hour as in 
<A HREF="fig21.gif"><b>Fig. 21</b></a>, the boiler efficiency is well represented by a straight line ranging 
from about 67 per cent at 40 pounds of dry coal per square foot of grate per 
hour to about 53 per cent at 140 pounds of dry coal per square foot of grate 
per hour.<p>

    More detailed information on the boiler efficiency is given by the heat 
balances plotted in <A HREF="fig22.gif"><b>Fig. 22</b></a>, and by the determination of the efficiencies of 
heat production and heat absorption.  As shown in <A HREF="fig23.gif"><b>Fig. 23</b></a> the efficiency of 
heat absorption is about 82 per cent at all rates of working, while the 
efficiency of combustion falls off as the rate of firing increases.  <p>

     Comparison of these efficiencies with those obtained from modern boilers 
with fireboxes of the conventional type shows little difference in the overall 
boiler efficiency.  The tests show that the water-tube firebox has little 
effect on steam production.  Its purpose is to eliminate the necessity for 
flat stayed surfaces in a high-pressure boiler. <p>

     32.  Examination of the figures of Item 24  on  page 52 shows that the 
temperature of the steam in the branch pipe ranged from 568 degrees F. at the 
lowest power to 683 degrees at high power.  These figures compare closely with 
those usually obtained with other locomotives.  The superheat corresponding to 
the foregoing figures varies from 135 to 257 degrees, item 34a, page 54.<p>

<h2>Engine Performance</h2> 

     33.  Section 50 shows that for all cut-offs between 50/20 (that is 50 per 
cent in the high and 20 per cent in the low-pressure cylinders) and 8O/5O and 
at all speeds from 15 to 30 miles per hour, 80 to 160 revolutions per minute, 
the water rate lies between 14.2 and 15.2 pounds per indicated horse-power 
hour.  Even at full gear with a cut-off 90/70, the water rate is only 16.3 
pounds at 15 miles per hour, and 16.6 pounds at 22.5 miles per hour. <p>

     Examination of the information available from published records shows 
that the best water rate on record for an American locomotive ranges from 15.5 
to 19 pounds, these figures being obtained with 250 pounds per square inch 
boiler pressure. The usual modern locomotive with a boiler pressure of 200 
pounds per square inch and possible full stroke cut-off will usually be found 
to have a water rate ranging from 17 to 27 pounds per indicated horse-power 
hour.<p>

     It is evident that in Locomotive 60,000 the combination of high pressure 
and high expansion gives a high degree of engine efficiency. <p>

     34.  The ratio of expansion computed by Heck's method is shown in <A HREF="fig42.gif"><b>Fig. 42</b></a>, see section 52.     <p>                 

    35.  Section 53 reports on the pressures at release and at the end of 
expansion.  Owing to the high ratio of expansion obtained in the compound 
cylinders of Locomotive 60,000, the pressures at the end of expansion are less 
than would usually be obtained in single expansion cylinders using steam of 
lower initial pressure.  This is a factor in increasing the cylinder 
efficiency.  At the end of expansion the steam is exhausted and loses pressure 
without doing useful work.  This represents a loss which can be reduced by a 
high ratio of expansion which produces low pressures at the end of expansion. <p>

     36.  The proportion of power developed respectively by the high and by 
the low-pressure cylinders is discussed in section 54.  It varies with the 
speed and cut-off.  At 200 revolutions per minute and a cut-off of 80/50 when 
developing 4500 horse-power as above, the  high-pressure cylinder delivers 
1080 horse-power or 24 per cent of the total, leaving an average of 38 per 
cent for each of the low-pressure cylinders.  That is, at this speed .and cut-
off, the high-pressure cylinder does about one-third less worth than each of 
the low-pressure cylinders. If the speed of 200 revolutions per minute be 
maintained and the cut-off shortened to 60/30 the indicated  horse-power drops 
to 2880, of which only 145 horse-power or 5 per cent is contributed by the 
high-pressure cylinder.  This combination of cut-off and speed does not 
represent conditions likely to be met in actual service, as the power 
developed is only slightly over one-half that of which the engine is capable.<p>                                           

     The  cylinders  were designed to give equal work up to approximately 22 
miles per hour, after which, as the tests verify, the inside engine is 
relieved with increasing speed. <p>

     37. These tests, which are reported in section 60,are interesting
in showing that a drawbar pull less than the maximum capacity of
Locomotive 60,000, can in many cases be obtained more economically by
throttling than by shortening the cut-off.  This is contrary to the
generally accepted practice with ordinary single expansion locomotives,
but for Locomotive 60,000 is borne out by experience in road tests.  
In actual service it is usually better to use the throttle rather than
the reverse lever for minor reductions in tractive effort.<p>
