<h1>Design and Construction of</h1>
<h1>Locomotive 60,000</h1>
<h3>By PAUL T. WARNER.</h3>
</center>
   1.  The locomotive forming the subject of this bulletin is the 60,000th 
locomotive built by The Baldwin Locomotive Works.  It was built during the 
early part of the year 1926 as an experiment to ascertain the possible 
economies which can be effected by the use of high steam pressures and a high 
ratio of expansion.<p>

    2. Up to a certain period, development of loco-motive design brought with 
it mainly an increase in weight of individual locomotives, the increase in 
power being proportionate to the increase in weight.  This increase in power 
made possible notable economies in railroading.  Of late years, however, the 
demand for still further economies has led locomotive designers to strive to 
increase the efficiency of the locomotive, and thus give increased power per 
unit of locomotive weight. Among the means adopted successfully to this end, 
are the use of superheated steam, various fuel and labor-saving devices, 
improved boiler design, more efficient steam distribution, and refinements in 
design and materials for locomotive parts.<p>

          3.  At present much thought is being given to the possibility of 
using higher ratios of expansion to give greater cylinder efficiency and 
consequently greater horse-power per unit of weight.<p>

    4. The great advantage of high pressure steam is that a combination of 
adequate cylinder force and high ratio of expansion can be obtained with 
cylinders of moderate dimensions.<p>

     5. In view of the limits set to steam temperatures by the method of 
producing the steam and by difficulties of lubrication, locomotive designers 
must, at least for the present, aim at a steam temperature of approximately 
650 degrees F., with a maximum of say 700 degrees, irrespective of the 
pressure used. Now, if the pressure is increased while the temperature remains 
constant, the superheat and the heat content per pound of steam fall off as 
the pressure is increased.  For example, a steam temperature of 650 degrees F. 
gives, at 200 pounds,per square inch, about 263 degrees superheat and 1340 
B.T.U. per pound of steam, and at 350 pounds per square inch about 217 degrees 
superheat and 1332 B.T.U.<br>
If steam of 200 pounds per square inch and of 350 pounds per square inch is 
expanded from the same temperature under such conditions in each case respec-
tively that the exhaust steam escapes at the same pressure and temperature, 
and with the same heat content in both cases, it follows that the heat taken 
from the steam in the cylinders and converted into mechanical work will be 
slightly less with the high than with the low pressure steam.  That is, with 
the same heat content in the exhaust steam, the higher pressure will not give 
greater thermal efficiency. To reduce the heat content of the exhaust steam 
and thus increase the thermal efficiency, it is necessary to increase the 
ratio of expansion.<p>

  6. An increase in the ratio of expansion results in a reduction in the mean 
effective pressure obtained from a given boiler pressure, and this requires an 
increase in cylin-der dimensions if the same power is to be developed.  Now in 
a large modern locomotive of conventional design, an increase in cylinder 
dimensions to permit of higher expansion would lead to difficulties in design, 
and it is advantageous to use a higher boiler pressure so that the increase in 
expansion can be obtained without involving a loss in power or an abnormal 
increase in cylinder dimensions.<p>

     7.  As a means of obtaining the higher expansion necessary to give 
economy with steam of 350 pounds per square inch, Locomotive 60,000 was 
designed with three cylinders compounded, the high-pressure steam being first 
admitted to the middle cylinder. After expansion there, the steam passes 
through the receiver in the cylinder saddle to the two outside cylinders where 
further expansion takes place.<p>

    8. Steam pressures of 200 to 215 pounds per square inch have been 
currently used for a number of years, and in the last two or three years a 
considerable number of locomotives have been built for working steam pres-
sures of 240 and 250 pounds per square inch.  This latter is probably about 
the maximum pressure which can be carried successfully in boilers of the 
conventional design with fireboxes having flat sides braced by staybolts. The 
stayed firebox is the weakest point in a locomotive as ordinarily designed, 
and with pressures carried above 250 pounds per square inch a change in design 
is necessary to eliminate excessive trouble with staybolt breakage. The 
decision to use a pressure of 350 pounds per square inch in Locomotive 60,000 
led to the adoption of a water tube firebox, and the elimination of all 
staybolts.<p>

<h2> General Description of Locomotive 60,000</h2>

  9.  The locomotive is of the 4-10-2 type, built for freight service, with 
driving wheels 63.5 inches in diameter, and three cylinders each 27 inches in 
diameter by 32 inches stroke.  The total weight in working order is 457,500 
pounds, of which 338,400 are on driving wheels. Full detailed dimensions are 
given on page 6.<p>

  10. Apart from the modifications necessary to the use of the water-tube 
firebox and the high pressure, the boiler does not differ in principle from 
that of the con-ventional locomotive.  The boiler barrel is of the usual 
firetube type having 206 2.25-inch tubes and a type A superheater carried in 
50 5.5-inch flues.<p>

  11. The barrel consists of three courses, having plates respectively 1 5\16, 
1 3\8 and 1.5 inches thick. The third course is sloped on top, increasing the 
shell diameter from 84 inches at the front end to 94 inches at the back. All 
circumferential seams are double riveted, and the longitudinal seams are of 
the so-called "saw-tooth" octuple riveted design, which provides a short 
caulking distance between the rivets.  At the rear,the barrel is closed by a 
tube sheet, which is riveted to the shell in the same manner as the front tube 
sheet.  The boiler tubes and flues are welded into the rear tube sheet. None of the studs tapped into the boiler passes all the way through the 
sheets, hence there can be no leaky studs or stays.<p>

<A HREF="fig2.jpg"> <b>Locomotive Partially Erected:</a></b><br> <i>Showing Completed Boiler One of the two 
elbow pipes which deliver water from the boiler barrel to the mud-ring, is 
plainly shown.</i><p>

    12.  The firebox is of the water-tube type, each side wall consisting of 
48 tubes 4 inches in diameter connecting a hollow cast steel mud-ring at the 
bottom to one of the horizontal cylindrical drums at the top. Outside of these 
side tubes a firebrick shell is built, over which are applied removable cover 
plates which are covered with magnesia sectional lagging and jacketed. The 
front and back walls of the firebox are of firebrick, and the opening between 
the two drums forming the crown of the firebox is also closed with firebrick.<p>
<A HREF="fig3.jpg"> <b>Boiler: </a></b><br>  <i> This view shows the openings in the rear firebox wall for 
the fire-door and stoker, also the relative positions of the upper drums, 
water tubes and mud-ring. No stay bolts are used in the construction of the 
firebox.</i><p>
   This construction provides a boiler entirely free from staybolts and from 
flat surfaces requiring staybolts. This feature of the design gives it an important advantage when high steam 
pressures are to be carried.
     The depth of the firebox from the top of the mud-ring to the center line 
of the drums is 6 feet 6 inches. The total volume, including combustion 
chamber, reaches the large figure of 683 cubic feet.  This gives 8.3 cubic 
feet of volume for each of the 82.5 square feet of grate area, which is a high 
relative volume for a modern locomotive, and aids in securing effective and 
efficient combustion.<p>

<A HREF="fig4.jpg"> <b> Firebox with Firebrick Applied.</a></b><p>

    13. The two drums are each 26 inches in diameter, and the transverse 
distance between their centers is 31 inches.  They have a total length of 23 
feet 6 inches, and extend into the boiler barrel a distance of 5 feet 6 inches 
ahead of the back tube sheet.  The openings in this sheet, through which the 
drums pass, have flanges 6 5\8 inches in depth, to which the drums are double 
riveted Each drum is closed, at the rear, by a cover plate which is secured to 
an internal ring by means of studs, and is fitted with a copper gasket to keep 
the joint tight. By removing these covers the drums can be entered for 
purposes of inspection, and the water tubes can be "turbined" during washing-
out, to remove any scale.<p>

<A HREF="fig5.jpg"> <b> Cast Steel Mud-ring:</a></b><br>
<i>This view shows the under side of the mud-ring, the front being toward the 
left.  The holes for the elbow pipes to connect to the boiler barrel, and for 
the plugs under the tubes, through which the tubes are rolled, are plainly 
shown; also the lugs for the supporting plates.  The transverse member carries 
the firebrick arch and divides the grate from the combustion chamber.</i>      <p>     

<A HREF="fig6.jpg"> <b>Firebox Partially Assembled:</a></b><br>
<i>This view shows the firebox wall and arch, with the supporting tubes.  The 
water tubes on the left side of the firebox are not yet in place.  The grate 
is back of the arch, while the space ahead serves as a combustion chamber.</i><p>

This can be done without removing any of the lower plugs, one of which is 
placed in the mud-ring opposite each tube end for rolling the tubes.<br>

  Evidence obtained in road tests with different kinds of water shows very 
light accumulation of scale in the drums and water-tubes.  This indicates that 
less frequent turbining and cleaning are necessary than with the con-ventional 
type of stayed firebox.<br>

    The third course in the boiler barrel is sloped on top, and the two upper 
drums are so located that their forward extensions come in contact with this 
course and are riveted to it. This acts as a support for the drums, and tends 
to counteract the cantilever effect of the long overhanging firebox.  
Furthermore, to balance the effect of the pressure on the covers at the back 
ends of the drums, three longitudinal stay rods are run from the forward end 
of each drum to the front tube sheet. These rods are anchored to internal 
braces which are riveted to the drum.  This construction, together with a 
system of braces connecting the front end of the mud-ring and the boiler 
barrel, relieves the back tube sheet of any tendency to distortion, due to the 
firebox overhang and the pressure on the drum heads.<p>

   14. The hollow cast steel mud-ring is connected to each upper drum by 48 
tubes each 4 inches in diameter; and there are also four tubes connecting the 
drums to the back section of the mud-ring.  All these tubes are swedged to a 
diameter of 3 inches at the mud-ring end, where they are rolled and belled, 
while at the drum end they are rolled, belled and welded. The tube holes in 
the mud-ring have two depressions rolled into them, into which the tubes lock 
themselves firmly when being rolled in. Water connection between the bottom of 
the boiler barrel and the front end of the mud-ring is made by two elbow 
pipes, each 9 inches in diameter, and placed right and left.<p>

     15. The mud-ring, which has a total length of 18 feet 2 inches and a 
width of 8 feet 5 inches, is cored throughout to permit water circulation. The 
rectangular outer frame is crossed by a central longitudinal member and also 
by a transverse member located about six feet back of the front end of the 
firebox.  From this transverse member, which lies at the front end of the 
grate, five water tubes extend to the upper drums, and serve as supports for 
the brick arch.  That portion of the firebox which is forward of the arch 
constitutes a combustion chamber and is closed, at the bottom, by a horizontal 
steel plate, and floored with firebrick.  A Y-shaped cinder pocket is applied 
for cleaning this combustion chamber.<p>

     16.  The locomotive is at present arranged for burning stoke, coal, and 
is equipped with a Duplex stoker.  It has, how-ever, also been operated as an 
oil burner.<p>                            



<A HREF="fig7.jpg"> <b>Cylinders:</a></b><br>

<i>This is a rear view of the one-piece cylinder casting completely finished and 
drilled, with the truck center-pin in place.</i><p>

<A HREF="fig8.jpg"> <b>Guides and Crossheads:</a></b><br>

<i>This view shows the light design of crosshead used, also the method of 
supporting the outside guides on bearers at each end.</i><p>

<A HREF="fig9.jpg"> <b>Inside (High-pressure) Main Rod::</a></b><br>

<i>The back end of this rod is of the marine type, with a floating bushing. The 
brass is held in place by a U-shaped strap, which is forged in one piece with 
the bolts.</i><p>

       17. The dome is placed on the second barrel course, and is connected 
with the superheater header by an in-ternal dry-pipe. A smokebox throttle of 
the multiple type is applied, and there is a shut-off valve for the steam 
supply in the dome.<p>

     18.  The three cylinders, with their steam passages and steam chests, are 
formed in a single grey iron casting. The high-pressure steam chest is placed 
in the saddle, on the right-hand side, and is connected with the super-heater 
by a single steam pipe. All the piston valves are 14 inches in diameter, that 
for the high-pressure cylinder being arranged for inside admission, while the 
valves for the low-pressure (outside) cylinders are arranged for outside 
admission. The  high-pressure exhaust is conveyed to the low-pressure steam 
chests through passages cored in the cylinder casting; while the exhaust from 
the low-pressure cylinders passes to the smokebox through outside pipes which 
terminate in a single exhaust nozzle. A Worthington feed-water heater is 
applied to this locomotive, and a branch from each exhaust pipe conveys the 
steam to the heater.<p>

      19. For starting purposes, live steam is admitted to the low-pressure 
cylinders through a 1.5-inch pipe leading from a manually-controlled valve in 
the cab. This creates a back pressure on the high-pressure piston,- relieving the same from the full 
effect of 350 pounds' pressure.<p>

<A HREF="fig10.jpg"> <b>Crank Axle and Wheels Assembled:</a></b><br>
  <i>This is the second pair of driving wheels, the outside cylinders being 
connected to the third pair. The axle is built up of five pieces.</i><p>
<A HREF="fig11.jpg"> <b>End View of the Completed Crank Axle:</a></b><br>
 <i> The crank cheeks are of cast steel, each made in one piece with a counter-
balance weight which is cored hollow and filled with lead.</i><p>                                        

    20.  The two outside cranks are placed 90 degrees apart, so that there are 
four even exhausts per revolution, and the inside crank is placed at 135 
degrees from each outside crank.  The high-pressure piston is connected to the 
second pair of driving wheels, and the two low-pressure pistons to the third 
pair. All three piston heads are of the built-up type, with spiders of open 
hearth cast steel. The main and side rods are of carbon vanadium steel, while 
the driving axles, main crank pins and piston rods are of open hearth steel, 
heat treated, oil quenched and hollow bored. The  cross-heads are of the 
underhung multiple bearing type, as developed by Mr. J. T. Wallis, now 
Assistant Vice President in Charge of Operation of the Pennsylvania Railroad, 
and adopted as standard for heavy power by that road.  They work in guides 
having two inwardly projecting horizontal ribs on each side.<p>

<A HREF="fig12.jpg"><b>Cast Steel Valve Motion Bar:</a></b><br>
    <i> The three links, the reverse shaft, the outside guides, the brake 
cylinders, and a waist sheet, are supported by this casting.</i><p>

     21. Walschaerts valve gear is used, with an inde-pendent motion for each 
cylinder, but all controlled by one type B Ragonnet power reverse gear.  The 
valve for the left-hand cylinder is operated from the left-hand main pin and 
crosshead in the usual way. The right-hand valve receives its lead from the 
right-hand cross-head, but the link for this cylinder is operated through a 
transverse shaft, by means of a connection to the left-hand 
crosshead. The return crank on the right-hand main pin is set to operate the 
valve for the inside cylinder, and this valve is given lead through a 
connection with the inside crosshead. The arrangement of the links, arms and 
rockers through which these connections are made, is shown in the accompanying 
drawings. The valve motion bearer is a single steel casting supporting 
practically the entire valve gear.<p>

 22. This locomotive, designed to traverse curves curving of 17 degrees, has 
flanged tires on all the wheels. Lateral motion boxes are applied to the first 
driving axle. The front truck has a swing bolster suspended on heart-shaped 
links, while the rear truck is of the Delta type, and is so designed that a 
booster can subsequently be applied if necessary. There is a continuous 
equalization system on each side of the locomotive, from the leading drivers 
to the rear truck.<p>

  23. The accessories are all operated by superheated steam at a pressure of 
350 pounds, except the feed-water heater and injector, which use saturated 
steam at the same pressure.<p>

  24.  The tender is carried on two six-wheeled trucks, and is of the 
Vanderbilt type with capacity for 12,000 gallons of water and 16 tons of coal.<p>
