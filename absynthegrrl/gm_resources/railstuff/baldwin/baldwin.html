<h3>AN EXPERIMENTAL LOCOMOTIVE</h3>

<i>THIS PUBLICATION CONTAINS, ON PAGES 2 TO 59, A REPRINT OF A BOOKLET ISSUED IN 
1927, GIVING A DESCRIPTION OF THE LOCOMOTIVE AND RESULTS OF TESTS MADE ON THE 
PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD STATIONARY PLANT AT ALTOONA. THESE TESTS WERE CONDUCTED 
DURING THE MONTHS OF AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, 1926. DURING THE PERIOD OCTOBER, 
1926, TO FEBRUARY, 1928, THE LOCOMOTIVE WAS OPERATED IN ROAD TESTS ON THE 
PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD, THE BALTIMORE & OHIO RAILROAD, THE ERIE RAILROAD, THE 
CHICAGO, BURLINGTON & QUINCY RAILROAD, THE ATCHISON, TOPEKA & SANTA FE 
RAILWAY, THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC LINES, AND THE GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY. THE 
GENERAL RESULTS OF THESE TESTS, AS FAR AS THEY HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE BY THE 
RAILROAD COMPANIES MENTIONED, ARE PRESENTED ON PAGES 60 TO 80 OF THE PRESENT 
PUBLICATION.</i>

<b>Editors Note: </b>This project was undertaken by Paul Pullen. Please read the <A HREF="who_why.html"><b>Who & Why</b></a> section to understand how this document came to be. I thought this information would be must reading for any steam historians and fans, but realized that the many images and charts were need to really be complete. I offered Paul a place to house this work for all to see and study. The bulk of the work was done by Paul. I did the HTML work and converted his images for the Web. <br> Because of the length of this document, it has been broken down into sections as listed below. Each section has it own images and charts as originally published. To help keep file sizes small, the images are JPG's whereas the charts, being 1 bit graphic files, are in the GIF format. This should be transparent to you the reader with most all newer browsers.<p>

<b>Foreword</b><p>

     Locomotive 60,000, the subject of the present publication, was designed 
and built by The Baldwin Loco-motive Works as an experiment to ascertain the 
gain in efficiency by the use of high pressure steam and high ratios of 
expansion. Opportunity was also taken to try out certain novel details of 
construction.<p>
<A HREF="p2.jpg"> <b>Locomotive Number 60,000: </b>This illustration shows the general arrangement of the cylinders and steam 
chests, and also of the two valve motions on the right-hand side, which 
control the steam distribution to the center and right-hand cylinders 
respectively. The absence of any machinery in front of the cylinders should be 
noted.</a><p>
  Through the courtesy of the Pennsylvania Railroad the locomotive was 
submitted to an extensive program of tests on their locomotive test plant at 
Altoona, and it was subsequently given road tests on this line and on a number 
of other prominent railroads. The essential details of these tests are now 
available.<p>

The present publication consists of four parts:-<p>

<A HREF="part01.html"><b>I. Design and Construction of Locomotive 60,000</b></a><br>

<b>By PAUL T. WARNER.</b><p>

<A HREF="part02.html"><b>II. Discussion of Test Results</b></a><br>

<b>By LAWFORD H. FRY.</b><p>

<A HREF="part03.html"><b>III. Extracts from Test Report of Pennsylvania Railroad.</b></a><p>

<A HREF="part04.html"><b>IV. Extracts from Reports Covering Road Tests on Various Lines.</b></a><p>

   In presenting the record of the performance of Locomotive 60,000 on the 
Altoona Plant, no special claims are made, but information obtained by 
impartial observers is made available so that the reader may form his own 
judgment as to the success of the experiment-. The Test Report is supplemented 
by only such comment as appears to be necessary to set the results in a proper 
perspective in relation to those obtained with other loco-motives. In addition 
to discussing the more important phases of the performance, it gives a 
considerable amount of the data observed in making the tests.  It is believed 
that this will be welcomed by all who are interested in the technical side of 
locomotive engineering, as it will permit them to make their own further 
analysis of the performance.<p>
