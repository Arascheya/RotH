<h2>Reports on Tests of Locomotive 60,000</h2>
</center>
   38.  Tests have been made of a Baldwin three-cylinder compound freight 
locomotive which has a number of unusual features.  It is of the 4-10-2 type 
with a working boiler pressure of 350 pounds per square inch, and is fitted 
with a Worthington feedwater heater, Duplex stoker and type A superheater.  
The boiler has a water-tube firebox, and forward of the firebox is of the 
usual firetube type with a 50-element superheater.<p>

    The cylinders, which are all of the same diameter and stroke, 27 inches by 
32 inches, are compounded.  The middle cylinder is the high-pressure.  Its 
exhaust passes into a receiver in the cylinder casting which is connected with 
the steam chests of the two low-pressure cylinders. <p>

   39.  All of the tests were made with run-of-mine bituminous coal from the 
Keystone Coal and Coke Company's Crows Nest Mine at Hempfield, Westmoreland 
County, Pennsylvania.  This coal is used at the test plant as standard freight 
locomotive coal.<p>

    Average analysis of the coal was as follows:--<p>

     40.  Locomotive 60,000 was operated on the test plant without change in 
the counterbalancing, and speeds up to 200 revolutions per minute (37.5 miles 
per hour), were attained without excessive vibration.  Two-cylinder 
locomotives must be specially counterbalanced for the test plant to be able to 
operate satisfactorily at speeds above 160 revolutions per minute. <p>

                <h2>Boiler Performance</h2>  

     41.  In the following discussion of boiler performance, a distinction is 
made between the performance of Heater the boiler proper and the combined 
performance of boiler and feedwater heater.  The items "equivalent 
evaporation" and "boiler efficiency" are based on the heat transferred in the 
boiler proper.  In the items "moist steam per hour" and "superheated steam per 
hour" the work of boiler and feedwater heater cannot be separated, and 
therefore these items are not directly comparable with similar items in 
reports of tests of boilers not equipped with feedwater heaters.<p>

     42.  Draft, firebox and smokebox temperatures are Draft, plotted in <A HREF="fig16.gif"><b>Fig. 16</b></a> and <A HREF="fig17.gif"><b>Fig. 17</b></a> in relation to the rate firing.  There is nothing unusual about 
these drafts and temperatures. <p>

     43.  Locomotive 60,000 has a grate area of 82.5 square feet.  The maximum 
rate of firing reached in the test was 150 pounds of coal as fired per square 
foot of grate per hour, which is equal to 12,388 pounds of coal per hour.<p>

<A HREF="fig16.gif"> <b>Fig. 16:</a></b> <i>Relation between Draft & Rate of Firing</i><p>
<A HREF="fig17.gif"> <b>Fig. 17:</a></b>  <i>Relation between Firebox & Smokebox Temperatures and Rate of Firing</i><p>

     No attempt was made to work the locomotive at a higher rate, because at 
150 pounds per square foot per hour the evaporation was very large and the 
power output of the locomotive had reached the maximum capacity of the test 
plant.<p>

     44.  In all tests the values of the boiler pressure averaged throughout 
each test ranged between 343 and 350 pounds per square inch. <p>

     45.  The evaporation in moist steam per hour in relation to the rate of 
firing per square foot of grate is plotted in <A HREF="fig18.gif"><b>Fig. 18</b></a>.  The maximum 
evaporative capacity of Locomotive 60,000 was 69,695 pounds of moist steam per 
hour.  This includes the exhaust steam reclaimed by the feedwater heater.  The 
corresponding maximum equivalent evaporation was 84,184 pounds per hour.  At 
this rate the steam pressure and temperature were well maintained, and as the 
rate of firing was only 135 pounds of dry coal per hour, this evaporation 
could undoubtedly have been increased had not the locomotive already reached 
the maximum capacity of the test plant. <p>

<A HREF="fig21.gif"> <b>Fig. 21:</a></b>  <i>Relation between Boiler Efficiency and Rate of Firing </i><p>

     46.  The total equivalent evaporation is plotted (<A HREF="fig19.gif"><b>Fig. 19</b></a>) in relation to 
the rate of firing per square foot of grate per hour, while the equivalent 
evaporation per pound of dry coal is plotted against the rate of firing per 
square foot of grate per hour in <A HREF="fig20.gif"><b>Fig. 20</b></a>.<p>

     47.  The boiler efficiency in per cent is plotted in <A HREF="fig21.gif"><b>Fig. 21</b></a> against the 
rate of firing, and in <A HREF="fig22.gif"><b>Fig. 22</b></a> heat balances are plotted showing the 
distribution of the heat losses at various rates of firing.  From these the 
efficiency of combustion and the efficiency of heat absorption have been 
computed, and are plotted in <A HREF="fig23.gif"><b>Fig. 23</b></a> against the rate of firing.  The 
efficiency of heat absorption is practically constant at about 82 per cent for 
all rates of firing; the decrease in boiler efficiency, as the rate of firing 
is increased, being due to a decrease in the efficiency of combustion. <p>

     48.  Locomotive 60,000 was equipped with a Worthington heater having a 
capacity of 60,000 pounds per hour which is large enough to supply all of the 
feedwater required in the heaviest tests.  The rise in feedwater temperature 
in the heater ranged from 127 to 169 degrees F. and the heat saving from 7.4 
to 10.4 per cent. <p>

     The temperature of the water delivered by the heater was from 30 to 13 
degrees below the temperature corresponding to the pressure of the exhaust 
steam at the heater.<p>
<h2>Engine Performance</h2>                                                   
                                                                                          
       49.   The maximum indicated horse-power developed by Locomotive 60,000 
was 4515.  This was obtained in test No. 7923 with a cut-off of 80 per cent in 
the high, and 50 per cent in the low-pressure cylinders, the speed being 200 
revolutions per minute or 37.5 miles per hour.  This is the greatest indicated 
horse-power ever developed on the test Plant.<p>
                                                                                          
       50.  A curve showing the average water rate at all speeds and cut-offs 
is plotted in <A HREF="fig24.gif"><b>Fig. 24</b></a> in relation to the indicated horse-power. This curve  is  
flatter than that obtained with any single expansion locomotive.  For all cut-
offs between 50/20 and 80/50 per cent, and all speeds from 80 to 160 
revolutions per minute, the water rate lies between 14.2 and 15.2 <p>

 pounds per indicated horse-power hour.  For a cut-off of 90 per cent in the 
high and 70 per cent in the low-pressure cylinders, the water rate is 16.3 
pounds at 80 revolutions per minute and 16.6 pounds at 120 revolutions per 
minute.</i><p>                                            

     Examination of the detail figures, item 46, page 57-shows that Locomotive 
60,000 has its best water rates at speeds of 120 and 160 revolutions per 
minute, or 22.5 and 30 miles per hour.  In test No. 7913 with cut-offs of 70 
per cent in the high and 40 per cent in the low-pressure cylinders, and at a 
speed of 120  revolutions per minute, the water rate was 14.2 pounds per 
indicated horse-power, which is lower than that of any other locomotive ever 
tested on The plant.<p>                                           
                                                                         
     51. Figs. 25 to 32 show typical indicator cards at representative speeds 
and cut-offs, while Figs, 33 to 41 show sets of combined indicator cards for 
all cut-offs at 80 revolutions per minute, for all speeds at a cut-off of 
70/40 per cent, and for the test at 200 revolutions per minute and cut-off of 
60/30 per cent.  These combined cards have been prepared to show the relation 
of cylinder clearance to total volume, and the action of the steam between the 
high, and low-pressure cylinders was practically the same as is usually 
observed in locomotives using lower boiler pressure.<br>

<A HREF="fig3132.gif"> <b>Fig. 31, 32</a></b><p> 

      52.  The number of expansions for Locomotive 60,000 are plotted in <A HREF="fig42.gif"><b>Fig. 42</b></a>.  The figures have been calculated for all tests at 80 revolutions per 
minute, using the method given by R. C. H. Heck in his book on the Steam 
Engine. <p>                                                                      

      53.  Pressures at release and at the end of expansion at a speed of 80 
revolutions per minute have been plotted.  In spite of the higher initial 
pressure of Locomotive 60,000, the pressures at release are not abnormally 
high, while the pressures at the end of expansion are slightly less than 
normal.  This is due to the high ratio of expansion in Locomotive 60,000. <p>
                                
      54.  At a speed of 80 revolutions per minute and at all cut-offs the 
high-pressure cylinder develops slightly more work than is developed in each 
of the low-pressure cylinders, while at 120 revolutions per minute the 
position is reversed and the high-pressure develops slightly less work than 
each low-pressure cylinder.  As the speed is increased the percentage of work 
developed in the high-pressure cylinder falls off rapidly.  The difference is 
greater with short cut-offs than with long, and as shown by the cards in <A HREF="fig41.gif"><b>Fig. 41</b></a>, at a speed of 200 revolutions per minute and a cut-off of 60/30 per cent, 
the work in the high-pressure cylinder is about one-tenth of that of one of 
the low-pressure cylinders.  Nevertheless, under these <p>

relation to the draw-bar pull.  It appears to vary with the draw-bar pull and 
to be independent of the speed.  There is no noticeable difference between the 
machine efficiency of Locomotive 60,000 and that of other modern locomotives 
which have been tested on the Altoona test plant. <p>

Locomotive 60,000 per draw-bar horse-power is plotted in <A HREF="fig45.gif"> <b>Fig. 45.</a></b><p>

      The coal rate of Locomotive 60,000 is approximately 2.5 pounds at the 
middle of the working range, increasing somewhat at the lower rates and at 
rates above 2000 draw-bar horse-power. A rate of  3.25 pounds of dry coal per 
draw-bar horse-power hour is reached at the maximum output of about 3600 draw-
bar horse-power.<p>

                       <h2>Throttling Tests</h2>

      60.  Five tests were made to determine the effect on the economy of the 
locomotive of a reduction of the pressure in the branch pipe by throttling.  
The method of making these tests was to throttle the steam at the steam chest 
to 200 or 250 pounds, and to lengthen the cut-off until the draw-bar pull was 
the same as in a previous test at the same speed with full throttle. The 
results of these five tests are shown in the table on page 59 in comparison 
with the corresponding full throttle tests.  The following table shows a 
comparison of the principal items on a percentage basis:<p>

     The coal rate per indicated horse-power hour shown by these tests, 
indicates that throttling so as to reduce the branch pipe pressure by 100 to 
150 pounds per square inch has little effect on the overall efficiency of the 
locomotive.  In one test the coal rate is not affected by throttling, in one 
it is increased and in two reduced. Theoretical considerations lead to the 
expectation that the water rate would be increased, and this is shown in all 
five tests.  Also, in all five tests the machine efficiency was increased. <p>

                    <h2>Road Tests of Locomotive Number 60,000</h2>

     Subsequent to  the completion of the tests on the stationary plant of the  
Pennsvlvania Railroad at Altoona, Locomotive 60,000 was given a series of road 
tests, which were made possible through the courtesy and cooperation of 
several railroad companies.  These tests gave results quite as remarkable as 
those obtained on the stationary plant, demonstrating not only the high 
thermal and mechanical efficiency of the locomotive, but also its adaptability 
to a wide range of operating conditions.<p>

     A general schedule of the road tests is as follows:<br>

     From October 13 to 16, and October 25 to November 4, 1926, the locomotive 
was in service on the Pennsylvania Railroad, operating on the low-grade 
freight line between Enola (Harrisburg) and West Morrisville, Pennsylvania.<p>

     From November 16 to December 30, 1926, the locomotive was in service on 
the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, operating on the Cumberland, Connellsville and 
Pittsburgh Divisions of that road. <p>

<A HREF="p1.jpg"> <b> Locomotive 60,000 on Exhibition at Chicago</a></b><p>      

     From January 24 to February 3, 1927, the locomotive was in service on the 
Erie Railroad, operating from Elmira, New York, to Chicago, with one extra 
round trip between Kent and Marion, Ohio. <p>
 
    From February 4 to February 8, the locomotive was on exhibition at the 
Union Station, Chicago.  On the latter date, the locomotive was received by 
the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, and until February 23, was in 
service on the Beardstown Division of that road.<p>

    On February 24, the locomotive was run to Fort Madison, Iowa, where it was 
used in a series of track stress tests on the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe 
Railway.  It was then run to Clovis, New Mexico, hauling tonnage trains over 
the Santa, Fe; and during the period March 13 to May 2, was in service between 
Clovis and Belen.  From May 2 to May 5, the locomotive was en route from 
Clovis to El Paso, Texas, on the Southern Pacific Lines.<p>

    From May 12 to June 28 the locomotive was operated in a series of runs 
between El Paso, Texas, and Tucson, Arizona, on the Southern Pacific Lines, 
burning coal as fuel.  It was then taken to Sacramento, California, and there 
equipped for oil burning.  From August 31 to November 20 the locomotive was 
used in both freight and passenger service on the Southern Pacific Lines, 
between Roseville, California, and Sparks, Nevada.<p>

    Subsequent to these tests the locomotive was moved to Portland, Oregon, 
where it was exhibited from December 25 to December 28.  It was then moved to 
the Great Northern Shops at Everett, Washington, and on January 7, 1928, left 
that point with a tonnage train, eastbound over the Great Northern Railway.  
On January 17 it arrived at Minot, North Dakota.  As oil fuel was not 
available east of this point, the locomotive was moved "dead" to St. Paul, 
Minnesota, where it was changed back to a coal burner.  From February 5 to 
February 9 it made two round trips between Minneapolis and Superior, 
Wisconsin.  It was then transferred to the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy 
Railroad, and was operated over that line in freight service, arriving at 
Chicago on February 17. <p>

     From February 23 to February 25 the locomotive was en route light from 
Chicago to Eddystone, over the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad.<p>

    An inspection of the locomotive, after its arrival at Eddystone, showed it 
to be in excellent condition.  The wear in the cylinders and steam chests was 
practically negligible.  The shoes and wedges, which were of iron, cast in the 
Baldwin foundry, showed wear as given in the following table:<p>

     Through the courtesy of the railroad companies over whose lines 
Locomotive 60,000 was operated, the principal results of the tests are 
presented in the following pages.<p>

                            <h2>Pennsylvania Railroad </h2>

     The locomotive was tested in heavy freight service between Enola and West 
Morrisville, Pennsylvania, 133 miles.  This is a low-grade line, over which 
the prevailing loaded movement is eastbound.  The ruling grade against loaded 
trains is 26 miles long, and averages 0.24 per cent; but allowing for 
curvature, the ruling grade is practically 0.3 per cent.<p>

     Preliminary test runs were made on the ruling grade, on which, in
addition to dynamometer and coal records, indicator cards, and temperature and
pressure readings were taken at five-minute intervals.  The locomotive was
operated with full throttle and fixed cut-off, and an attempt was made to keep
the speed as nearly uniform as possible by entering the test stretch at a
speed at which it was estimated the train could be hauled.  The figures for 
steam per indicated horse-power on these tests, agree closely with those 
obtained on the stationary test plant.  The results of these preliminary tests 
are given in the following table:<p>

     After the preliminary tests on the ruling grade, four round trips were 
made between Enola and  West Morrisville.  No indicator cards were taken, but 
the coal and water were measured and complete dynamometer car records were 
made.  The road was divided into sections over which the grade is 
approximately uniform, and the coal used was measured over each of these 
sections.  The water was measured only at starting and stopping of the test, 
and at water filling stations. <p><p>
                                                               
     On three of the eastbound trips the train tonnage approximated 7,000, 
while on the fourth it approximated 7,500.  The following table gives data 
covering the trips in both directions:
