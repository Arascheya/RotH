<b>Reader Please Note:</b><br>
    <b> The following definitions are collected from various railroad
books I have read, mostly dealing with the technical aspects of
operating and maintaining railroads and rolling stock.  These terms
are not original with me, but have originated elsewhere.  When you
steal one person's work, that is called plagiarism.  When you steal
work from more than one person, that is called research.  This list
is by no means complete, and contains only a small fraction of
terms used in the industry.  I selected these definitions because
I felt that they would be the terms most commonly encountered by
the average rail fan.  Some of the books that I have read are quite
old.  As a consequence, some of the terms listed herein may be
obsolete, and thus be of historical value only.  Enjoy!</b><p>
