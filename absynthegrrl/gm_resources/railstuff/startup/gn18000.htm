The following short story I originally discovered while browsing the USENET group, "bit.listserv.railroad".  I thought it was such a good representation of a nearly lost art (preparing a steam locomotive for a day's work), that I wrote the author,
<B>Phil Jern (pjern@indy.net)</B> to ask if I could publish it on my page.  He agreed.  I hope you enjoy reading, "How to Boot a Steam Locomotive" as much as I did.<BR>

Phil Jern (pjern@indy.net) in the cab of ex-Florida East Coast #153, a 4-6-2 "Pacific type" steam locomotive built by Alco in 1922.  This is the locomotive Phil was working on when he wrote this story.  The 153 is currently stored inoperable awaiting
repairs.<BR>
