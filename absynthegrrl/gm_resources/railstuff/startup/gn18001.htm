HOW TO BOOT A STEAM LOCOMOTIVE<BR>
-or-<BR>
How to hostle without really tiring<BR>
<BR>
(c) Phil Jern - 1990.  This story takes place in the bad old days of 1982-83 at a certain unnamed railroad museum.<BR>
<BR>
It's 3:30 in the morning, as my alarm goes off.  Ouch.  Today, it's
my turn to get old 153 up to speed for Sunday operations.  I drag myself out of bed, bleary-eyed, and shower quickly.  An hour later, the gravel in the parking lot crunches beneath my tires as I drive up to the gate of the museum.<BR>
<BR>
I take my coffee and rolls with me as I open the trainshed, and flick on the lights.  There, three feet away, are the cylinders of the 153, a 1922 product of the American Locomotive Company.  The sight never fails to astonish me.  One hundred and
eighty-four tons of people-magnet, as my friend Al is fond of describing her.  I walk down the left side of the locomotive, admiring her Brobdingnagian proportions inside the building, and climb up the gangway into the cab.  Time to get to work.<BR>
<BR>
I check the water glass and check the bottom try-cock.  Nothing.  Guess the last fireman didn't fill the boiler with the injector before shutting down, as he was supposed to.  Maybe there's a leak.  I open the front blowdown valve for a second, and am
rewarded with a gush of water from the front of the locomotive.  OK, it's just a little low.  Climbing down the engineer's side, I grab a firehose, and connect it to the rear blowdown.  Back in the cab, I open the rear blowdown, and climb down again to
turn on the water.<BR>
<BR>
Back up the ladder to the top of the tender.  I check the dipstick,
and note the number of gallons of Bunker C fuel oil remaining, and check it against the log from shutdown last week.  No leaks there.  Further back, I open the tank lid, and peer down into the murk.  The water level is only about 5 feet down, so there
aren't any serious leaks in the tank.  When you work with steam locomotives, especially old ones, you tend to worry a lot about leaks.  I grab another firehose that hangs from the ceiling back here, and drape it down into the tank.  Down the aft ladder,
and over to the valve to start filling up the tender.  Forward, I grab our Rube Goldberg stack fan, and climb up over the pilot, up the steps, and up on the smokebox.  After removing the stack cover, and stowing it in the notch provided in the running
board, I set the fan in the stack to provide a small amount of draft for the boiler.  Toss the electrical cord over the side, and climb back down to the ground to plug it in.<BR>
<BR>
Back to the cab.  Looped under the fireman's seat is an electrical cord.  I uncoil it and drape it over to the wall, and plug it in.  I climb up into the cab, open the engineer's seatbox, and remove a trouble light.  Plugging it into an electrical outlet
in the cab, I open the firebox door and peer inside.  There is a huge "bone" of unburned carbon in the front of the firebox, right in front of the burner.  Damn.  I go out to the tool car (an old Southern boxcar) and grab a pickaxe and a bucket.  Back up
in the cab, I hang the trouble light right outside the firebox door, toss the pickaxe into the firebox and set the bucket on the floor in front of the door.  Feet first, I squeeze into the firebox, feeling for the floor, being careful not to dislodge any
of the firebrick if I can help it.  Inside, I reach outside for the trouble light, locate the pickaxe and break up the carboniferous mass.  I toss the loose pieces out the door and into the bucket, and use the light to inspect the firebox, looking for
loose or leaky staybolts, making sure the firebrick lining the sides of the firebox is in reasonably good condition, and checking the burner for obstructions.  All I find is a couple of loose bricks, so I replace them, push my tools back out the door,
and climb back out.  I look back inside to make sure I didn't leave anything inside.  Once, I left the pickaxe inside, and all that was left at the end of the day was the head.<BR>
<BR>
I check my pocket watch (have to look the part, you know). 5 AM.  Time to light a fire.<BR>
<BR>
Starting up an oil-fired steam locomotive is a tricky process.  First, everything is steam-operated, including the tank heater that warms the fuel so it will flow, so it's not just a matter of lighting it up and waiting.  I check the water glass, and see
that there is now half an inch showing.  Enough.  I shut the rear blowdown valve, climb down, shut off the water, and disconnect the hose.<BR>
<BR>
On the back of the tender is a 55 gallon drum of kerosene.  I climb up and open the valve at the drum, and climb back down into the cab.  I unchain the kerosene burner from the brakestand, and set it up, pointed into the firebox. I connect a hose to the
kerosene line coming down off the tender, and another hose to an air compressor outside the building.  I take a softball-sized piece of waste, and soak it in kerosene for a minute.  Placing it on a shelf of firebrick just inside the firedoor, I whip out
a book of matches and light them (yes, the whole book).  I then light the waste, and let it get started burning, plug in the burner, and start it up.  After a little finagling with the fuel/air mixture, I get a fine mist of kerosene and air that ignites
with a WHOOMP! sound.  It's 5:30 AM.  The burner is now beginning to warm up the engine, and I can take a break.  Time for my coffee and rolls.<BR>
