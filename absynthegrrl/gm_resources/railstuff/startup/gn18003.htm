I take another break at this point and chew the fat with Frank, talking about the weather, his grandchildren, and whatever else strikes us. Frank is a retired DC-8 pilot, and has taken to volunteering at the Museum to keep himself busy.  Of course, we
both keep an ear cocked for the burner and frequently check the water glass.  Eventually, Frank leaves for breakfast, and I climb back up into the cab.  Five pounds on the steam gauge.  Good enough to start the blower, I figure, and get some real draft
through the boiler.  I walk out the left running board, reach down and yank the plug for the stack fan out of the wall, and reach up to pull the fan out of the stack.  Sure is hot here!<BR>
<BR>
Lowering the fan to the ground, I go back to the cab and crack the blower valve open.  I am balancing a need to draft the engine with the need to not use steam profligately.  I am watching the flames from the kerosene burner as I turn the valve, trying
to get the draft up enough so that the flames are sucked into the flues a little bit in order to greatly increase the heating area (and thus make steam quicker), but not so much that I am pulling an excessive amount of cold air into the firebox through
its vents or the door.  This maneuver is complicated by the fact that the blower valve is right at hand in the cab, where it should be, and the blower itself is forty feet away under the stack, which leads to a 3 to 5 second delay between moving the
valve and seeing a response of any kind.<BR>
<BR>
I finally get things balanced enough to start making preparations to light the main burner.  Fuel oil passes from the tender, through a 2 inch pipe with flexible joints to run alongside the firebox on the left hand side inside a 4 inch sleeve that
functions as an inline fuel line heater.  I start the process by opening the fuel valve on the tender, and the steam valve to the inline heater on the locomotive.  Fuel will flow down the pipes to the back of the main burner, where only the burner valve
will hold it back.<BR>
<BR>
Eight pounds on the steam gauge.  Things are happening faster now, with the increased draft and intensity of the fire.  Wisps of steam curl around most of the valves that are open to the outside, as it leaks in small quantities past 60 year old valve
seats.  A steady drip of condensation is running from the exhaust line from the fuel tank heater at the rear of the tender.  The smell of hot oil is becoming richer.  Water drips from the drain cocks of the air compressors on the left side of the engine.
 The hollow whooshing sound of the blower adds to the noise level.<BR>
<BR>
By now, it's 8:30 AM and I have been up for about 5 hours.  My legs are starting to feel rubbery from all the climbing up and down over the engine.  The steam gauge inches towards 10, and I get out some waste and soak it in kerosene.  From on top of the
tender, I draw a ten foot long metal shovel with a small blade, and set my piece of waste on the end.  Closing the blower valve to prevent shocking the boiler with cold air, I shut off the kerosene supply to the small burner.  The silence is striking.
Since I lit the burner, its muted roar has become the constant audible background to my work.  Now, as I pull it away from the firedoor, all that can be heard is the hissing of steam in the heaters and the occasional expansion creaks of the boiler.  I
set my long shovel on the bottom edge of the firedoor, and light this second "wick".  Sliding it carefully into the firebox, I take close aim, and toss it towards the front end of the firebox shooting for a spot right in front of the main burner.  It
lands about ten inches away, directly in line with the burner.  Good enough.<BR>
<BR>
This is the trickiest part of the whole affair.  If I haven't gotten the Bunker C fuel oil hot enough, I am going to have a very difficult time indeed trying to light this burner.  Simultaneously, I open the blower valve about half a turn, and open the
steam valve to the main burner about a full turn.  I look in the peephole in the firedoor to make sure I haven't blown out my burning piece of waste, and then step away fron the door.  I grasp the firing valve lever and open it by pulling it about four
inches towards me, allowing the fuel to run down into the burner, where it will be scattered into a fine mist by the steam jets that surround the orifice.<BR>
<BR>
A jet of dark red, sooty flame blows out the peephole of the firedoor as the explosion rattles every loose item in the cab.  I push the firing valve back about two inches, and begin opening the blower valve to create enough draft to supply oxygen for the
fire, watching the color brighten towards orange.  I look out at the stack, and see that there is still a column of opaque, black smoke issuing forth.  The further I open the valve, the more oxygen I am supplying via draft, and presently the exhaust
begins to clear.  The fire is now a bright yellowish white, and I examine it through the peephole, adjusting the steam valve for the burner to try and fan the spray of fuel to provide an optimum bloom of flame that just about fills the firebox but is not
so energetic that the flame front gets ripped away from the burner, so that it keeps reigniting from sheer heat, a condition leads to a series of hollow sounding explosions and a great loss in efficiency.  Several rounds of adjustments later, everything
is stable, there is a light haze in the exhaust and we are on the way.  The steam gauge will begin to rise more rapidly, with the much greater thermal energy available from this fire.<BR>
<BR>
I examine the water glass.  Up to this point, the level of water had been rising due to expansion, but we will now begin to evaporate water at a much greater rate, and the level will begin to fall.  So far, the water is about halfway up the glass, which
is good for this point in the process.  I doublecheck by opening the middle try-cock and indeed, get a mixture of steam and hot water, indicating that there is not a bubble or blockage giving me a false reading in the water glass.  I proceed to secure
the kerosene blower and its assorted paraphernalia, and grab my bucket of bones as I climb down from the cab.<BR>
