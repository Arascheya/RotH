It's eighty degrees outside, and it strikes me in the face as a cool breeze after the cab of the locomotive.  I go into the restroom, grab a towel and soak it in cold water, to wrap around my head and face for a few minutes.  I take the bucket of carbon
rocks to the trash dumpster, heave them in, and take the bucket and pickaxe back to the tool car.<BR>
<BR>
As I look around the museum grounds, I see that some of the other volunteers have begun to arrive.  Shirly, who runs the ticket office, is here with her husband, who is currently the President of the museum's Board of Directors, and John, who takes care
of the Silver Crescent, both say hello.  I return the greetings and head back to the engine.<BR>
<BR>
Already, the boiler pressure has reached 25 pounds.  As I watch, I can see the needle rising.  I grab a bucket of feedwater treatment (chemicals that reduce scaling and rust inside the boiler) and climb up over the tender and head to the hatch.  The
water level is now less than a foot from the top, and I dip the bucket and mix the chemicals with a loose piece of pipe.<BR>
<BR>
Pouring the mixture into the tank, I head back to the cab and check the water column.  Forty pounds of steam, and the glass is now showing about a half an inch of water.<BR>
<BR>
I open the main feed valves from the tender, and pull back the lever on the fireman's injector.  Using a feedwater injector is a tricky business; you must pull the handle back and watch the overflow pipe beneath you for water, so you will know when the
injector is primed, then pull all the way back on the handle to start injecting water through the feedwater pipes into the boiler through the check valves, which are mounted on the front of the boiler, where the water is cooler, and where the feedwater
won't cold-shock the hottest parts of the boiler, near the rear.<BR>
<BR>
Right now, I get only steam from the overflow pipe, which is what I expect.  The residual water in the pickup lines is far too hot to inject, (since the injector works on a temperature differential, the cold feedwater causes the steam to condense,
producing a vacuum, which is then used to force water into the boiler under pressure), so I close the overflow valve on the front of the injector and open the handle, which causes the steam in the injectors to be forced back through the four inch water
supply line to the tender, pushing the residual water in the feed lines back into the tender, and producing a massive amount of bubbling in the tender.  I can feel the tender dancing under the force of the backflow.  I shut off the injector, and cool
water from the tender rushes back into the feedlines.<BR>
<BR>
Fifty-five pounds on the steam gauge, and I reopen the overflow shutoff valves, prime the injector, and open it all the way.  Cool water rushes into the boiler along its three inch diameter feedlines, in the process sounding like an enormous toilet
flush.  The steam gauge stops its steady advance, as I am putting too much cold water into the boiler for it to recover at such a low pressure, but the water level is rising.  When it reaches 2/3 of the glass, I shut the injector.  I can now busy myself
with other details while steam continues to build.<BR>
<BR>
I grab a stick of grease, and walk around the engine greasing the main rod bearings.  As the chore is completed, I look at my watch, and realize it is nearing 10 AM.  Back in the cab, the steam gauge is approaching 100 pounds, nearly enough to move the
engine if need be, but there's nearly an hour left.  I adjust the burner, blower, and firing valve, and climb up to the engineer's seatbox I open the steam feed to the hydrostatic lubricator, and adjust the flow to the air compressors' feed line.  I
reach up to the steam turret, and open the feed valve for the air compressors.  This action is rewarded by an immediate chorus of thumping and hissing as the air compressors start their pistons and begin driving air into the main reservoir for the brakes
and power reverse.  I check the water glass, note that it is back down to a half glass, and start the injector on the engineer's side.<BR>
<BR>
I climb down out of the cab and shut the drain valves for the air compressors, and watch them run for a few seconds.  There is about 200 pounds of reciprocating mass in each compressor, so it's important to keep an eye on them so that if there is a
problem, they can be shut down before they do some serious damage.  I go around and shut off the various air drain valves as well.<BR>
<BR>
Back in the cab, I open the valve for the electrical generator, causing a jet-like whine as the turbine that drives it spools up.  The lights in the cab come on, as well as the headlight, and I can at last cast free from ground-based power.  The water
glass is full, and I shut off the engineer's injector, and watch as the air pressure comes up in the brake system and main reservoir.  Steam pressure is approaching 130 pounds, and I open the cylinder cocks and set the brakes.  To warm the cylinders, I
open the throttle just a hair, allowing steam to travel from the throttle valve in the steam dome, through the dry pipe inside the boiler, and through the valves to the cylinders.  I exercise the power reverse to admit steam to both sides of the
cylinders, and then set it back to neutral and close the throttle.<BR>
<BR>
I hear a splashing sound at the rear of the tender, indicating that it is now full.  I step down, and shut off the valve, the climb up the rear ladder to stow the hose and close the cistern hatch.<BR>
<BR>
The locomotive is now ready to move.  I climb back into the cab and blow a short blast on the whistle, a prearranged signal that lets the crew for the first run know that she is ready.  Steve and Mark show up, and I make a big deal out of turning the
locomotive over to them.  My job is finished, for now.<BR>
<BR>
I am dead tired, unwilling to even expend the effort to climb down out of the cab.  Steve and his crew begin to move the engine out into the sunlight, as I wonder why I put myself through this every third Sunday.  I am standing in the gangway as we roll
out of the building with the bell ringing, and I see a little girl with her hands over her ears, mouth in a little O, halfway hiding behind her father, and I am reminded.<BR>
