It takes a long time to heat 5000 gallons of water to boiling, so I finish my roll, and get out the oil can.  There are a few hundred lubrication points on a steam locomotive, and as engineers and firemen have, from time immemorial, I begin the ritual of
"oiling around".  Starting under the fireman's side of the cab, I oil the trailing truck journals, springs and support bearings.  Moving forward, there are the spring lube pads on the drivers, the air compressor piston rods, the crosshead guides, valve
gear and piston rod packing.  At the front, the leading truck bearings, support bearings and slides all get the 80 weight treatment.<BR>
<BR>
I work my way up on top of the pilot and the steps, along the left side of the boiler to the bell mounting, and the air compressor top ends, where I unscrew the caps and pour about a pint of oil into each reservoir.  At the very rear of the boiler, I
step up on the handrail, and lube the electrical generator.  I duck in the front door of the cab on the fireman's side, to oil the firing valve shaft and gears.  Refilling the oil can, I open up the hydrostatic lubricator on the backhead above the brake
gauges on the engineer's side.  There are five feeds on this instrument, but only one fill point.  I pour about a quart of oil in, until it starts to overflow.  Taking a rag and wiping up, I replace the filler cap and exit out the front door onto the
right side running board.<BR>
<BR>
A few drops of oil for the automatic bell ringer and I head down the stairs at the front, and repeat the process for the running gear on the right side of the engine, heading back towards the cab.  The power reverse gear is the only additional mechanism
on this side.  I pick up a larger oil can and work my way around the tender, filling all the journals and checking the condition of the axle packing and bearing brasses.  Back in the cab, I complete the oiling job by lifting the apron between the
locomotive and tender, and oiling the bearing surfaces for the drawbar.  I jump back down and refill the oil cans from a 55-gallon drum equipped with a hand pump.<BR>

By now, the kerosene burner has warmed the boiler to the point where the first bubbles of steam are forming above the crownsheet.  In order for the Bunker C fuel oil to flow through the two inch pipes to the main burner in the front of the firebox, it
needs to be heated to a little over 110 degrees. (Cold, it has the consistency of jello).  To that end, I reach up and open the tank heater valve on the front of the tender, to ensure that as soon as the boiler is producing steam, some of it will start
to warm its main fuel supply.<BR>
<BR>
Up to now, the only noise has been the dull roar of the kerosene burner and whatever banging around I caused as I went around oiling things.  Now, if you are standing in the right place, you can hear the water in the boiler starting to boil, and the
occasional creak as the metal expands.  The beast is beginning, ever so faintly, to live.  Just a stirring, but it is portentious.<BR>
<BR>
There is as yet no perceptible movement on the big brass steam gauge in the center of the backhead.  I need about 10 pounds of steam pressure in order to light the main burner, and no less than 50 to 70 pounds of pressure to get an injector to pick up
and deliver feedwater to the boiler.  This is why I was so concerned about having enough water in the boiler in the first place: it's a balancing act.  Too much water, and it takes too long to heat up.  Too little, and you risk not raising enough steam
to inject more water into the boiler before the water level drops so low that you uncover the crownsheet and blow yourself to kingdom come.<BR>
<BR>
7 AM.  I hear another car in the lot as I fill the sand dome on top of the boiler.  It's Frank, bringing the ice and Gatorade for the crew cooler on the tender.  It's about time.  It's getting distinctly warm inside the trainshed at this point, since I
have already burned about fifteen gallons of kerosene and intend to burn about thirty more.  I adjust the flow on the burner up a notch as the steam gauge just begins, barely! to move off the zero peg.<BR>
