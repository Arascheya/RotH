<p class="regtxt5">Jossyth is mildly addictive, similar to marijuana. It is a fragrant plant, looking like the common thistle, whose leaves burn with a sweet smoke that induces an energetic calm, similar to mild cocaine mixed with strong marijuana. The brilliant purpler flowers last a long time after being cut and give off a delicate and soothing fragrance. The seeds contain a higher dose of the relaxing compounds, making them ideal for alcohol based tinctures to reklieve pain and inflamation. The roots concentrate the stimulant and make an excellent revitalizing tea. Commercially, they are used in several popular drinks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jossyth is common to theRealm of the Forever City and figures heavily in the local economy.</p>
