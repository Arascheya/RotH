<p class="pagecaption">Kavla Vine</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kavla vines are a dusty grey-green with similar colored leaves. The stems are tough and fibrous making them extremely difficult to cut or chop. The sap is a strong skin irritant, raising welts and blisters on exposed skin. The smoke produced when burning it is a lung and eye irritant, almost as toxic as mustard gas.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The flowers are very similar to passion vine flowers, large colorful, and intricately beautiful. Their pollen is a mild hallucinogenic. If the pollen is harvested and soaked in alcohol, it will produce a very potent hallucinogen. The roots can be processed to produce opiate-like narcotics. The alchemists at the <a href="../../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">Asylum</a> are quite adept at this.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The sap is a strong toxin. Ingestion will cause burns and blistering at all points of contact. It can be rendered down with alcohol and ammonia to produce a strong poison or an anesthetic, depending on mix and process.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The seed pods can be processed to produce a coffee-like drink, high in flavor and caffeine. This requires the seed pods to be eaten by pigs. The outer husks are stripped away in this process and the inner shells and seeds are excreted. These excretions are digested by large slugs, which strips off the hard shell and leaves the inner seed. This is washed, dried, roasted, nd ground. The result is a strong coffee-like drink with robust flavor and solid caffiene kick.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The best Kavla is produced in the pocket realm of the <a href="../../places/planescape/asylumflowers.htm">Asylum</a> that is in the <a href="">Discord</a>. This was the pocket realm that belonged to <a href="../../npcs/iskandera.htm">Arascheya Iskandera</a>'s mother. The pigs and slugs roam the dark forests, eating the fallen kavla fruits and depositing the seeds. Small monkey-like mammals gather the seeds and hoard them in still pools along the jungle rivers that snake through the realm. This realm has many similarities with the Home 0 realm of the <a href="../../../hut_online/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a>. Once Irena awakens, there will be a direct door between the two, in ruins that appear in both locations. There are large courtyards, in old stone complexes, where the recovered kavla seeds are dried.</p>
