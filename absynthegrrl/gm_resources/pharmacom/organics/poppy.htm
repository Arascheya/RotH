<p class="regtxt5">To harvest opium, the skin of the ripening pods is scored by a sharp blade. The slashes exude a white, milky latex, which dries to a sticky brown resin that is scraped off the pods as raw opium.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Raw opium must be processed and refined before it is suitable for smoking. The raw opium is first dissolved in water and simmered over a low heat. Mild acidification of the solution can aid in extraction of the alkaloids. The brown solution is now filtered to remove the insoluble vegetable waxes and then evaporated over a low heat. The result is a smokable form of opium with a considerably higher morphine content than the raw latex. This is then pressed into bricks and transported to either heroin laboratories or used as is.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Poppy tea has been used for thousands of years and is still used as a home remedy around the world today. It is occasionally used as part of a home method for 'detoxing' off of other opiate / heroin addictions. Poppy tea is used as a pain reliever, as a sleep aid, as a cough suppressant, as an intoxicant, and as a mild relaxant. The flavor of crude poppy teas is quite bitter and strong and many people find the taste completely unpalatable (nasty). Poppy tea can have effects varying from very light relaxation and sleepiness to overpowering sedation. Nausea is common.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Poppy Tea can only be made from either fresh or dried pods from the Opium Poppy (Papaver Somniferum). There are several "species" of poppy that contain the necessary alkaloids to make tea -- but almost all fall under the label of "Papaver Somniferum". Within the papaver somnfierum species there are several varieties that contain varying amounts of alkaloids, such as "Hens and Chickens", "Persian Whites" and many others. As long as you're sure you have somniferum pods, you're getting the "real deal", so to speak. Other species that contain the "good" alkaloids are Papaver Giganthemum and Papaver Paeoniflorum. Papaver Paeoniflorum is actually just a synonym for Papaver Somniferum, when it is grown decoratively. Papaver Giganthemums are also known as "Giants", due to the fact that their pods are around the size of a tennis ball.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Brewing up a batch of poppy tea is easy. Essentially all there is to it is grinding up some pods and adding them to boiled water. Presented below is a typical recipie for Poppy Tea. Make sure to always start with very few pods, and then work your way up to receive the desired effects. Remember -- it's better to start small and feel nothing, then to use too much and end up dead. Of course, this recipie is provided for informational purposes only, and it is not recommended that you actually try this.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Step one: Take your supply of poppy pods and grind them in a coffee grinder to create as fine a powder as possible. Mix the powder into a homogenous product, so as to account for variations in potency between one pod and the next.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Step two: Measure out five pods worth of powder. If you are using more "potent" strains such as hens and chickens, start with perhaps two. If you have a high tolerance to opiates, you can try more. But always remember to start SMALL. It's always better to waste some pods than to overdose!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Step three: Boil two cups of water on the stove. Once the water is boiling, remove from the heat and add your powdered pods. Do not boil the pods!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Step four: Stir occasionally, allowing around 10-15 minutes for the tea to "steep", and cool.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Step Five: Pour the contents through a strainer or cheesecloth into a mug. Save the used pulp from the strainer, as it can be used again, although at about half the strength. Only use one cup of water when doing a re-brew.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Step Six: Drink the mixture, including any powdery residue left at the bottom of your mug, as it will also contain alkaloids. Waste not want not!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Many people simply cannot stand the taste of the tea. It can be quite horrible in fact, especially if you can't handle bitter flavours well. Some people like to add some honey or sugar to their tea to mask the flavour. Others say that mixing the tea with Orange Juice can totally mask the flavour, without reducing the effects. In the end, it's up to you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Remember, as with any opiate based substance, it is possible to both overdose and become addicted to poppy tea. So use caution! It's always better not to start at all, but if you must, it is imperative that you treat these powerful substances with the respect that they deserve.</p>
