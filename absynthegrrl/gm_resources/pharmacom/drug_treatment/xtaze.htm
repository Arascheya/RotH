<p class="sectioncaption">Description</p>
<p class="regtxt5">clear twelve sided crystals</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Production</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Organic, derived from <a href="../organics/zerym.htm">Zerym</a> flowers and Black Lotus root</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The roots are waqshed and mashed together with the flowers. water and alcohol are added and the mix is left to steep for several days. The plant matter is strained out, rinsed with the purest alcohol available, and discarded. The liquid is slowly simmered until a super-saturated solution is reached. It is seeded either with a crystal of xtase or with black lotus pollen. The crystals are harvested and the remaining liquid is added back in to the next batch.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Effects</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Disolving one crystal in alcohol will give the user wild visions of the past, present, dreams, illusions, and nightmares. The nightmares begin to appear with habitual use rather than as an immediate effect. During this state the user is in an intense euphoric state, even during the nightmares. It disconnects the mind from the body so trivial things like hunger, thirst, and pain are not noticed. Xtaze is also extremely addictive. This is simulated with a CON or less roll each time the drug is used. Failure indicates addiction.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Withdrawl is extremely difficult. The only method that works is to confine the person where they can no longer get the drug and wait for the addictive reactions to fade. This can take anywhere from 4 weeks to 3 months depending on the user, time of addiction, and strength of will. Even clean the ex-user will randomly crave the drug. Should they take it again, addiction returns in full force. A second attempt at withdrawl often ends in the death of the user.</p>
