<p class="regtxt5">Additions to history section:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Excavation for the foundations of the original building cracked into the tunnel system surrounding a <a href="">Hell Gate</a>. This resulted in the death of several workmen before the tunnels were sealed with the foundation structure. There was a secret agreement between the primary contractor and the first museum director to embed an access method into the foundation. This information was lost until recently when a low level researcher found it while preparing for the museum birthday bash.</p>
