<p class="pagecaption">Galhai Waste</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Galhai Waste was formed by the battle between <a href="../npcs/teschmar.htm">Tesch Mar</a> and Nyigroth. The Hand recovered the Hand and Eye of Etesa after the battle and began his program to release the demons and Etesa from imprisonment after this acquisition. <a href="../npcs/thehand.htm">The Hand</a> lives in the Waste and is the Undying One refered to in the <a href="akhalt/akhalt.htm">Akhalt</a> legends. Integrate some of the Salt Sea and Al Qadim ruins into this area. Need to plant the Akhalt legend somewhere where the players can come across it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Galhai Wastes replace the Great Anvil in the Lotus Empire maps.</p>
