<p class="pagecaption">Cavern of Dark Delights - Descriptions</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This establishment is a series of linked caverns under the <a href="../lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>. It's exact location is not important since it is linked to several of the major cities through slaved <a href="../../gates_inx.htm">World Gate</a> portals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are many bricked over appearing doors in the common room. Each of these represents another place the Caverns connects to. When a player arrives, thet will be recognized by each door they have been through. Any door the player has used before will appear to be an actual portal, rather than a blank wall. Only players that have arrived through a particular door can leave through it. If they attempt to take anyone with them, the new person will see only a blank wall and be unable to pass through it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Cavern is a rowdy place with adventurers from various areas of the Empire flowing through. Anything in the nature of food and drink can likely be had here for the right price. Information and materials as well if you know who to ask.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a granite <a href="../../../c_fred2/sphinxweb.htm">sphynx</a> statue crouching near one of the bricked over doorways. Those with a ring key can go through the door to the <a href="../../info/tubetrains.htm#tt_nums">Tube Train Station</a> for the Cavern. Carved into the statue is: "Follow my brothers on the path to knowledge. Those possessing the Ring Keys of the Ancients may take the Egg to the <a href="../../cf2_inx.htm">Labyrinth of Understanding</a>. Seek my Red Marble brother at the number 201. (CoDDTT4100)" In the presence of a <a href="../../eritsani_inx.htm">T'Sani</a> there will be another line of red painted text saying: "Ok, this is totally insane. While there are some fun things in the Labyrinth, seven levels of this fun gets old very quickly. It is best to go directly to station number 208, the station nearest the master library entry. Just beware the death from above, the guardians and owners of the Seventh Hall, the Hive and its Queen."</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Notes:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In reality it is near the main <a href="../../info/tubetrains.htm">Tube Train</a> line between the <a href="../lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a> and the <A href="../val_exp/val_exp_inx.htm">Valley of Experiment</a> with its own terminal. The default door available to anyone arriving by <a href="../../info/tubetrains.htm">Tube Train</a> is the <a href="../lotus_empire/jakara.htm">Jakara</a> door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One or two items could have the <a href="../../info/umbreylla.htm">Um Brey Lla</a> logo on them. This would be more exotic seasonings or other food service related items.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">new cuisine for Empire - consider a few of these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_cuisine">asian</a> items, also look for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern_Cuisine">middle eastern cuisines</a> to add to the mix - the Cavern is a popular eating place, considered to serve some of the more interesting varieties of <a href="../lotus_empire/lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a> cuisine</p>
