<p class="pagecaption">Amorama Castle</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This impressive castle sits atop a hill of broken rock a few miles south of II Aluk. The massive structure appears even more solid than the bedrock below it. The natives of Darkon believe this castle is a gateway to a dark abyss, and in a sense, they are right. The castle's name (pronounced Ah-VARE-nus) stems from a peculiar  phenomenon. There are only a few species of birds (one called avis in the old tongue) willing to fly over the fortress. Only vultures, crows, and the like can be found circling the sullen stone walls. Other species die mysteriously as soon as their shadows fall upon its spires.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Azalin's castle is considered to be a sinkhole of evil, which adds a -2 penalty to any attempt to turn undead within its walls. Certain rooms and areas are worse, and may force stiffer penalties. The Room of Life (room 70) does not act as a sinkhole of evil unless Azalin himself is present. It is well known in Darkon that Azalin is a powerful wizard. The sight of his doom guards on the walls is chilling, but not surprising to the common folk of the area. The archlich generally keeps his more grotesque undead slaves out of casual view.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">High up in the castle (room 68) a groaning spirit haunts a lonely tower. Her moans of pain can be heard in the courtyards and on the walls. Inside the main castle, the sounds are too muted to be heard. However, her elven blood calls to any true elves. They can hear her moans and cries from anywhere in the castle except the underground dungeon levels. There  is no ill effect to hearing the banshee's wails from a distance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the characters regain their heads, it is shortly after nightfall. A full moon hangs in the sky as they traverse the dark corridors of Castle Avernus. The moonlight dimly illuminates any room that has a few arrow slits. Otherwise, the PCs will need torches or some other form of light in order to see their surroundings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Halls of Humanity: On those few occasions when Azalin has living guests, they are restricted to the Halls of Humanity. This is the name of the east wing of the castle, also called the Block. Guests have the run of that wing, but may not venture out of it at risk of pain of death. At the time of this adventure, there are no guests in the castle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Construction:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Most of the windows are actually arrow slits. These narrow openings allow anyone to look outside. However, they are only six inches wide, too narrow to be climbed through. The distance between all floors is 15 feet. The height from floor to ceiling is around 12 feet, allowing 3 feet for supports.  The bulk of the castle is stone. The stones are large and tightly fitted. Although there is no mortar, the fit is tight enough to not even allow air to pass.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">General Features</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Walls and Towers: Doom guards patrol the walls and interiors of the watch towers.  There is a 1 in 6 chance of  encountering a doom guard for each full turn (10 rounds) the PCs spend in the gate towers or on the walls. The doom guards attack anyone in the towers. Since they cannot talk, they cannot raise an alarm. However, Axrock knows immediately if one of his creations is destroyed. The dwarven vampire will not seek vengeance himself, but tells Azalin that it happened.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Doom Guards (63): Int Low; AC 2; MV 9; HD 5; hp 30 each; THACO 15; PAT 1; Dmg 148; SD cannot be turned, immune to mind affecting spells, immune to biological effects; SZ M; ML 20; XP 2,000; AL N.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rooms of Magic: There are 10 rooms of magic in the castle, one for each school of wizardry. Azalin built them to augment his magical abilities, hoping that they would permit him to learn new spells in those schools. They did indeed augment his power, but did not allow him to learn new spells. Within each room, spells of that school are cast as if the caster were two levels higher.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Room Descriptions</p>

<p class="regtxt5">1.  Storeroom:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This large room is lined with shelves. Any spell component imaginable can be found here. Everything is clearly labeled. Two large, locked trunks sit back to back in the center of the room. Inside them are the characters' spellbooks and other items that might have been stored in back packs or bags.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">On one of the shelves is a large green bottle labeled "sanguine solution." Inside is a dark red paste. If it is smeared on a character's neck, his head can be positioned properly and it will be reattached. If the head is positioned crooked, it is forever reattached in that position! If the characters expressly state that they are taking care to place their heads on straight, they do so successfully. If they simply state that they "put the head back on," then there is a 5% chance of it being crooked. Such an error does not affect combat abilities in any way, but does make a character look somewhat deformed. Such a character suffers a permanent 1-point reduction to Charisma unless the defect is somehow corrected (limited wish or similar magic.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">2. Azalin's Wizard Lab:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This large room is divided into several sections and is filled with shelves and long tables. Only one chair can be found in the entire room, and it has heavy leather straps on the arms and legs. The shelves contain books, spell components, liquids of varying colors, strange sculptures, stuffed animals, jars of live insects, worms, lizards, reams of blank parchment, glassware of all shapes and sizes, and so on.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">All of the texts are obscure reference sources for various magics. Most of them are unreadable by Azalin due to his curse. He keeps 'them around, hoping to one day be freed of his curse. An open book lies on the table where Azalin put the characters' heads in jars. A quick perusal of it reveals the exact ointment needed for the characters to reattach their heads. They cannot find this ointment in the lab, only in the storeroom.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">There are a few magical items of value here -- in particular, two potions of healing and a deep red ioun stone (+ 1 to Dexterity).</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The lab has recently been infested by osquips. These six-legged, ratlike monsters have chewed a tunnel through the stone floor. The entrance to the tunnel is underneath a large table, behind some small barrels. By the time the characters are free to move around, the naga will have killed all the osquips.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The tunnel itself is just wide enough fear a human to squeeze through. It leads into the bone room (room 3). The tunnel should be described as tight and claustrophobic. This is the only way out of the wizard's lab. Azalin uses only teleport spells to get in and out.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Spirit Raga (1): Int High; AC 4; MV 12; HD 10; hp 50; THACO 11; # AT 1; Dmg 1d3; SA charm gaze, poison bite, spells; SZ H (15' long); ML 14; XP 5,000; AL CE.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Wizard Spells: magic missile, phantasmal force, charm person, wall of fog; invisibility, mirror image; protection from normal missiles.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Priest Spells: darkness, protection from good, curse; hold person, silence 15' radius.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The naga has ignored the PCs until now, but prepares for an upcoming fight. She knows that the characters will attack her or she'll be forced to attack them eventually. She hides in the osquip tunnel while they free their bodies from the Zharakim. She casts protection from normal missiles, protection from good, and invisibility as they make their way toward the storeroom, or if they begin to hunt for her. Once invisible, she seeks out a character and surprises him with a bite. She then tries to make eye contact with a PC to charm him. Beyond that, her strategy will be dictated by the events.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">3. Bone Room:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The floor of this room is buried in thousands of bones -- the bones of animals, humans, demihumans and monsters. From this assortment, Azalin can summon virtually any skeletal form he desires. The only other feature of this room is the four massive stone pillars that form the foundation of the castle.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The osquip tunnel opens into the rib cage of a giant. 1t is fairly simple to crawl out of the skeleton. However, the first character out has a small problem. The rib cage snaps shut, like a bear trap, imprisoning that character behind bars of bone. The giant skeleton guardian then stands up and attacks the other characters as they crawl out of the tunnel. The giant skeleton wields an enormous single headed axe made of bones. The edge is wickedly sharp. Attacking the skeleton risks hurting the character trapped on the inside. Any miss with a slashing or piercing weapon has a 50% chance of hitting the trapped PC. Any hit with a slashing or piercing weapon causes half damage to the skeleton (per the rules) and the other half to the PC. Blunt weapons cause normal damage without affecting the trapped character.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">If the characters specifically state that they are aiming for the legs, arms, or head, they have a -4 chance to hit, but will not hurt their trapped companion. The trapped character does not have enough room to wield a weapon, but can cast spells or use magical items. Monster skeletons are 6 HD creatures and are turned as wraiths. Azalin's castle is considered to be a sinkhole of evil, which places a -- 2 penalty on any attempt to turn undead. If the skeleton is turned, it flees with the captured PC still inside.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Giant Skeleton (1): Int Non; AC 6; MV 12; HD 6; hp 30; THACO 15; PAT 1; Dmg 1d10; SD immune to fear, charm, hold; SZ H (12'); ML 14; XP 650; AL N.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">4. Lower Dungeon:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This is where Azalin keeps his most valuable and dangerous prisoners. Most of the cells are empty. The walls of this dungeon are lined with lead, to prevent teleporting and other magical means of escape. The cells along the east wall have solid iron doors. Those in the center and the four larger cells have heavy, iron-barred gates. All of the cells containing prisoners are wizard locked, as is the door that connects the two hallways and the one that connects the outer room to the first hallway. The door that connects to the bone room (03) is not locked or wizard locked. It is fully 12 inches thick, made of oak and banded in iron. It cannot be smashed open even by a giant.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The large outer room is home to the bone golem (alternate: flesh golem) warden of the dungeon. It attacks anything that tries to enter or leave the dungeon. It will enter the dungeon corridors if necessary, but will not enter the bone room.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Bone Golem: Int Non; AC 0; MV 12; HD 14; hp 70; THACO 7; # AT 1; Dmg 3d6; SA hideous laugh; SD + 2 weapon to hit, half damage from piercing or edged weapons, immune to most spells; SZ M; ML 20; XP 18,000; AL N.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The following creatures of power are imprisoned in the dungeon (one each): draw, werefox, mind flayer, wolfwere, werebear, red widow*, wereraven*. The creatures followed by an asterisk (*) are from the RAVENLOFT Monstrous Compendium and should be substituted with other creatures if the DM does not have a copy.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In addition to the creatures of power, a group of three elves is held prisoner, as well as a lone vistas named Hyskosa. His actions are described earlier. The Dungeon Master should arbitrarily decide which creatures occupy which cells. The elves are neutral good 6th-level rangers. They do not have arms or equipment. They will gladly join the party if asked, as will the good-aligned creatures (werebear and wereraven). In any future fights, traps, or other dangerous situations, these brave souls are the first to be attacked (in effect, cannon fodder). If they die in particularly horrifying ways, horror checks are called for from each of the PCs.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">No experience points are awarded for killing a creature trapped in its cell. Killing the elves or any other creature without good reason is cause for a Ravenloft powers check. Knowing that a creature is an evil monster is reason enough, but all of these creatures, except the draw and the mind flayer, will appear to be human at first.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Elven Rangers (Relas, Vergo, & Mauran): Int Very; AC 9; MV 12; HD 6; hp 27, 23, 19 (11, 15, 5 when found wounded); THACO 17 (16 w/bow or sword); # AT 1 or 2; Dmg by weapon; SD move silently 57%, hide in shadows 42%, infravision 60', find secret doors; SZ M; ML 16; AL NG.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">5. Treasure Chamber:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Azalin keeps his money here, along with a few important magical items. Although the door to the room is wizard locked, it has no other guardians or traps. The lich places little value on money. The mere fact that it is in the lowest level of his dungeon is protection enough.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">There are dozens of chests in this room. Each is filled to the top with small bags of coins, 100 per bag. Each chest is devoted to a single type of coin. Each is minted with the face of Azalin (his human face). There are no gems here. Azalin keeps those in another part of the castle. The characters can take as much as they can carry. If they do so, all encumbrance rules apply. Carrying all that treasure will certainly slow them considerably.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The coins in this room carry a mild curse. A detect magic spell will reveal nothing. If they are removed from the castle without Azalin's permission, the face on the coin changes to  become his undead face. Shopkeepers in Darkon will refuse the coins, but it is possible to "launder" them. It will take several days to find a moneychanger who will accept the transaction, and the exchange rate is one real coin for four of the cursed coins. Shopkeepers and merchants outside of Darkon, including anyone in other realms (Toril, Oerth, Krynn, etc.) will accept the coins, but must make the equivalent of a fear check if handed one.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Hidden in a false bottom of one of the chests is a clerical scroll with three spells (remove fear, restoration, resurrection) and a cloak of protection +3.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">6.  Unused Room:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This room is empty.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">7. Arcane Torture Chamber:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This room is specifically designed to torture or

extract information from powerful creatures that might have magical powers.

The walls of this room are lined with lead, and the mortar in the stone is

mixed with basilisk blood to prevent teleporting or other magical escapes. The

door has a wizard lock cast on it by Azalin.

Scattered around the room are many common torture devices, as well as a few

stranger devices. Most of them are magical and can be detected as such. In the

center of the room is a copper brazier with a fire in it. No wood, oil, or

other obvious fuel is apparent. The flames are actually a small fire elemental

magically trapped in the brazier.

Half a dozen magical daggers (+ 1 enchantment) are mounted on a rack. Chains

and manacles are all enchanted to adjust to the size of their victim, and are

unbreakable.



8. Tower Stairs: These circular stairs rise from the depths of Avernus to one

of its highest spires, but only a few floors at a time. The first flight of

stairs ends on the ground floor and exits into room 13.



 9. Antechamber: This room is empty. Only a few cobwebs grace the cold, stone

walls.



10. Upper Dungeon: This is where Azalin keeps ordinary prisoners. Most of the

people here are normal humans or demihumans. They have committed political

errors or personal crimes against Azalin. The archlich really doesn't care

about common criminals -- only those who have wronged him personally. All are

sentenced to death, some more slowly than others. About 75% of these cells are

full, which brings the prison population to roughly 30.

Half the prisoners have been driven mad. All are at 25% of their normal hit

points. If the PCs free them, they will die before they can escape from the

castle unless personally guarded by the characters. Azalin's doom guards and

zombies will slay them mercilessly. If the PCs try to take them along, the DM

should see to it that the prisoners die in horrifying ways on a regular basis.

They set off every trap, fail all horror checks, and basically serve as cannon

fodder.

Two prisoners in this group are noteworthy. Both are 4th-level thieves and are

twins, a brother and a sister. They have 50% of their hit points and will

gladly join the party if asked. for the duration of this adventure, they will

deal with the PCs honestly and not attempt to pilfer anything. However, they

could die during combat or when a trap is set off.

The guards are all ju-ju zombies. They are smart enough to know that the PCs

don't belong here and will attack them. Two are always patrolling the

corridors among the cells. The remaining four are in the large outer room,

awaiting orders.



Human Thieves (Geoff & Janeth): Int Avg; AC 9; MV 12; HD 4; hp 15, 12 (8, 7

blunt or piercing weapons or fire, immune to illusions, mind affecting spells,

electricity, magic missiles, turn as 8 HD monsters; SZ M; ML special; AL N

(E).



11. Zombie Barracks: This is home to Azalin's zombie army, which numbers more

than 500 zombies. While he can call upon the dead of Darkon regardless of

where they are buried, the archlich has found it useful to have an army

present at his castle. None of these bodies will move or respond to the

characters in any way. They are simply corpses until Azalin animates them.

Viewing this room is cause for a horror check.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

The rotting stench of decayed, human flesh surrounds you. The echoes of your

hushed voices tell you that this room is enormous, stretching far beyond your

meager light source. In the flickering torch light, you see mounds of dead

bodies. Each appears to be a soldier now long dead, for each wears scraps of

rusted armor, and their clawed hands still grip rusty blades.  END



12. Outer Bailey: This open courtyard lies between the front gate and the

immense main -- keep.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

The flagstone courtyard is barren, devoid of even the smallest weed. Scant

moonlight casts murky shadows in the corners. The narrow double doors of what

is obviously a main gate are five times the height of a man and wide enough

for two horses. Twin stairs hug the inner walls, climbing secretively upward

to meet the imposing guard towers that flank the gate.

The stone wall to the left of the gate is low, barely higher than the top of

the gate itself.  A slow-moving, armored figure glides from battlement to

battlement. The wall to the right of the gate is nearly double the height of

the gate. Both are dwarfed by the immense round keep opposite the gate, rising

into the starlit night like a man-made mountain of solid stone.

A far-away moan of agony reaches your ears. It echoes off the walls and is

finally absorbed by the cloudless night sky. As the moan dies away, you hear a

faint shriek of pain and agony.  END



No one will notice the characters while they are in the bailey. The doom

guards that walk the walls can see them, but ignore them. If the characters

make for the gate or otherwise attempt to leave the castle without Azalin's

phylactery, two things happen. First, Hyskosa or his phantom spirit appears

and appeals to the characters. As stated earlier, he warns them that the only

way they can escape with their lives is to secure the phylactery. If they

ignore this warning and try to leave, they have outlived their usefulness to

Azalin. He will immediately attack, attempting to kill them or drive them back

into the castle. If they will not carry his phylactery, he will find others to

do it.



13. Gallery: This double room spans two floors. A balcony rings the outer

walls. The northeast pillar supports a set of stairs that allows access to the

balcony. The southwest pillar is encircled by stairs that climb through a hole

in the ceiling, two floors up. The doors to both baileys (rooms 12 and 16) are

built to withstand siege equipment. The PCs cannot break them down and they

are locked. Azalin doesn't want the characters to leave without his

phylactery.

Azalin has hung many portraits here. They decorate the walls on both levels.

Each is larger than life and depicts one of the domain lords of Ravenloft. The

lords are shown in their most human-looking appearances (if applicable). No

names are shown, for Azalin knows each of  them. He uses any means available,

magical or mundane, to get such portraits painted. Some are stolen from the

domain lords' estates at great risk.

Many of the portraits were painted by a vampire slave who was an artist before

Azalin corrupted his talents. The vampire traveled to each domain personally

to see each lord before beginning his work.

If the characters reach this room and have not yet encountered Hyskosa, they

meet him here. As stated earlier, the vistana seer wills himself to die when

he feels the PCs choose a future that does not lead them to his prison cell.

His spirit meets them in this room.

Give the PCs a minute or two to look around the gallery before starting this

encounter. For details, see the earlier section on Hyskosa.

High up in the castle (room 68), a groaning spirit haunts a lonely tower. Her

moans of pain can be heard in the courtyards and on the battlements. Inside

the main castle, the sounds are too muted to be heard. However, her elven

blood calls to any true elves in the party. They can hear her moans and cries

the moment they enter this room, and throughout the rest of the castle. There

is no ill effect for hearing her cries at this distance.



14. Foyer: This room is furnished with sofas, chairs, and a mirror.



15. Hall of Records: It is said that every person who enters Darkon loses his

memory of his former life after a few months (see the RAVENLOFT~ boxed set

entry for Darkon). The reason can be found on the second floor of the Hall of

Records.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

Before you is a gigantic glowing book, taller than a man and twice as wide. It

floats upright a few inches over the stone floor. In front of the book is a

large table, filled with books of normal size. One is open and a multicolored

quill inscribes in it, although no hand or creature directs it.  END



Closer examination reveals that the large book, called the Book of Names, is

filled with names and dates. The books on the tables are all blank. The

bobbing quill seems to be writing a journal, describing events in the life of

an unknown traveler.

Both the Book of Names and the pen are  indestructible with the means the

characters have at hand. The pen can be stopped merely by taking hold of it.

However, it will automatically return to the table (floating, teleporting, or

whatever is necessary) if removed from this room.

Azalin found the Book of Names in his castle  when Darkon was first created.

It was inscribing his own name as the first entry. If the characters flip

through the Book of Names to see the first entry, it reads: Firan Zal'honan,

the Azal'Lan of Knurl, 429 CY. Azal'Lan means "wizard ruler" in Old Oeridian.

Over time, the archlich discovered that a few months after someone entered

Darkon, the pen began inscribing his life story into one of the blank books.

As events were written, the person lost his memory of them. When the pen was

finished, it would write the name of the person in the Book of Names, along

with the date. As soon as the person's name was entered into the huge tome, he

lost all memory of his previous existence and gained false memories of a life

and family in Darkon.

The shelves in the Hall of Records are filled with these biographies. The name

of each person is penned on the spine. The pages are filled with a diary

account of their lives up until they were entered into the Book of Names.

There is no order or organization to the books -- they aren't even stacked

neatly on the shelves.

The archlich has some control over the Book of Names. With arcane command

words, he can find any requested name. A glowing streamer seeks out the

matching volume on the shelves. He can then study that person's life prior to

integration into Darkon.

There are only a few ways for a person to retrieve his memories. If the book

of a person's  life is burned in a magical fire, his memory  returns and his

name is erased from the huge book. If dust of disappearance is sprinkled over

a person's name, he also regains his memory. However, his life story remains

on the shelves. Both of these methods are only temporary. In one to three

months, the floating quill will once again begin to inscribe the person's life

into a  blank book.

If a quill of law is used to draw a line through a name in the large book, the

person gets his memory back. The story of his life remains on the shelves and

Azalin can still locate it. However, his name can never again be written in

Azalin's giant book.

A ghostly librarian named Elzarath is in service here (see the RAVENLOFT~

boxed set). He appears to be an elderly man whose head was severed. His head

can move independently of his body. The head floats through the Hall of

Records and the library. Elzarath can carry and move small objects (like

books). He cannot attack or be harmed by the PCs. Using Van Richten's system

of classification, Elzarath is a first-magnitude, semicorporeal humanoid

spirit.

When a book is completed, Elzarath finds a place for it on the shelves. When

the supply of blank books dwindles, he brings more books and places them on

the table.

Seeing the phantom librarian is cause for a horror check, due mainly to the

personal decapitation experience the PCs have suffered. Elzarath will speak

only if spoken to. His disembodied head does the talking while his body

continues to work. He will openly speak about the book and how it works, if

asked. Elzarath does not know about the three ways to erase a name, although

he does know that a name can be erased. He has no knowledge of the castle

outside the Hall of Records and the library.

Given a name, Elzarath can find any book in 2d4 rounds. However, since

Azalin's book is not labeled "Azalin," Elzarath can find it only if the birth

name of the archlich is given. Elzarath has never flipped back through the

Book of Names and does not know Azalin's birth name. If the characters obtain

Azalin's  book, give them a photocopy of the handout at the back of this

adventure.



16. Inner Bailey: This rear courtyard is empty. No one will take any notice of

the characters while they are in the bailey. The doom guards that walk the

walls can see the PCs, but ignore them. If the characters make for the gate or

attempt to leave the castle without Azalin's phylactery, two things happen.

First, Hyskosa or his phantom spirit appears and appeals to the characters. As

stated earlier, he warns them that the only way they can escape with their

lives is to secure the phylactery.

Azalin will be watching the party carefully from the balcony (top floor of

room 31). If they ignore Hyskosa's warning and try to leave, they have

outlived their usefulness. He immediately attacks, attempting to kill the PCs

or drive them back into the castle. If they will not carry his phylactery,

Azalin will find others who can do it.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

This small courtyard is enclosed by looming walls. Moonlight glints off the

armored shapes slowly walking the battlements. Behind you, the immense round

towers of the keep rise up toward the stars. Looking up, you can see a

crenelated walkway high overhead. A stairway winds up and out of sight. Just

below the walkway is a small, dark balcony protruding from the smooth stone.

Higher up, on the face of the tower, is a large, mysterious hole, fully as

wide as four men's outstretched arms.

Black smoke rises from the squat chimney of a small, wooden building in the

far corner of the courtyard, The rhythmic ringing of what sounds like hammer

and anvil can clearly be heard in the still night air. An open doorway emits a

dull, red glow.

Between the ringing tones of the smithy, far-away groans and cries of agony

can be heard. They seem to waft down from the highest castle towers.  END



17. Smithy: Inside this building, a dwarven vampire (alternate: standard

vampire who happens to be a dwarf) named Axrock works steadily on an anvil of

darkness, creating another doom guard for Azalin. He looks like a normal dwarf

when the PCs meet him.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

The stout body of the dwarven smith is outlined by the red glow of his

furnace. His thickly muscled arms steadily hammer a piece of steel resting on

his anvil. Behind him is a partially completed suit of armor. He speaks

without looking up or ceasing his labors. "What's yer need?"  END



Axrock's duty is to create doom guards -- suits of animated armor (see the

RAVENLOFT Monstrous Compendium). He will most likely have heard the PCs

coming; as a vampire, his hearing is supernaturally sharp. He has no interest

in starting a fight, since that would interrupt his work. He can talk while

hammering away on the armor, but only if visitors are respectful of his work.

Axrock knows that doom guards, zombies, and skeletons are the principal guards

of the castle. He knows that Azalin's quarters are in the highest spires of

the castle. He does not know where the phylactery is hidden. If the PCs try to

recruit him, since it is not obvious that he is a vampire, Axrock declines,

saying with typical dwarven fervor that he must first finish his work.

If Axrock is forced to fight and is reduced to 10 hp or less, he shrieks in

agony and uses his stonewalking ability to sink into the earth. His intent is

to make the PCs think he has been destroyed. He vows to make them pay for

disrupting his work. While underground, he waits until he has regenerated all

his hit points (7-10 rounds). He then pops up with a battle axe' and attacks

the characters again. Axrock harasses the PCs until one side is dead.

Skeever may use a suggestion spell to try to force one of the characters to

rush forward and knock down the dwarf. Since this would interrupt his work and

possibly ruin the doom guard, Axrock will be upset. The characters have one

round to calm him before he attacks. The DM must judge whether the characters

adequately soothe the dwarf's rage.

hp/round if underground; SZ S (4'); ML 14; XP 3,000; AL NE.



18. Warehouse: Azalin has little need for the stored goods common to a normal

castle. His unliving servitors don't need food or other supplies. What few

supplies he needs are stored in this warehouse. There are some foodstuffs and

barrels of water for those occasions when living guests are present. There are

raw materials and tools for making repairs to almost anything. There is also a

small cache of weapons and armor. Packed away in chests are at least one of

every type of nonmagical weapon and armor conceivable.



19. Servitor's Quarters: Castle Avernus has little need for traditional

servitors. Its large undead staff performs most menial tasks. The powerful

magic of its lord handles the rest. The servants that stay here are primarily

responsible for the comfort and well-being of the few living guests Azalin

might decide to entertain.

Axrock (the dwarven vampire from room 17) has one room. It contains a stone

vault the size of a coffin, where he "sleeps" during the day. Various stone

and metal objects of beauty are here as well. The other servants are not aware

that he is a vampire.

The other four rooms are home to a family of unusual ghosts. Azalin has bound

them in service to himself and the castle. They are not ghosts as defined in

the Monstrous Compendium. To use Dr. Van Richten's classification, they are

first-magnitude,  semicorporeal, humanoid spirits. Their origins are rooted in

dedication to their tasks and to each other. In terms of alignment, they are

lawful neutral.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

In any other castle, this scene would be familiar and even comfortable. The

room is obviously a washroom. A middle-aged woman scrubs clothes in a tub.

Another woman, ancient as the moon, sits in a chair, mending a nameless piece

of cloth. A man is bent over a small table tinkering with a lantern. Two small

children play quietly at their feet. All glance up at you, smile, and continue

their work. Somehow, seeing such a normal family doing ordinary work is

somewhat chilling.  END



Cranbell and Ariane Tallow are the parents. The two small children are Thomas

and Frinella. Half a dozen aunts and uncles are present, as well as one

matriarchal grandmother named Irabell. They look and act like normal people.

They can move objects with their hands just like normal people. They are

immune to physical damage, but not magical damage or magical weapons. They can

walk through walls, but cannot fly or float.

If the characters spend any significant length of time with the Tallow family,

they might see one of the children walk through a wall. The Tallows are

allowed to go anywhere in the castle. However, fear of Azalin prevents them

from helping the PCs much. Within the Halls of Humanity (all floors) and the

ground floor of the castle, they are very friendly and helpful. Beyond those

areas, they dare not help. In general, they have sad, melancholy

personalities. It's hardly a picnic being a weak ghost in the enforced service

of an evil archlich.

The specific functions of these four rooms are kitchen, laundry, mending room,

living quarters. Activities such as making soap or candles are done outdoors

(at night, of course) in the inner bailey (room 16). Technically, the living

quarters are haunted because the Tallows are ghosts. The Tallow family works

here. They keep up the pretense of normal living in these rooms, despite their

undead nature.



20. Banquet Hall: Azalin's castle has a banquet hall purely for appearances.

On rare occasions, he might use it to entertain living guests. At this time,

it is a well-decorated room dominated by a long table. Intricately carved

chairs surround it. The chair at the north end of the table is grander than

the rest, since it is Azalin's. Dust and cobwebs cover everything.



21. Waiting Room: Anyone seeking an audience with Azalin waits here. The

archlich is widely thought to be an immortal sorcerer king, not a horror from

beyond the grave. Occasionally, he receives petitioners in his role as ruler

of Darkon. Elegant divans and chairs are here for dignitaries to rest in. An

ornate set of double doors leads to the throne room. A wide, curving stair

leads up to the next floor.

Two doom guards are here, one to either side of the door. As soon as the

characters enter the room, they snap to attention with a metallic rattle. They

do not attack the party unless attacked first. If the characters approach

within five feet of the throne room doors, the doom guards turn and open the

ponderous doors.



22. Throne Room: Azalin uses this room to receive guests who have been granted

audience with "King Azalin" of Darkon.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

An enormous room opens before you, stretching well over a hundred feet to the

other end. The ceiling is higher than all but the tallest trees. The walls and

ceiling are layered in hammered gold, finely filigreed and delicately painted.

Rich silk tapestries hang from the walls. The far end of the room appears to

be one huge, red velvet curtain.

Centered against the backdrop of the curtain is a monolithic throne. The chair

itself sits atop a raised, stepped stage as tall as a man. The throne itself

is sized to seat a  giant, not a man. It is worked in silver and inlaid with

rubies and sapphires.

Seated on this throne is the moldering body of a giant, fully twice the size

of a normal man. Torn flesh hangs bloodless from its limbs and torso. A crude

iron crown, set with a single yellow gem, rests on its head. A blood-red cape,

trimmed in black, hangs from its shoulders. It raises one hand to point at

you, and a cruel, booming laugh rolls through the room.  END



A permanent illusion makes the room appear to be richly decorated. The curtain

against the back wall can be parted directly behind the throne, although the

split is not visible, even up close. The same illusion makes the room appear

twice as large as its actual size. All the dimensions in the description above

have been doubled. It is no coincidence that anyone seated upon the throne

also appears to be twice normal size. This room actually spans two floors,

giving it a real ceiling height of just over 25 feet.

Anyone seated on the throne can see the room for what it really is. The room

is cold, barren, and significantly smaller than it first appears. The ceiling

sports large spider webs filled with tiny glowing eyes and scuttling bodies

(none will attack). The throne is made of a giant's skull and pieces of his

skeleton. The red velvet curtain is moldy and patched.

The giant figure is a normal zombie. However, he is impressive enough that

each character must make a fear check upon seeing him. Azalin is toying with

the characters, making them think that a giant-sized version of himself waits

for them here. If one of the characters specifically asks (and only if someone

asks) whether this thing looks like Azalin, the PC should be told it does not.

If the PCs don't immediately attack, the zombie rises and slowly walks toward

them, laughing crazily the whole time. If it is turned (highly likely), it

flees through the curtain and tries to get to the hallway (room 23).



23. Hidden Hallway: This hallway is a hidden access to the throne room. The

door connecting it to the gallery is quite visible and not a secret, but it is

locked. The door to the hidden area behind the curtain is never locked. It has

special hinges that allow it to open with complete silence. Azalin, or others,

can enter or leave the throne room through the hidden hallway without being

seen by those in the waiting room.

There is a secret door in this hallway. It opens into a narrow tunnel that

bores right through the stone bulwark of the central keep wall. This tunnel is

only 3 feet wide and 7 feet tall. A normal man can walk through it, but an

armored man must turn sideways.



24. Tower Room: This is the second section of the hanging tower. Its

staircases run from the second floor to the sixth floor, 75 feet up. The

topmost floor is a dead end.



25. Gate Towers: These towers are strictly for defensive purposes. Since

Castle Avernus will almost certainly never fall under siege, these towers are

simply for show. The bases of the towers are solid stone. In a normal castle,

the rooms on this level would hold war supplies, such as weapons, pitch to be

boiled, etc. In this case, the rooms are empty. Curving staircases allow

access to the next level. A doom guard patrols here. Its circuit starts in one

of these rooms. It then goes up into room 26, over to the other tower, and

down again.



26. Gate Towers: This level is much the same as the one below it (room 25). A

hallway connects the two tower rooms, with several arrow slits facing both in

and out. In the center of this corridor is a metal plate on the floor. It

reveals a murder hole that looks down on the main gate, used to fire arrows or

drop things down upon attackers. A doom guard patrols here. Its circuit starts

in room 25. If walks up into this room, over to the other tower, and down

again.



27. West Bailey Outer Wall: This short wall is patrolled by a doom guard. Only

the door to the main keep is locked.



28.  Landing: The grand stair ends on this level. A narrower stair leads up to

the next level. The walls are tastefully decorated and the floor is carpeted.





29. Inner Bailey Wall: This hallway leads to a tunnel that cuts through the

inner bailey wall. The tunnel is 5 feet wide, with densely packed arrow slits.

Behind each arrow slit is a round, wooden lid on the floor. If lifted, it

reveals a small murder hole that just barely overhangs the wall. This area is

patrolled by a pair of skeletons at all times. Since they are so easily turned

or destroyed, their combat abilities are not provided.



30. Room of Enchantment: One of the 10 rooms of magic, all enchantment/charm

spells cast here take effect as if the caster were two levels higher. All

saving throws vs. such spells are made at a -2 penalty here.

A long shelf against the south wall holds all the spell components necessary

to cast any enchantment spell. Any creature that enters this room is subject

to an emotion spell, attempting to cause fear. Since undead are immune to this

spell, it has no effect on the majority of the castle's inhabitants.



31. Room of Conjuration: One of the 10 rooms of magic, all

conjuration/summoning spells cast in this room take effect as if the caster

were 2 levels higher. Any casting on the staircase or while flying or

levitating is considered to be within the room. All saving throws vs. these

spells are made at a -2 penalty.

A long shelf against the west wall holds all the spell components necessary to

cast any conjuration spell. This is where Azalin performs some of his most

potent magic, for wish spells are of the conjuration school. If the characters

are not carrying a light source that extends at least 60 feet, do not read the

balcony description in brackets.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

The room is immense -- a huge cylinder rising into impenetrable shadows high

above. One wall is flat, cutting off the cylinder. A massive pillar thrusts

skyward in the center of the circle only a few steps from the flat wall. The

pillar is so thick it would take a dozen men linking hands to encircle it. A

spiral stair wraps around the pillar, interrupted only to join a walkway to a

balcony on the flat wall, high overhead. A wide circle is engraved in the

floor and covered with strange runes. The pillar is inside its are, but closer

to the edge than the center.

The curving wall of the room is dotted with dozens of small doors. Age-worn

lettering is stamped into each one, unreadable at this distance. The doors of

the lowest row are twice the height of a man. [At the edge of your light, high

overhead, a small balcony overlooks this mammoth room.]  END



The room is indeed immense, spanning five levels of the tower. The ceiling is

75 feet above the floor, beyond the range of a continual light spell, let

alone torches. The pillar is 20 feet wide and rises almost the entire distance

of the room, stopping short of the ceiling by 15 feet, apparently ending in

midair. This is apparent only after the PCs have climbed 10 or 15 feet up the

stairs (or they have a light source that reaches 75 feet).

The characters are actually looking up through the invisible floor of the room

above this one (room 55). The spiral stairs wind around the pillar and form

the only entrance to the level above.

Any attempt to fly up to the top of the pillar or to the small landing area

between the doors (see room 55 description) results in the character slamming

into the invisible ceiling. There is very little chance that the character

will safely pass through one of the entry holes.  The PC suffers 3d6 points of

damage from the collision and must make a save vs. breath weapon or be knocked

unconscious. An unconscious character will then fall 60 feet and suffer 6d6

points of damage upon landing.

A large, powerful magic circle has been permanently carved into the floor,

encircling the pillar. Two levels above the floor, a catwalk leads to a wide

balcony on one side. Near the top of the room is a small balcony. Behind it,

out of sight until a PC is halfway up the stairs, is a door.

On all levels but the first, the curved portion of the tower wall is filled

with doors. No ledge or stairs provides access to them. Behind each door is a

small room that is the tomb of a wraith or spectre. The name, birth date, and

death date of the person are inscribed on the door. One of the doors on the

topmost level is inscribed with a symbol of fear. Behind this door is a short

hall leading to the Room of Invocation (room 50).

The undead will attack any living creature that ascends the stair or attempts

to fly or levitate past that point. They will wait for their attacks until the

party is about halfway up (even with the balcony level). The wraiths and

spectres have free reign to roam anywhere in the castle, but tend to stay in

this room and the necromancy room, They will swarm any isolated character,

such as a PC who is flying or levitating.

Even here in Castle Avernus, the wraiths will be relatively easy to turn by a

9th-12th level cleric. A single continual light spell will drive them all away

instantly. The spectres will be tougher. Any turned undead flee the tower

through the balcony at the top that leads outside.

The biggest problem the characters face is Skeever the imp. He will attempt to

cast darkness 15' radius from the balcony onto the characters when they are

halfway up the stairs. The sudden darkness will allow the wraiths to swarm the

PCs.

32. Empty Room: The walls of this room are cold, bare stone.



33. Incantation Room: Just off the library, this room is designed for minor

incantations and petty magics. A magic circle has been etched into the stone

floor. Vile stains are burned into the stone itself. A table in the corner is

empty. Azalin uses it to hold books, usually from the library, and spell

components while he is using this room.



 34. Library: This modest library holds a collection of histories of the

various domains, including Darkon. For example, a copy of the Tome of Strahd

exists here. Since the domains of Ravenloft have been in existence for only a

short time, historically speaking, there isn't much to say.

A great many of these books are historical essays with titles such as The

Waning of Aerdy, Rulers of the House of Rax, The Age of Sorrow, The Rain of

Colorless Fire, The Battle of a Fortnight's Length, The Battle of

Shamblefield, People of the Blemu Hills, Unique Creatures of the Adri Forest,

Wee Folk of the Flinty Hills, Mg Travels Down the Teesar and Harp Rivers, etc.

All of these books are about local regions of the Flanaess (see the WORLD OF

GREYHAWK~ campaign setting for further details).

A dedicated search of at least an hour, specifically looking through these

historical works about the Flanaess, will unearth a copy of Azalin's life

story. This is different from the book found in the Hall of Records (see

above), but it has the same relevant passages. Tucked  inside the volume is a

loose sheet of paper, torn from a diary penned by Azalin himself. Give the

players a copy of the Book of Firan Zal'honan found in the back of this

adventure. This is the second handout in the back of this booklet.

In addition to the historical works, there are many books 'on occult topics,

including Van Richten's famous volumes. There are also many magical books, but

no spellbooks. If six people search for half an hour, they get one roll on

Table 95: Misc. Magic Books, Librams, Manuals, Tomes in the Dungeon Master's

Guide. A detect magic spell will speed this up considerably. Elzarath, the

ghostly librarian, can find any single work in a couple of rounds. However, he

will find books for the PCs only if they have been nice to him, and even then,

no more than one magical book.



35. Guest Rooms: These suites are bedrooms and temporary living quarters for

the few normal, living visitors that Azalin must occasionally entertain. They

are all empty at this time. Three of these rooms have secret doors that grant

access to a hidden corridor (room 36). Occasionally, Azalin has needed

surreptitious entrance to a guest's room.



36. Inner Bailey Wall: This dusty, cobweb-filled hallway runs through the

castle wall that surrounds the inner bailey. It is lined with arrow slits.

Each arrow slit has a hole, covered with a wooden lid, that looks down over

the wall. This overhang allows deadly objects to be rained down upon

besiegers.

Unlike the inner wall of the lower level, the corridor is fairly broad here.

It is patrolled by a pair of skeletons at all times. Since they are so easily

turned or destroyed, their combat abilities are not provided.



37. Room of Abjuration: One of the 10 rooms of magic, all abjuration spells

cast here are done so as if the caster were two levels higher. All saving

throws vs. abjurations suffer a -2 penalty here. A long shelf against the

straight southwest wall has all the spell components necessary to cast any

abjuration spell. The entire room has a permanent protection from good spell

affecting it. Anyone of good alignment suffers -- 2 penalties to attack rolls.

Any attacks by these characters that require saving throws allow evilly

aligned creatures a +2 bonus on the saving throw.



38. Outer Bailey Wall: This tunnel connects the gate towers to the main keep.

It is patrolled by a doom guard.



39. Gate Towers: The rooms on Level 6 are empty. There are stairs in each

tower leading both up and down. A hallway connects the two tower rooms. In the

middle of the hall is an alcove with two murder holes. The holes have heavy

metal plates covering them. The twin holes look down over the outside of the

gateway. In a normal castle, these would be used to drop burning pitch on

anyone in front of the gate. This area is patrolled by the doom guards.



40. Room of Wild Magic: One of the 10 rooms of magic, all wild magic spells

cast here are done so as if the caster were 2 levels higher. All saving throws

vs. wild magic suffer a -2 penalty here. A small shelf against the west wall

has all the spell components necessary to cast any wild magic spell. The floor

is an eye-straining, multicolored mess. To make matters worse, it slowly

changes, with various colors oozing and shifting across it.

Any spell cast in this room, regardless of school, has a 10% chance of causing

a wild surge. This is in addition to any rolls that a wild mage must make for

his spells.

Azalin hates this room. His curse is that he may never learn new magic. Wild

magic is a relatively new phenomenon and he is unable to learn it or

understand it in any way. He keeps the door to this room wizard locked at all

times. The archlich will not attack or approach the characters in here. He is

uncomfortable with the unstable nature of all spells that are cast here.



41. Gate Towers: This level holds the watch rooms for the gate towers.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

The room is filled with unusually thick spider webs. They are so dense that it

is impossible to see more than a dozen feet into them. Strangely, the webs do

not come within more than a pace or two of the wall. The curving stone of the

outer wall is punctured by arrow slits every few feet.   END



There is a clear path along the wall, encircling the entire floor. This path

is created by the doom guard patrols as they make their rounds. The animated

armors peer out of each and every arrow slit as they walk the tower. The path

is just wide enough to accommodate one character. Treat anyone falling into

the webs as if affected by a web spell.

If a spider has been foolish enough to spin a web across the pathway, the doom

guard cuts through it. The spiders have learned over the years that these

armored figures are immune to their poisonous bite. Occasionally, they still

attack a doom guard, which almost always results in the death of the spider.

If the PCs spend more than a couple of rounds here, the spiders attack them.

They attack unarmored characters and try to web the armored ones. There are

about two dozen spiders spread throughout these towers, but only a few attack

at a time.

Any flames in this area will ignite the webs and in turn, the dry timbers of

the roof. The fire will not spread, since the castle is largely stone, but

Azalin will have to build a new roof here. The first round of fire does only

one point of damage to each character in it. The next round does 1d6, the next

2d6, then 3d6, etc. The spiders are a nuisance encounter, but a fire could be

deadly.



Spiders, Large (6): Int Animal; AC 8; MV 6, Web 15; HD 1+1; hp 6 each; THACO

19; PAT 1; Dmg 1d6; SA poison (type A, save at +2 or suffer 15 pts dmg),

webbing; SZ S (2'); ML 7; XP 175; AL N.



42. Outer Bailey Walk: This is the top of the high wall that overlooks the

outer bailey. It is patrolled by doom guards. The door that connects to the

abjuration room (37) is locked.



43. Room of Necromancy: One of the 10 rooms of magic, all necromantic spells

cast here are done so as if the caster were 2 levels higher. All saving throws

vs. necromancy spells suffer a -2 penalty here. A long shelf against the

northwest wall has all the spell components necessary to cast any necromancy

spell. Any attempt to turn undead here is done so at a -2 penalty, in addition

to the overall -2 penalty of Castle Avernus.

There is an open balcony that spans the entire southwest wall, overlooking the

conjuration room. A railed catwalk bridges the short gap to the thick central

pillar with its spiral stair. If the characters are attacked by the wraiths

and spectres from that room, they _ might retreat here. Such a retreat plays

right into the hands of these undead monsters, since they are harder to turn

here. The stairs that curl around the central pillar lead to the treasury on

the next floor.

There is a secret door behind the shelf that leads to the hanging tower. It

can be found only if the characters specifically say that they are searching

the shelf or behind it, or trying to move the shelf while searching for secret

doors. A normal search of the room will not reveal this secret door.



44. Room of Elemental Magic: One of the 10 rooms of magic, this is somewhat

different from the rest. Elemental magic is not a single school like the

others. It is composed of four areas of specialization, one for each of the

primary elements.

The south end of this room is the focus of the special elements. There are

four square plots, separated from each other by a 10-foot-wide walkway. Each

square is filled with the appropriate element. The water square is a shallow

pool of bloody water about two feet deep. The earth square is a pit of dirt of

the  same depth. The fire square is shallow and filled with ash. The skeletal

remains of a human are hidden beneath the dust, and in the center is a small

brazier with a burning fire. The remainder of the pit is surrounded by

oil-soaked logs. Contact with any source of flame will ignite them.

The air square is outlined by a line carved into the stone. It is otherwise

empty. 1t has direct access to an arrow slit, providing an unlimited supply of

air.

The following passage should be read when the PCs first enter the room,

assuming that they can see only the first 40 to 60 feet of it.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

This room is quite long and wide. To your left are four shelves, stocked with

many strange powders, liquids, and bizarre objects. To your right is an

orderly stack of barrels.   END



Once the PCs are able to see the back part of the room, they should hear the

following.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

Four squares are laid out on the floor with broad pathways between them. A

circle carved in the floor and inscribed with strange runes is centered

between the squares, so that one corner of each square touches its curving

edge. The nearest square on the left is a pool of ominous, dark red fluid. The

thick smell of oil wafts past you. The near square on the right is a pit of

dirt. You can see a few bleached white bones protruding from the soil.

The far left square is an empty area on the floor, outlined by a line chiseled

into the stone. The far right square is a shallow pit, haphazardly filled with

firewood. Bones can be seen mixed in with the lumber. In its center, a brass

bowl contains a burning fire.   END



In the center, touching a corner of each plot, is a magic circle. A true

elemental wizard can stand in this circle and cast any elemental magic spell,

even one from an element that opposes his own. He does so as if two levels

higher than normal, and anyone saving against one of his elemental spells

suffers a -2 penalty.

Four long shelves against the east wall hold all the spell components

necessary to cast any elemental magic spell. There is one shelf for each

element. Stacked along the opposite, curved wall are barrels of supplies that

might be needed in large quantity. They hold dirt, water, various types of

flammable oil, etc.

The ceiling is a peaked roof, about 45 feet high in the center. Several large

timbers cut across the empty space and support the massive roof. An inverted

cone of stone grows out of the curved west wall. This is the base of the

vampire tower.

Although elemental magic is a relatively new school of magic, Azalin is still

able to cast some spells here. However, he cannot take advantage of the magic

circle. The archlich also does not bear the hatred for this room that he does

for the wild magic room.

From the magic circle, Azalin is able to summon Ravenloft elementals

(alternate: ordinary elementals). Try as he might, he is unable to summon

elementals of any other sort. As long as he stays within the circle, control

over them is automatic.

Azalin has summoned a grave elemental and a blood elemental (alternates: earth

and water elementals) to act as guardians in this room. He tried keeping one

elemental of each type here, but the elementals always attacked their opposite

(fire G water, earth G air). He now settles for two. The grave elemental will

not attack the castle structure. Neither elemental can leave this room.

45. Inner Bailey Wall: This broad walkway has battlements overlooking the

countryside. Its inner edge has no protective railing. It is a 60-foot drop to

the inner bailey below. This wall is patrolled by a pair of doom guards,

walking in opposite directions.



46. Golem Room: This is where Azalin builds his golems. Before he was

installed as the lord of Darkon, the archlich discovered how to make bone

golems and zombie golems. They are quite difficult to create and the process

takes a long time. To make matters worse, Azalin does not always have time to

devote to them. Once every decade or so, he completes a golem and sends it out

on a special quest, or keeps it in the castle to serve as a special guardian.





READ THE FOLLOWING:

This room looks like a slaughter house. Piles of body parts stretch beyond the

edge of your light. The smell of decaying flesh is overpowering.

In the middle of all this carnage is a table, bearing a horror beyond

comprehension. A madman has been sewing these rotting body parts together.

They are not joined in any rational way that would form a human body. Arms are

strapped together to form a leg, a head is attached where the stomach should

be, etc. It is the work of a deranged mind.   END



The piles of body parts are actually sorted neatly -- arms here, legs there,

etc. Piles of dried human bones are also sorted by type. In the middle of all

this are two large tables. One bears a partially assembled zombie golem, the

other a partially assembled bone golem. A third, smaller table stands between

the two. It is covered with dozens of sharp tools and other instruments

necessary to build the golems.

The sight of this room is cause for a horror check. Anyone attempting to

closely examine the zombie golem on the table or search through the piles of

body parts must make another horror check.

Azalin has kept a zombie golem here as a  servant and guardian (alternate:

eight Strahd zombies). When the archlich doesn't immediately need this

servant, the golem sits lifeless in a corner of the room. Anyone glancing over

the room will fail to notice the golem, since it looks like another pile of

body parts. If anyone approaches it or specifically declares to be examining

the piles of body parts, then the characters notice the golem. The golem will

attack anyone disturbing anything in this room. If the characters walk

through, looking but not touching, the golem is not activated.

47. Gate Tower Roof: This roof level is simply open wooden timbers, filled

with spider webs. The roof is 30 feet high from base to top. The large spiders

that live here feed primarily on bats, birds, and rats.



48. Treasury: This is Azalin's second treasury. Like the first, it has little

need of guardians. Azalin does not care much about wealth, and few thieves

would dare break into his castle, let alone survive the experience. The only

entrance is through the stairway in the room of necromancy.

This treasury is reserved for finer types of wealth. Nothing so crude as

coinage is found here. Rare paintings hang on the walls, intricately woven

carpets are tightly rolled and stacked on the floor, and statuary is scattered

everywhere. The value of any given piece is 1d100 x 10 gp. If the characters

start packing away treasure, stress their awkwardness and bulk. There is far

more here than they can ever hope to carry. All encumbrance rules apply.

Seven small chests are tucked away in various odd corners. Six contain 3d6

gems of  varying quality. Like the coins in the other treasury, a minor curse

is placed on these. The curse functions only if the gems are re- moved from

Castle Avernus without Azalin's permission. There is a 50% chance each time a

gem is handled that the image of Azalin will be seen within its crystalline

depths. This is cause for a fear check, even outside the demiplane of

Ravenloft.

The seventh chest contains a priest scroll with the following spells: heal,

restoration, raise dead, resurrection.



49. Velvet Cage: This room is a special prison cell. From the inside, it looks

like the private bedroom of a princess. A large bed with silk sheets dominates

the room, and an exquisite bathtub hides coyly behind a delicately painted

screen. The walls are covered with bright, cheery tapestries. A small table

and a few chairs, all elegantly crafted, stand near a fireplace. A wardrobe

closet contains an assortment of fine clothing for both men and women. A shelf

holds books and writing papers behind delicate glass doors. All the books are

commonplace histories and great works of fiction.

Azalin uses this room as a prison cell for his more genteel captives. Those

people whose minds would snap too quickly in the torture chambers are kept

here for more subtle and delicate questioning. A trap door in the floor leads

to the circular stairway (and freedom), but it is barred from the underside.

The room is currently empty.



50. Room of Invocation: One of the 10 rooms of magic, all invocation spells

cast here are done so as if the caster were 2 levels higher. All saving throws

vs. invocations suffer a -2 penalty here. A long shelf against the west wall

holds all the spell components necessary to cast any invocation spell.



51. Room of Alteration: One of the 10 rooms of magic, all alteration spells

cast here are done so as if the caster were 2 levels higher. All saving throws

vs. alterations suffer a -2 penalty here. A long shelf against the south wall

holds all the spell components necessary to cast any alteration spell. In the

center of the room is an iron ring with several chains hooked to it. Each ends

in a manacle suitable for restraining prisoners.

Cages line the east and west walls of this room. Each cage holds an animal or

monster. All are victims of Azalin's polymorph spells. Most are actually

humans and demihumans. As a result, each animal or monster radiates magic if

the characters detect for it. Stacked cages on the east wall hold small,

innocuous animals: mice, rabbits, frogs, cats, snakes, bats, males, and so on.



The eight 10' x 10' cages on the west wall hold the larger or more dangerous

animals. One cage is empty. The table below shows polymorphed forms and true

forms of each animal.



Polymorphed         True Form

Dairy cow       4th-level paladin, female

Tenebrous worm      Carpet merchant, male

Gremishka       9th-level enchantress

Baboon          Barmaid

Mongrelman      3rd-level thief, male

Giant leech         Tax collector, male

Halfling female         Mind flayer



If released from her enchantment, the paladin is most grateful. Her name is

Rose, and she will gladly join the party. She is unarmed and unarmored. The

carpet merchant is a fat slug of a man with an annoying whine.

Coryn is a chaotic evil, 9th-level enchantress who is being punished by Azalin

for minor infractions. She claims to be a housewife, married to a scribe who

besmirched Azalin's name. She will wait for an opportune moment to escape,

preferably with a magical item or two. If the party confronts Azalin, her fear

of the archlich will cause her to instantly attack the PCs, hoping to get back

in his good graces.

Coryn has no spellbooks or equipment.  Unless one of the PCs lends her a

spellbook, she is unable to memorize or cast spells.

Winaya the barmaid is a work-worn, middle-aged woman. If ever called upon to

make a fear or horror check, she faints dead away for 2d6 rounds, but suffers

no other ill effects.

Slippery Siv was once a proud burglar until he stole a small statuette that

Azalin coveted. Now he is a frightened weasel of a man whose loyalty shifts

with the wind. He will stay with the party only as long as they provide him

safety.

Milarn is a pompous tax collector who cheated the Kargat. As punishment, they

gave him to Azalin as a gift.

The mind flayer will attack instantly if returned to its true form. It knows

that the characters will not allow it to live.

If any of these characters joins the party, they function basically as meat.

If the DM must kill a party member to illustrate a point, these characters are

the perfect choice. Azalin will always attack them first.

52. Vampire Tower: This lonely tower is part of the home of Aquinus, a vampire

servant of Azalin. Although servitude to the archlich grates upon him, his

fear is far greater than his hatred. Aquinus is utterly loyal, knowing that a

horrible fate is assured if he were ever to betray the archlich. Some things

are even feared by a vampire.

The tower is a series of small rooms, connected only by small holes in the

ceiling, (the floor of the room above). The rooms are universally dusty and

filled with cobwebs.

On the lowest level of the tower, adjacent to the divination room, there is a

small crack in the stonework that connects the two rooms. Any dwarf that

examines the walls is guaranteed to discover the crack. The crack is only a

few feet long and a fraction of an inch wide. This is just enough to allow the

vampire's gaseous form to enter and leave. This lowest  room is also where

Aquinus's coffin is concealed.



53. Room of Divination: One of the 10 rooms of magic, all divination spells

cast here are done so as if the caster were 2 levels higher. All  saving

throws vs. divinations cast within this room suffer a -2 penalty. A long shelf

against the north wall holds all the spell components necessary to cast any

divination spell.

In the center of this room is a wide, shallow pool of clear water. Floating a

few feet above the pool is a crystal ball measuring 5 feet in diameter.

Hanging on the southwest wall is an immense mirror, fully 40 feet wide and 10

feet high. The pool and the mirror are used for scrying.

The crystal ball acts as the typical magical item. Simply by concentrating,

the characters can use it. The DM should read the description of the crystal

ball in the DMG carefully. Unlike most crystal balls, this one can focus on

domain lords. With it, Azalin is able to occasionally spy upon the other

domain lords.

The archlich can sense anyone viewing him through the crystal ball He is able

to mentally reach out and attempt to charm anyone who uses it to spy on him.

Roll for this secretly, and tell the player only if the charm attempt failed.

In that case, the character was able to feel the insidious attention of the

lich as it tried to invade his mind. If the character fails his save, he

should be told about Azalin's current activity, but nothing else. Later in

this adventure when the PCs confront Azalin, that character will turn traitor

and attack his comrades.



54. Hanging Tower: This tower room is empty.



55. Room of Illusion: One of the 10 rooms of magic, all illusion spells cast

here take effect as if the caster were 2 levels higher. All saving throws vs.

illusions suffer a -2 penalty here. A long shelf against the west wall holds

all the spell components necessary to cast any illusion spell. The shelf of

spell components appears to be bolted to the wall. Any spell designed to

dispel or reveal illusions will not work here, but it is possible to

disbelieve them.

The floor of this room is completely transparent. Only the top of the 20-foot

diameter pillar, which lies even with the floor, and the area between the

doors are visible. Anyone standing there looks down 60 feet to the floor of

the conjuration room. The floor is quite solid and can be walked on safely,

even by the heaviest of creatures. The ceiling and walls are smooth, yielding

no place to secure ropes or grappling hooks.

To make matters worse, there are curved holes in the invisible floor. Of

course, it is impossible to detect a hole in an invisible floor. Anyone

falling through such a hole suffers a 60-foot fall (6d6 damage). Any remaining

wraiths and spectres will descend upon a falling character like a black swarm.

All such creatures that were turned during a combat in the conjuration room

can return to attack.

Skeever could decide to use his improved phantasmal force spell here. It will

work particularly well, since it is an illusion spell. Any character fleeing

the sight of Azalin is quite likely to fall into a hole and plummet into the

conjuration room.



56. Attic: This area is filled with dust, cobwebs, and support timbers.



57. Hangman's Walk: This battlement encircles one of the large towers of the

main keep. At the back of the tower is a stair that climbs to the top of the

other tower of the main keep. As the walk rounds the Hanging Tower, it passes

below an arch that forms part of the buttress for the tower. A large metal

loop is mounted on the outside of the buttress, and a steel chain dangles tram

the loop. A second chain is attached to the loop and has a hook on the end, in

easy reach of anyone on the walk.

Whenever Azalin wants to make an example of someone who has wronged him, he

hangs him from the hook. Those guilty of minor infractions are hung by the

neck from a rope.  Death is swift for them. After a few days, the rope is cut

and the body tumbles to the base of the tower for the vultures. Serious

offenders are hung on the hook itself, alive and kicking. Death comes slowly

and painfully. After a few days, they too are dropped to the rocks below.

A doom guard constantly walks from one end of this wall to the other. However,

the guard is not the most important inhabitant of the Hangman's Walk. A

wrongly accused man, hung on the hook decades ago by Azalin, rose as an undead

creature: a valpurgeist (alternate: ghost). It haunts Hangman's Walk,

particularly around the arch.

Azalin takes amusement in letting it hang around. The archlich has commanded

the valpurgeist to serve as his executioner. The undead wretch must hang or

hook anyone Azalin has condemned to die. It assumes that any living creature

on the walk must be hanged or hooked, and attacks them. Its morale is

significantly higher than normal due to the power of Azalin's orders.

Seeing the valpurgeist with its broken neck and dangling head is cause for a

horror check. If the DM is using a ghost instead of the valpurgeist, it is

able to manipulate the chains and hook, but not any other physical objects.

58a-d. Aquinus's Rooms: These rooms are home to the vampire Aquinus, described

in room 52. That tower is where the vampire actually rests. These rooms allow

him to live out a mortal masquerade. The rooms appear to be an elegant suite,

decorated in an exquisite but subdued manner. Only the door leading to the

tower and the door leading to the hallway are locked. The door leading to the

main hall is also barred from the outside.

Room 58a is a study and drawing room. Room 58b is a small library. Nothing of

great note or value is found here. Room 58c is a bedroom. The bed has never

been used. Ironically, an arrow slit lets the morning sun shine on the

mattress. The wardrobe closet contains fine clothes and an executioner's

uniform complete with black hood.

Room 58d is a dining hall. It is something of a mockery, since Aquinus is the

only resident of the suite and does not eat mortal food. At the back end of

this room is the locked door to the tower (room 52).

If the characters enter these rooms, Aquinus will be in the study (room 58a).

He will feign being a prisoner of Azalin. He refers to himself as Azalin's

"reluctant guest." There is some cause to believe this, since the only obvious

entrance to his rooms is locked and barred from the outside.

As a vampire, he has the ability to turn gaseous and seep under the door or

turn into a bat and fly out the arrow slit. He is in no way a prisoner

restricted to these rooms. Aquinus is a prisoner to his fear of Azalin.

Aquinus will make no overt attempt to harm or help the characters yet.

However, he will try to charm one of them with his gaze. Roll the character's

saving throw secretly, but tell the player only if the attempt failed.

Aquinus's plan is to follow the PCs as a bat or in gaseous form. At some

point, he hopes to get the charmed PC alone, then drain him. The Dungeon

Master must decide when such an occasion presents itself.

59. Execution Chamber: This large, open room is filled with devices used to

execute prisoners. These include Is a guillotine, an impaling spear, a

medieval dunk tank (for drownings), a  chopping block and executioner's axe,

an iron pole surrounded by dry firewood (for burnings), and so on. The only

obvious method of execution missing is a gallows, that action always takes

place on the hanging tower for all to see.

Most persons executed here are hung on the hook at some point, like carcasses

in a butcher's shop. A single, large cell lies to the rear of the room, where

prisoners await their fates. It is currently empty.

The vampire Aquinus serves as executioner for Azalin. He is detailed in rooms

52 and 58. The superhuman strength and powers of the vampire make him ideal

for the task. Aquinus takes no pleasure in this job, since he is never allowed

to drain the victims before slaying them.



60. Room of Silence: This barren room has a permanent silence spell cast upon

it. No sound can be made or heard within its walls. Azalin comes here

regularly to vent his rage and frustration, and on rare occasions, to confess

his sins. He can speak freely without fear of anyone overhearing him. Although

the lich cannot hear his own words, it is enough to feel himself saying them.



 61. Tower Roof: There is no trapdoor or other entry into the lowest room of

this tower. Azalin and Aquinus both use its rooftop to look out over the

shrouded landscape of Darkon. Sometimes peasants in nearby villages can see a

lone, brooding figure on the parapets, gazing outward.



62. Crypt of Irik Zal'honan: This is the burial crypt of Azalin's son. When

the archlich first entered Ravenloft, his only child was still buried in his

home plane. When Azalin stepped into the mists and Darkon was created, this

crypt appeared. No creature, living or dead, knows for sure whether the crypt

and body were transported to Ravenloft or if this is a replica created to

taunt the archlich. Azalin believes it to be the true tomb of his son.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

Dim light from a ceiling sconce casts shadows into the far corners of this

room. Dusty, moth-eaten tapestries hang from sagging rods on the walls.

Centered under the light is a massive stone coffin. All sides of it are

elaborately carved and sculpted.   END



The dim light is a continual light stone mounted into the ceiling sconce and

veiled with a pane of yellow quartz. The shade of Azalin's dead son haunts

this room. He will rise from the coffin only if a character approaches within

5 feet of it.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

As you draw near the coffin, a white, transparent form rises up through the

stone lid. Clearly, it is the spirit of someone long dead, and tendrils of

fear begin to gnaw at the corners of your mind.   END



Irik is a full ghost, possessing all the powers listed for ghosts in the

Monstrous Compendium. However, he has no interest in attacking  innocent

strangers. He will use his supernatural powers only to defend himself. He will

even ignore the first round of attacks, unless they seriously harm him.

Irik is a soul full of forgiveness and compassion, the exact opposite of his

father. Irik is quite willing to talk to the characters. He can summarize

everything in the two handouts at the back of this booklet. He alone, of all

the creatures in Azalin's foul lair, knows where the phylactery is located. If

asked, he will tell them that it is in a special room three floors above this

one. Since he has never left his crypt, he has no idea what the room looks

like or what defenses Azalin has installed.

63.  Hallway: This room is empty.



64. Shadow Lair: This huge room spans two floors of the tower. Its ceiling is

nearly 30 feet high. At the south end of the room is a gaping, round hole, 25

feet in diameter. A railed balcony clings to the north wall, spanning the

reach between the two small towers. At the center of this balcony is a

10-foot-long stone protrusion that is not railed. Azalin uses it to mount his

dragon steed, Ebb, who makes his home here. The floor is covered in silver

coins, a fitting bed for a dragon.

Ebb is an adult shadow dragon (alternate: black dragon) and Azalin's flying

mount. Shadow dragons are native to Oerth and are described in the Monstrous

Compendium for the GREYHAWK~ campaign setting. Since Azalin is native to that

realm, it makes sense that he would use a native creature as his personal

steed.

Ebb hates most living creatures and cannot be negotiated with. Fortunately for

the PCs, they can avoid this room by climbing the stairs on the outside of the

tower.

Ebb is probably too tough an encounter for the characters at this point. Use

her to frighten the characters rather than kill them. This dragon helps serve

as an example of Azalin's power. Read this passage when they first enter the

room.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

The room is huge, clearly spanning more than one floor of the tower. A balcony

hugs one wall, with several doorways on and under it. Opposite the balcony is

a huge, round hole in the wall. It stands as tall as the mast on a sailing

ship. The cavernous room is filled with shadows. The floor seems to glint and

sparkle in the moonlight, except for a broad pool of darkness in the center.

In the distance, you can hear tortured screams.

A large serpentine head arises from the shadowy pool on the floor. Slanted

eyes glow like moonlight as they swivel to look directly at you. The soft

rustling of leather can be heard as two enormous, batlike wings unfurl. A wave

of supernatural fear washes over you.   END



Ebb does not attack immediately, giving the characters a chance to flee. She

enjoys instilling fear in pathetic little humans almost as much as she enjoys

devouring them. If the PCs flee, the shadow dragon does not pursue them. If

they stick around for any reason, she unleashes her breath weapon.

From anywhere on this level of the castle and upward, the banshee's screams

can be heard, even by non-elves. Her cries of agony provide a steady,

terrifying backdrop from here on.



65. Hanging Tower: These two levels of the hanging tower connect into Ebb's

lair.



66. Lower Keep Roof: This rooftop Is patrolled by a pair of doom guards. The

moans and shrieks of the banshee in its tower are easily heard here. Even

non-elves can identify the banshee tower as the source of the awful cries.

From anywhere on this level of the castle and upward, the banshee's screams

can be heard, even by non-elves. Her cries of agony provide a steady,

terrifying backdrop from here on.



67. Lower Banshee Tower: These two levels of the banshee tower open into Ebb's

lair. A stairway leads upward, providing an entrance to the next floor.

Willow, the banshee, cannot enter these two floors of the tower.



68. Upper Banshee Tower: This tower is haunted by a groaning spirit. In life,

Willow was a strong-minded elf maiden. She entered the service of Azalin,

drawn to the power that he could give her. She proved to be ruthless and

bloodthirsty, rare traits for any elf. Unfortunately, she was also ambitious.

Willow betrayed Azalin and he hung her on the hook to die (see room 57). He

then raised her spirit as a banshee and forced her to inhabit his tower. She

now serves as a warning to anyone who would betray Azalin.

Villagers for miles around can hear her constant cries of agony. Azalin made

sure that the story of her betrayal and subsequent punishment was spread far

and wide throughout Darkon. Villagers believe that Willow is kept alive by

Azalin's powerful magic to be eternally tortured. They do not realize that she

is now an undead spirit.

Willow still appears as a beautiful, young elf maid, just as she was at the

time of her death. However, she now has a huge, ghostly hook stuck in her

back. Its point thrusts through the front of her chest. Like all groaning

spirits, she is herself a ghostly, transparent figure.

Willow serves Azalin in death almost as well as she served him in life. He has

bound her to this tower as the first guardian of his phylactery. There is no

entrance to the phylactery room that does not go through her tower. As stated

in the Monstrous Compendium, she can sense the presence of living creatures

several miles away. There is no chance of slipping past her. Willow

immediately attacks if the characters enter her tower. On the first round, she

releases her death wail.

69. Dead End Tower: This part of the hanging tower rises one level and ends in

an empty room.



70. Hall of Life: This room is unusual for Castle Avernus. It is devoted to

the principle of life, a concept almost alien to Azalin. The special

properties of this room improve all healing or life-restoring spells. Healing

spells always cure at their maximum effectiveness. All life-creating and

restoring spells (clone, simulacrum, raise dead, resurrection, regeneration,

restoration, reincarnation) work automatically, without normal penalties to

the caster or to the target. No system shock rolls are necessary here.

Any undead creature loses one hit point every round it remains in this room.

Azalin suffers extreme pain while in this room. Each  round, he loses a hit

point and then regenerates it (a power granted by his imp familiar). However,

his will is so strong that he has never flinched from entering this room and

he makes no outward sign of the pain. The normal penalties of Castle Avernus

(as a sinkhole of evil) do not apply here, unless Azalin himself is present.



READ THE FOLLOWING:

A soft yellow glow comes from the walls of this room. You did not realize the

full weight of the dread and despair that this foul castle placed upon you

until just now. A small flame of hope is kindled in your heart.

Toward the rear of this huge, circular room are eight mist-shrouded pillars.

Each rests upon a faceted, clear green stone as broad as a man's outstretched

arms. A column of slowly shifting mists rises up from each gem, forming the

pillars. As the mist touches the ceiling, it seems to dissipate. You see

still, dark shapes hidden in light white vapors.

The stones and misty pillars form a circle several paces across. In the center

is a square table covered with vials, jars, strange tools, and other devices.

The room is otherwise devoid of furniture.   END



The green stones are magical emeralds of gigantic size. The generative power

of these stones can take any bit of flesh and grow a clone from it, just like

the clone spell. The emeralds are permanently fixed to the floor and cannot be

removed or chipped.

Within each of the misty columns is a naked, teenaged clone of one of the

player characters. It will be a month or more before they are fully grown.

The mists can easily be waved or fanned away from the bodies to reveal their

faces.   The mists reshroud the body within a round after a disturbance is

removed.

Removing a body from the mists kills the clone, as will a simple sword thrust.

Azalin will make no attempt to prevent this, since he has bits of the

characters' flesh stored away elsewhere in the castle. He can grow new clones

at any time if he so chooses.

The first character to wave the mists away from one of the bodies sees his own

face. This requires an instant horror check. Roll randomly for the other

pillars to determine which characters are there. A character seeing his own

clone must make a horror check, although after the first character makes one,

everyone else gets a +3 bonus. They already know what they will see, and they

are not as shocked by the sight.

At the DM's option, the clone of any dead player can be discovered fully grown

instead of young. Removing a fully grown clone from the mists is safe, and

will awaken it within a few rounds. In this way, a player can recover his

character. Of course, the character will have no memories since dying under

the blade of the headless horseman.

If the player characters fail in their quest for Azalin, the archlich intends

to use their clones to try again. However, Skeever the imp has a fiendishly

clever and evil plan. He has placed a scroll on the table along with the odd

devices, beakers of fluids, and spell components. If the characters attempt to

read the scroll, give them the handout at the back of this booklet.

Skeever is trying to make the characters believe that they are just clones.

Every character who reads or hears the contents of this false scroll must make

a horror check. Comparing the scroll to any of the other written works of

Azalin will instantly reveal it to be a forgery because the handwriting

doesn't match at all.



71. Phylactery Room: It is no coincidence that this room sits directly above

the Hall of Life. Although there is no known physical or magical connection,

Azalin likes to think that in some way, his phylactery, which contains his

life essence, is enhanced by being so close to the Hall of Life.

The only entrance to this room is through the Banshee Tower (room 68).



READ THE FOLLOWING:

To your right is a straight, continuous wall. The rest of the huge room is

round, roughly filling the entire tower's diameter. The walls are intricately

carved and painted, many of the scenes drawn in silver and barely visible in

the dull light. The floor and ceiling are plain, unadorned stone. There are no

other doors or entrances.

In the center of the room, facing the flat wall, is a wide, round pedestal

that rises waist high. Resting atop it is a golden dragon's skull. The only

light in the room comes from a flickering flame visible in its partially open

mouth. Its eyes glow a dull red, ominously reminiscent of Azalin's eyes.   END



The paintings on the walls depict the life of Azalin in great detail. Each

picture is captioned in Old Oeridian. Toward the middle of his life story is

the scene showing him becoming a lich. His phylactery is displayed prominently

as a gold-plated, shrunken skull on a chain around his neck. Toward the end of

his life story, the pictures show his transition into the demiplane of

Ravenloft. The skull is shown being altered magically to become a huge dragon

skull, matching the one on the pedestal.

The dragon skull is that of a Greyhawk Dragon (see the GREYHAWK~ campaign

Monstrous Compendium) plated in gold. As a result, any attempt to identify the

exact species of dragon fails unless a character is native to that realm.

Azalin's phylactery is this skull. As stated earlier, it was altered magically

from an ordinary skull into this massive, almost immovable dragon skull. It

stands as yet another symbol of Azalin's imprisonment here. The interior of

the braincase contains all of the mystical writings necessary to make it a

suitable vessel for Azalin's life essence. This phylactery cannot be opened or

destroyed by any means available to the characters. Even dropping it from the

top of Castle Avernus will not damage it.

An ever-burning flame, about the size of a torch flame, is set in the mouth.

Its light is reflected through two rubies set as eyes, making them appear to

glow. No amount of water, wind, or cold can extinguish the flame.

Next to the flame is a small, golden disc that can be removed from inside the

dragon's mouth. It can be seen only by someone peering directly into the mouth

of the skull from a close distance. Azalin placed the disc here after

inscribing a message upon it. It is a cryptic reference to the concept that if

Azalin (death that walks) touches this phylactery (life unmoving), he will be

destroyed. Of course, Azalin himself designed this trap with the potential to

kill him. It is all part of his grand scheme. Normally, his phylactery has no

deadly affect upon him.



Should life unmoving touch death that walks, life must prevail, for golden

life, even unmoving, is the nemesis of death.



The skull itself weighs 200 pounds. It measures 4'/z feet from snout to base.

Although difficult to lift and carry, the phylactery can be rolled. Any

character rolling it moves at a speed of 3 plus his strength damage bonus. No

amount of added strength or extra people rolling it can get it moving faster

than a rate of 9. Obviously, if it is dropped out a window or rolled down a

staircase, its speed would exceed 9.

Only one thing stands in the way of the characters taking the phylactery: the

second guardian, a greater guardian daemon. Its lair lies behind the flat wall

of this room. The middle 20 feet of this wall is a one-way illusion. From

inside the narrow lair, the illusionary section of the wall is invisible. The

daemon can clearly see and hear anyone entering the room and prepare its

attack.

The daemon's strategy is to wait until the characters' attentions are

completely focused on the phylactery. It then rushes out and breathes fire on

them. Of course, it is smart enough to take advantage of any unique situations

and change its strategy accordingly.

72.  Main Keep Roof: This roof is patrolled by two doom guards. Occasionally,

Azalin stands at the walls and looks out over his lands. To the north, he can

see the road and II Aluk. To the south is wilderness spotted with peasant

villages.



73-76. Azalin's Rooms: These are the archlich's private quarters. Only

Skeever, his imp familiar, and Erasmus, his spirit butler, are allowed in

here. Spanning two floors, these rooms are a mockery of everything that Azalin

had in life. The lich spends a few hours here about once a week. He cannot

stand to be reminded of the creature comforts of life more often than that.

Frequently, he will break or destroy something here before storming out.

As mentioned above, Erasmus is a ghostly spirit that serves as Azalin's butler

and manservant in these rooms. He keeps everything in order, dusting and

cleaning when necessary, lighting the lamps, drawing warm baths, etc.

Erasmus appears to be completely solid and real, but cannot be touched.

Physical objects pass right through him. By concentrating, he can move

physical objects around, making it look as if his hands are manipulating them.



Erasmus has no desire to harm anyone. He is a slave, bound to Azalin through

the powers granted the lich by the demiplane of dread.

Erasmus looks like a stereotypical butler. He is an elderly man with gray

hair, and is a bit too wide around the middle. He dresses in black formal wear

at all times. Erasmus treats the characters courteously, asking them to wait

for "the master" to return. He is repairing a chair when they enter. He knows

nothing of value to the characters, rarely leaves these rooms, and will not

help the characters in any way, other than to offer them tea and biscuits.



73. Azalin's Dining Room: This is a small, elegant dining area. 1t has a table

surrounded by eight chairs and a wine cabinet. A sideboard holds a basket of

fresh bread.



74. Azalin's Study: A pair of overstuffed chairs form the centerpiece of this

room. A low table sits next to the chairs, a pile of scrolls neatly stacked on

it. The scrolls are writs of ownership for meager parcels of land in the hills

of Darkon -- all in all, quite dull reading. A fireplace and some shelves

stand to one side.



75. Azalin's Bedroom: A large canopy bed dominates the room. Twin wardrobe

closets hold many types of clothing, both men's and women's. Hanging on the

wall is a portrait of a woman (Azalin's dead wife) and a portrait of Irik (his

dead son). Both paintings were ripped to shreds by Azalin and then

painstakingly sewn back together by Erasmus (on more than one occasion). The

stitches are visible at a distance.



76. Azalin's Bath: A huge bathtub forms the centerpiece of this room. Cabinets

full of perfumes, soaps, and towels line the walls. The tub is cracked but

mortared together.



77. Banshee Tower Attic: This area is occupied only by dusty wooden beams and

cobwebs. The banshee is able to enter this attic.



78. King's Watch: This is the highest of all possible watch points in the

castle. Like similar lookouts, Azalin is occasionally seen as a dim figure

looking out over the landscape. From here, the road is visible to the west and

north, leading to Il Aluk, northeast of the castle.



79. Skeever's Room: Azalin's imp familiar, Skeever, lives here. Although a

stair leads to this room, Skeever rarely uses it. He usually  just flies in

and out of the castle through a convenient window.

This room is a foul waste pit. Imps are not noted for their cleanliness. Piles

of refuse and garbage abound. Rats and flies are everywhere.

The ceiling is over 30 feet high, since this room spans two levels. Wooden

beams and rafters crisscross the open space, making it an ideal home for a

small flying creature like Skeever. The imp usually sleeps high in these

rafters, in a small nest made of mud and bones.

As mentioned earlier, Azalin has granted his imp a special enchantment. By

uttering the word "sanctuary," he is instantly teleported to this room. When

the characters first escaped Azalin's control, he used this power to evade the

naga in the wizard's lab.</p>
