<p class="pagecaption">Diamond Spider Tavern</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For a cheap drink and cheaper thrills, there's no better tavern in the whole city than The Diamond Spider.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Over the stout oak door that is the main entrance to the tavern swings an octagonal sign which depicts a glistening arachnid framed against a dark web pattern. The sign reads 'The Diamond Spider - S. Braz, Proprietor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The specialty of the house at The Diamond Spider is a lethal concoction known as a "Spider's Web". It contains five varieties of hard alcohol, three fruit juices, and a drop or two of tincture of opium. The suggested limit is 3; most people have a hard time downing one. At 2 gold pieces, it is the most expensive libation offered. Ale, beer, wine, applejack, brandy, mead, rum, gin, usquebaugh, vodka, and corn liquor are also available, at prices ranging from a few coppers to 1 gold piece. Characters who wish to drink water, milk, or sasparilla had best find another establishment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">No hot food is offered; however, customers may order a cheese platter (which includes a large onion and some monstrously hot mustard) for only 3 silver pieces. Sticks of hard salted bread, salted fish, spicy jerked-beef strips, and green olives are placed on tables as "snacks".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While not exactly the lowest dive in town, The Diamond Spider's clientele is not the most savory. Thieves, courtesans, bandits, assassins, smugglers, spies, and other disreputable sorts mingle freely with the more honest inhabitants of the city. Brawls are frequent, rumors run rampant, and all manner of shady deals are consummated here. Ifs a very popular place!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Games</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dagger Pitching</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Players stand at one end of a 15' long "lane" and throw daggers at a 6' high wooden target. On the target is the outline of a man; the vital areas (heart, lungs, eyes, etc.) are represented in this outline. Players get three shots at the target with throwing daggers; they score points depending on the accuracy of the shot. Competition is fierce and sometimes dangerous.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The Diamond Spider has a regular dagger pitch league, but anyone who cares to join in when it isn't league night is welcome. The minimum throwing distance is 12'; ajudicate attempts based on the normal dagger-throwing mechanics of your system. (See the Dagger Boards, Section E in the Layout.)</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Spider Races</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Various arachnids are placed in glass-topped "lanes" and race for insects at the end of the lane. First spider there wins!</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Leg Wrestling</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Akin to arm-wrestling, except participants lay on the floor on their backs, side-to-side, their heads pointed in different directions. Players lock legs and try to flip each other over, a test of both strength and dexterity.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Howling COntests</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Patrons very simply try to out-howl each other.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Twezeliewop</p>

<p class="regtxt12">A large log is placed on the floor and two people face each other standing on the log. Each person must hold one hand behind his back; in his other hand he holds a large grain sack filled with goose feathers. Each player attempts to knock the other off the log by hitting him with the sack.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dice and Card Games</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The usual. None are "house" games, though the tavern can provide dice or cards.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Entertainment</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Entertainment is in the form of various exotic dancers, accompanied by some truly awful musicians; several jugglers; an occasional sleight-of-hand artist and a Storyteller. The Diamond Spider teems with activity and tables and chairs can be shuffled aside for a contest or game at a moments notice. Betting on games is a favorite pastime of the patrons. There are rumors that occasionally men with a grudge against each other are invited to fight duels to the death in the Tavern, and that such matches have been held more than once (this is true).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Layout</p>

<p>
	<IMG SRC="../../../common/place_images/DiamondSpiderMap.jpg">
</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The building itself measures 100' from east to west and 80' from north to south. It is about 20' high and has windows that are about 14' above the ground. Smaller barred windows serve as ventilation for the ground floor. There are three entrances/exits, all with doors of stout oak banded with iron; each door has a built-in lock3. They are all unlocked while the Tavern is in operation (roughly from noon till about 2:00 a.m.)</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The interior of the tavern is "split-level". A 10' wide top deck area runs around the entire tavern, bounded by a 3' high wooden railing. Stairs lead from the floor level to this top deck area, which is about 10' above the main floor. The bar, private booths, dagger pitching boards, party room, privies, and storage areas are all beneath the top deck.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Shadows abound throughout the tavern. Light comes from wheel chandeliers with candles in them. These chandeliers are hung from the ceiling and can be lowered by ropes, tied to the wooden rail around the top deck. They are ideal for swinging on during brawls.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A. Bar. (35' x 10') The bar is thick wood, about 4' high and 3' feet across. Liquors and wines are kept beneath it. Ale, beer, and brandy are served from the three casks which are set into the wall behind the bar. Various shelves hold goblets, mugs, and bar tools.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The bar is manned by three to five bartenders. Each carries two daggers, wears leather armor, and has a "change" belt (a leather belt with three large pouches for holding copper, silver, and gold pieces). Payment for drinks goes directly into these pouches; tips are placed in a large mug beneath the bar. The back wall of the bar has a spider web pattern etched into it, and in the very center of this web is a small shelf. Upon the shelf is a glass case containing a grapefruit-sized statuette of a spider which appears to be made of diamond.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Bartenders can enter and leave the bar through a hinged section at the west end; they can fetch supplies and bar snacks from the storage room (B) as needed. Various cudgels, blackjacks, and bung starters under the bar can be used by the bartenders during a brawl.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">B. Storage Room. (10' x 15') This is a "dry" storage room, containing bar supplies, hard liquor, mugs, bar snacks, etc. It is locked1 during business hours.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">C. Men's Privy. (10' x 15') A number of curtained stalls line the west wall, and a long trough stands against the east wall and south walls. Three barred windows in the east wall provide ventilation.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">D. Party Room. (10' x 20') This is a private room for special parties. It contains a large table and many chairs which can be rearranged any way the client wishes. If the room is not in use, the door is kept locked1. The party room must be reserved in advance through The Diamond Spider's proprietor.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">E. Dagger Boards, (15'x 30' area, divided into 6 "lanes"). This is where the popular dagger pitching games are held. Wood partitions separate each "lane". At the south end of each "lane" is a 6' high "target". The target boards are changed as necessary. No axes, spears, and so forth are allowed! Hanging lanterns light the targets.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">F. Women's Privy. (10' x 15') Similar to the men's privy (C), except there is no trough - just stalls along the west wall.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">G. Entertainment Area. (10' x 15') This is merely an open, raised area of floor where the various performers do their thing. Contests are also held here at times.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">H. Semi-Private Booths. These consist of padded wooden benches joined at a right angle, and a table. They are not screened by curtains. Candles provide light.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I. Private Booths. Each consists of 3 joined, padded wooden benches around a table and a beaded curtain across the front. They hold a good number of patrons and are ideal for intrigue. Candles provide light.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Personalities</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Spider Braz. Human. Ht: 5'9". Wt: 165 Ibs. Age: 41. Fighting prowess: excellent when throwing a dagger; otherwise very good.</p>

<p>
	<IMG SRC="../../../common/npc_images/SpiderBraz.jpg">
</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Spider is the sole owner and proprietor of the tavern. He has beady dark eyes, curly black hair that he wears in long ringlets, a Mandarin-style moustache, and an intricate spider tattoo on his left cheek. He is shady-looking in the extreme, and very quick, cunning, and lucky. He prefers daggers as weapons, but sometimes carries a short sword as well. He usually wears finely-crafted leather armor.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Spider was your basic, two-bit rogue until the day he joined a party of adventurers seeking the fabled "Diamond Spider". This valuable artifact was located in the Temple of Ishra, Demon-Queen of the Spiders, and Braz was the only survivor of the expedition (mainly due to his ability to hide). Spider, of course, claims he went toe-to-toe with Ishra herself to grab the artifact. The Spider Statuette in the Bar area is only a paste imitation, though Spider claims it is the real thing (which he chopped up long ago to pay for the tavern). Braz considers spiders lucky and smashing one in his presence is a definite faux pas.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">True to his nickname (the only name anyone knows him by), Spider has a hand in most of the illegal dealings in the City. As befits a tavern-keeper, he is very friendly and is around most of the time. He never tends bar, but he does judge contests, announce entertainers, and oversee the general operation of the tavern.</p>

<p class="regtxt9"><a href="../../npcs/kayara.htm">Vishina</a>. (The Dancer) Ancient. Ht: 5'7". Wt: 130 Ibs. Age: ?. Fighting prowess: Extreme.</p>

<p class="regtxt12"><a href="../../npcs/kayara.htm">Vishina</a>, also known as <a href="../../npcs/kayara.htm">"The Steel Gazelle"</a>, is the most popular dancer at The Diamond Spider. This sloe-eyed, willowy, tawny-blonde beauty has caused more men's deaths than the plague. Her haughty manner and total contempt for the male gender is a vast contrast to the abandoned sensuality of her various dance numbers, hence her odd nickname. She dances three times a night, twice a week; when she dances, the tavern is always packed to the rafters. Spider lusts after her, to no avail, and she can twist him around her little finger.</p>

<p class="regtxt12"><a href="../../npcs/kayara.htm">Vishina</a> is an incarnation of <a href="../../npcs/kayara.htm">Kayara</a>. She dances at the tavern to gather info, spread rumors, and in general engage in her trickster tactics. She plays at being the lover of <a href="../../npcs/rystya.htm">Rystya</a>, captain of the <a href="../../npcs/riverwind.htm">River Wind</a> (pre Valen and crew), <a href="../../npcs/riverdrake.htm">River Arrow</a> for Madison.</p>

<p class="regtxt12"><a href="../../npcs/kayara.htm">Vishina</a> wears two rings. One ring has a small needle tipped with a substance called Skintwister which causes anyone injected to have violent convulsions for about five minutes. The other ring contains a powdered poison called Black Rapture which is lethal within 30 seconds of its ingestion. She will use the first ring on someone who playfully molests her; she reserves the second ring for the truly crude types. She also wears a long comb in her hair which she can use as a weapon.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Mondrin Delain. Human. Ht: 5'6". wt: 150 lbs.
Age: 46. Fighting prowess: poor.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Mondrin is a short, grizzled man with a powerful, resonant voice and a compelling manner. He is something of a scholar, and has travelled much. He loves ancient legends and contemporary sagas in equal measure and is always on the lockout for new material for his stories.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Mondrin is the tavern storyteller. He secured the job by a stirring rendition of "The Ballad of The Diamond Spider", elaborating greatly on Spider Braz's recounting and of course making the tavern-keeper the central figure.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Mondrin is the only man who can drink more "Spider's Webs" than Spider himself. He is a great source of legendary information (for a price) and will even compose a story on the spot for an interested character (again, for a price). Mondrin is forced to recount "The Ballad of the Diamond Spider" once a week; otherwise, his repertoire varies widely. Mondrin is very popular. When he tells a story, the tavern becomes quiet and any boisterous activity is quickly stifled by bouncers.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Tavern Workers</p>

<p class="regtxt12">There are some 15 serving girls, a variety of bartenders and bouncers, and a basic clean-up crew. Personalize such employees as you see fit. Remember, the Tavern can be a rough place, so make the bartenders and bouncers fairly tough in a fight (fair to very good).</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Patrons</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Again, this is up to the GM. You can figure 3 - 18 patrons at slow hours, and a minimum of 25 when things are livelier.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scenario Suggestions</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Scenario 1</p>

<p class="regtxt12">A Priest of the Spider-Devil hires the characters to steal the Diamond Spider Statuette from the Tavern. The adventurers may or may not know the true nature of their employer. Its a safe bet that when the statuette turns out to be a fake, the party will be in hot water from more than one source.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Scenario 2</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Tragedy has struck The Diamond Spider's dagger-pitching team. Their best man has been run over by a dung wagon and cannot participate (Spider suspects it might not have been an accident). A big match with a team from the Golden Troll tavern is scheduled, and much money is riding on the outcome. The best dagger thrower in the party is invited to join the team. If he or she declines, then the boys from the Spider are going to be very angry. If he or she accepts, the Big Gambler who had the guy run over by the dung wagon to hedge his bet is going to try and arrange a similar accident for the character. People tend to take their dagger-pitching very seriously in the City.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Scenario 3</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Spider has heard rumors that Vishina has taken a lover. Jealousy prompts him to hire adventurers to track down this rival for his affections and remove them. If Vishina becomes aware of this she will have great fun playing the adventurers and Spider..</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Scenario 4</p>

<p class="regtxt12">When Ishra is captured by Aztol she begins to send images to the various temples that were her centers of power. These usually infiltrate the dreams of the priesthood, however, since Spider had intimate contact with one of her items, he is also a recipient. Since he is not a priest, this takes longer to bleed into his conscious mind. Now that it has Spider has been getting vague nightmares about a trapped woman. He isn't sure what she looks like or where she is held, just formless nightmares of torture and pain. He might hire adventurers with dream interpretation skills to help him. If he can figure out more of what is happening he might hire adventurers to rescue the lady of the dreams.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Obviously, many scenarios can be derived from a night in The Diamond Spider. Mondrin the Storyteller makes an excellent device for alerting players to the next quest in the GM's campaign (or even for sending them off on a monster-filled wild goose chase). Vishina is an excellent foil for the macho types in the party, and Spider himself can get players in all types of trouble. Characters can even have a good time merely sampling the various games offered (try an actual howling contest, but alert your neighbors FIRST!), getting in brawls, or making wagers. Taverns are a mainstay of fantasy gaming, and this one should fulfill your needs admirably.</p>
