<p class="pagecaption">Failed Mage Tavern</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This tavern is near <a href="misk_u.htm">Miskatonic University</a>, the School of Majik, located in Miskaton. Sharyl runs it and is found there whenever she needs to take a break from her role as headmistress of the school. This has become fairly often. Now she retains control of the school, but has turned over most of the day to day stuff to the board of deans. She disguises herself as a non-descript, dark haired woman of middle years when visible to the student clientel. To those in the know, she has a <a href="../../info/carnival.htm">T'Sani</a> look about her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is a school tavern, with all the attendant hijinks and testosterone poisoning. Majik duels are called, pranks are pulled, and far too much alcohol and other intoxicants consumed. This keeps the staff and bouncers quite busy at all hours.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are several rooms for rent upstairs. Some are rented for the school year to students and a few are kept as nightly rentals for those too drunk to head home or for the odd visitor. The rooms are spartan, but neat and clean.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a private link to the school and another one to the sewers. These entrances are known only to the staff and a few trusted acquaintences.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Arkhelice Froy was a friend of Yashyra (<a href="../../npcs/sharyl.htm">Sharyl</a>) and arranged with her to leave some of her effects in the private tunnel to the sewers. Pagaret Tazotra will recieve an item in the packet of stuff her sister found that Yashyra will recognize.</p>
