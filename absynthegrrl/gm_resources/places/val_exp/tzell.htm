<p class="regtxt5">Minstrel of Dawn - Danilithor Tyazen - ghost - loved Karyn one of the emperor’s twin daughters, the one who became the Shade. He can feel she is still alive and will not die until knows what has happened with her. He seeks to find her. He fled Loncath from wrath of emperor Sarnath when his other twin daughter was made into ship. He knew secret of sultan, that he had the key to release of lizardmen wizards from prison in mountains north of Lotus empire. He knows where key is and how to use it. He was killed by hired brigands that were sent by those who "killed" the girl. He doesn't know what happened to Karyn. The brigands thought he had moon stones, or knew where they were. At the time he didn’t even know what they were, much less what they might be used for. He dreams of five tear shaped diamonds needed to free Karyn which are the Moon Stones everyone was after.</p>
