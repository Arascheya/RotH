<p class="pagecaption">Miskatonic University</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Miskatonic University is the School of Majik, located in <a href="miskaton.htm">Miskaton</a>, in the <a href="val_exp_inx.htm">Valley of Exper</a>. It is a multi-verse renowned school, attended by the cream of the <a href="../../info/arcanes/arcane_inx.htm">arcane</a> crop from everywhere that majik is practiced.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a World Gate link in the basement of the headmistress house to allow students from other realms to attend the school. It is a general purpose Gate, meaning, each student arriving through the Gate is majikally and technologically identified and tagged so the Gate will return them only to their point of origin, not to any other realm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Data packets are available on any world that acknowledges access to Centrys, and on some that do not through more shady means.</p>

All serious students are invited to talk to our placement and recruiting councilors. Our primary offices are located on the Street of Dark Blades, Mistress Ward, Centrys.
