<p class="pagecaption">Azkelon</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Azkelon is another old city. There are tunnels and sewers underneath, forming a web of connections between the various cells of the city.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The sewers and under-tunnels are the home to the poorer section of the populace. Ever since the Merchanters Council started cleaning up the streets a couple of generations ago, the beggars, homeless, and extremely poor moved into the under areas. Taking over ruined cellars and tunnels to create small enclaves scattered under the city. Some areas are reasonably safe, others are pretty rough and wild. Travel through the under-tunnels can be somewhat hazzardous if the traveller is unaware of the various zones.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Officially there are supposed to be no tunnel connections between the various city cells, however, the reality is, some cells have to connect to others to get to the lake. Many cross-connects exist and are only shut down if something note-worthy brings a connection to the attention of the Merchanters.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The under-tunnels are left from quarries where some of the building materials were gathered for early city building. Others are abandoned cellars and storage areas left behind when the city was expanded and rebuilt after fires or attacks. The under-tunnels house the poor, the thieves, and other undesirables moved out of the upper city by the various Merchanter forces. Some areas are relatively peaceful, others are more chaotic. Most inhabitants try to settle in the peaceful areas. There is a large underground market, considered nuetral territory, near the center of the under-tunnel warrens. Here anything can be bought or sold.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is one of Elentaryn's monitoring stations and old Sphynx path clues located in the under-tunnels and the center of several city walls. A shaft goes up to the Azkelon monitoring station and branches to various buildings in the city. This shaft also drops to a ring door to the tube train station for the Sphynx Path. There is a coridor up to the basement of a tavern where the sphynx is located. It is in a secret room that hasn't been accessed since the Hell Gate Wars. The people that knew about this room died in the wars.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Azkelon was originally founded by the Azkel family when the valley was first being settled. The Azkel  family was among a group of noble families that fled Pavis during a bloody fight for control of the city and surroundings. They fled through the Ancient’s Way and stopped on reaching the valley. There, they maried to Tolaz clan and produced the family that rules Azkelon for many years.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">(<A href="../../npcs/aztol.htm">Aztol</a> is no relation to this family, although he is pretending to it)</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../npcs/kier_collis.htm">Collis</a> is recently come into the merchanters group from the marriage to Hazel Woodson’s daughter. He has inherited control of Nightshade Shipping on the death of Woodson.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is intrigue (always) about who has how much control in the merchanter council. Collis has not been as successful at climbing the ranks as he had hoped yet...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Adventurers Life - now run by <a href="../../npcs/oriana.htm">Oriana Web</a> is another up coming business venture in the on-going mix of businesses in Azkelon</p>
