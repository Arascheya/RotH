<p class="pagecaption">Valley of the Experiment - Basic Data</p>
<p class="regtxt5">insular, fairly high majik</p>
<p class="regtxt5">two large cities</p>
<p class="regtxt5">several medium</p>
<p class="regtxt5">many small towns and villages</p>
<p class="regtxt5">self sufficient</p>
<p class="regtxt5">some trade east and west with more to the west - some caravans will go all the way to the Isle of Research - /* need to place on maps and calculate distances */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">trading ships are predominantly valley personel</p>
<p class="regtxt5">their arcanes are not necessarily aware of the hostility they will receive if they leave the valley</p>
<p class="regtxt5">valley area is divided into 8 fiefdoms/merchant family holdings</p>
<p class="regtxt5">(map notes - I think)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">1 - capital - <a href="azkelon.htm">Azkelon</a>; main trade by river - modify Skald map for this town</p>

<p class="regtxt5">E - major earth node at arcane school - inner meditaion and practice areas</p>
<p class="regtxt5">F - bear tribes area</p>
<p class="regtxt5">valley was originally controled by a major noble family that was finally overthrown and driven out by the merchant families and the private armies they had recruited on the sly. This family was destroyed about 14 years ago, about the time of kaltereth’s disappearance. Aztol weakened the noble families when they opposed his search for kaltereth.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Experiment Valley</p>
<p class="regtxt5">smugglers - produce Extaze, gort, tartella, and other drugs in Azkelon and Tzell, ship it by river trade and use the Ancient’s Way to distribute it beyond the valley, the majority ships back toward the high valley and the shade’s domain, small quantities toward hornsgate, collis is highly involved, other goods include slaves, metal hardener, tech. The raw materials come from various places around the valley and must be moved quietly</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Zatol (Aztol) - for new group can use Zatol - looking for Krystyl and set back up in old noble holdings, he brought his own set of flunkies/toadies to install in the local bureaucracy, he is also searching for clues to Kaltereth’s tower. Beginning takeover from the northern areas and migrating south. Has taken an abandoned noble holding and claimed it as his ancestral home.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He has forced the River Wind to migrate a bit farther south to avoid his power block. At this point they will venture as far north as Azkelon. He has spies out trying to locate krystyl. He believes she is somewhere in the area.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">7 merchant families - one for each major political region</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1 - Dinguld - high taxes, repressive, strong secret police structure</p>
<p class="regtxt12">leader - arrogant, rude, power comes from money, influence, and terror, uses secret police against any opponent</p>
<p class="regtxt12">family - several daughters, only one son/heir, the others died (usually with help from remaining son)</p>
<p class="regtxt9">2 - Wildhavens - tribesmen, hunter/gatherers, matriarchal trade animal products for other goods/services, wary of city/town dwellers - group contains some shifters</p>
<p class="regtxt12">leader - strong, no nonsense but practical, can compromise if necessary, secure - can retreat into the wilds and fight a guerrilla action for as long as necessary, leader is elected by the clans, recognizes the usefulness of magic and encourages it’s learning</p>
<p class="regtxt12">people - respect strength and ability, words considered secondary to actions</p>
</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">scene ideas:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">tavern brawl where main characters recover a message tube or overhear a conversation involving smuggling and the setting up of the River Wind for her to take the fall for it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A temple is sacrificing virgins in the hope of at least partially reopening one of the hell gates - or attempt to create a new one.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">(used with Verkal) key to Kaltereth’s Tower given to a character by a man dying of massive burns, saying, "this is for you now, my son/daughter", on attunement will activate a low level geas primarily generating images of the tower and a vast longing to go there, will also provide a protect 2 spell 3 times per day</p>
<p class="regtxt5">deck of z tarot cars somewhere in a treasure - vibes are playful and well used.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Place an abandoned keep in one of the wilder areas that contains a possessor breeding facility in the lower dungeons. It shows signs of a recent battle and then abandonment. Bredding equipment includes solution tanks, pumps, heaters, power cells, and cells to hold new hosts.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ancient’s Way</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ancient’s Way - a segment of the tube train system that is now used to trade from the high valley to the Lotus Empire, High Valley, and the Isle of Research. It has entry points near the hidden valley side of the valley and near the west side. it is depressurized and open at several points, it is kept minimally clean and way stations have been carved into it in places where the old escape hatches were placed, it is somewhat maintained by the caravans that use it and the way station operators that depend on it for livelihood.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">One of the access ways leads to the high mountain where the frozen monastery is located. It is here that the hut people will enter, unless they get the hut figured out. If they activate the gate controller inside the hut they will transport themselves and it to the Z equivalent location, plus getting all kinds of warnings about dangerous feedback and resonances from the interaction of the two fields. It will cause them massive amounts of pain since it will really mess with the hut control systems.
Route - isle of research, hi valley, small cryo - Man's Birth Caverns between secret valley and high valley (need to place ancient sites nearby that would justify cryo site), valley of experiment</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Traders sometimes advertise for caravan guards in Dinguld and Odarkar</p>
<p class="regtxt5">cults - maintain power with merchanters and newer nobility, continue trying to increase their membership and influence.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Arcanes - maintain power balance in the face of rising cult popularity, they wish the return to power of the old noble families.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Smugglers - maintain operations and working environment, worried by merchanter buildup that is occuring to fight the returning nobility</p>
<p class="regtxt5">River Wind - was River Arrow - sold to Kara and company by Rystya. They now run it and are somewhat content with the arrangement. It is almost close enough to Ghost Wind for Kara to be happy. They are now having to dodge Aztol. Somehow he has gotten the idea that Shandi and Krys are in the area. Collis will be trying to aquire a handle on the River Wind so he can use her reputation to conceal his smuggled goods.</p>
