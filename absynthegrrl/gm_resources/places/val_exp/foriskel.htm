<p class="regtxt5">Foriskel - Population 1200</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aztol’s crew is infiltrating here, ostensibly they are preparing the way for the new noble regime, mostly they are looking for Krys. Aztol is convinced she knows the whereabouts of the Cobra Book.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The merchanter police are attempting to keep track of Aztol’s forces and maintain control, they will go to great lengths to prevent shifts in the current power structure.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Foriskel is the northern end of the river road. It is where goods are loaded onto caravans that will take them through the ancients ways to pavis or toward the isle of research.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Contains Flatulent Fairy, a rowdy soldiers tavern in the dock sections of town</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The talk of the town is zatol and his power plays in delgakar and guldurak, gentle probings will reveal he is working his way into the overseer’s government and will probably grab control in the next few months.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Militia - city guards - maintain peace, handle most normal crime situations</p>
<p class="regtxt5">temples - spies everywhere to ferret out any threat to them and their power, they are actively opposing the return to power of the noble families and the continued acceptance of Arcanes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Arcanes - they are attempting to maintain/increase their power and undermine the temples, they are also trying to assist the return to power of the old noble families.</p>
