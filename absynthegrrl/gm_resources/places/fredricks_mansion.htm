<p class="pagecaption">Fredricks Mansion</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Fredricks Mansion dates from the 1880's logging boom in the area. The Fredricks family owned one of the larger ones. The family scattered a bit in the early 1900s, so a fraction of the family remained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ian Fredricks was a member of the <a href="../info/gate_mons.htm">Monitors</a>, those charged with hiding and securing the <a href="../info/hellgate_navsys.htm">Hell</a> and <a href="../info/wrldgate_navsys.htm">World</a> <a href="../gates_inx.htm">Gates</a>. His team was killed in the 1920s and the location of their secret store of information and tools was lost. There is a room off the emergency tunnel where the Monitors met and kept their tools. This is well-hidden and is not found until Dan and his friends are exloring. They find a secret passage  from the old house to the out-building where Dan's family lives while fixing up the main house. Lara finds the hidden entrance to a room along the passage that holds the old monitor's documents. This should be after Cindy's death.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Fredricks estate lands have been split into two segements. The smaller segment has been retained by the family for house-hold use. The larger section has been placed into a trust and shared with the city as Fredricks Park. It is held in trust, administered by the Fredricks family and open to the city for recreational uses. The city maintains the lands and a shelter, but has to check with the trustees for any changes in use or structures on the land. In return, the trustees must provide a percentage of the upkeep costs to the city.</p>
