<p class="pagecaption">Free Islands Alliance</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is the area your adventurers have come from. Each island is ruled by its own group of nobles and officials. Most of the islands trade with each other, with shipments periodically intercepted by different pirate bands. Many of these pirates operate from bases in the southern end of the island chain. There is also some trade with the Lotus Empire, primarily spices for luxury items. Trade has increased slightly over the past few zyrodyls (years).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Free Islands extend south from the coast of the Lotus Empire. It is a far away and exotic location that you know little about. Listed below are the major islands about which you know something:</p>



<p class="regtxt9">HEBRIDAE- small, isolated farming communities with mostly human inhabitants with a few dwarves. This island has no large port cities and is mostly self sufficient with little outside trade or influence.</p>



<p class="regtxt9">HILDAK- rich seafood catches and several large port cities. This island exports several varieties of exotic fish and shellfish. Population consists of humans and hobbits.</p>



<p class="regtxt9">KHAALDA- relatively poor, noted only for a large gnome population.</p>


<p class="regtxt9">END REACH- very near pirate controlled waters with few fishing or sea ports. Pirate raids are very frequent in all coastal villages. Most of the population grows spices or sheep and goats in the upland fields. Some spices and goods are traded by adventurous ship captains.</p>



<p class="regtxt9">FAR REACH - your home and even farther out than End Reach. - one of the last inhabited islands in the Free Island chain. This is mostly a farming/herding island with a small population who settled here to get away from the complications and crowding of the more populous islands. They keep mostly to themselves, desiring to be left alone.</p>



<p class="regtxt9">LOTHLINEAL- mountainous and heavily forested. This island trades many elvish goods and its population is mostly elven and half-elven.</p>



<p class="regtxt9">RICH SPICE- even further into pirate waters than End Reach this island is the richest spice producing island in the area. Its spices are valued throughout the Free Islands, the Lotus Empire, and beyond. Trade however is very risky with many different groups keeping close watch on all trade.</p>



<p class="regtxt9">PIRATESHOLD- an island in the southern reaches of the island chain, its exact location is known only to many of the pirate bands. It is thought to be rich with pirate treasure and plunder but garrisoned by many relaxing and resting pirate crews.</p>



<p class="regtxt9">BEODELLE- (Snob's Reach) - another forested island with most land belonging to nobles residing on Dierlund. Trespassing by non-nobles is punished in any way the current inhabitants find fit.</p>



<p class="regtxt9">DIERLUND- this island is the largest and richest in the Free Islands. It has several large forests of precious woods, large tracts of arable land and several rich gem mines. This island has large non-human populations including a large dwarven community living in the gem mines.</p>



<p class="regtxt5">Skellit’s Hoard - an unlabelled island to the east of Pirateshold. This island contains the Ocean-Continent Tube Train Interface for this section of the world. It also contains Skellit’s last main hoard. This was hidden by Cpn Robin Skellit shortly before the battle for Pirateshold in which he was killed. The few of his crew who knew of this location also died in the fight. So far no one has landed here to find it. This is mostly a rocky up thrust from the sea floor. There is a narrow cove with a steep slope up to the main areas of the island. The rest of the coast is steep cliffs straight down to the water. The OCTTI facility contains a core tap power station, repair facilities, force drill, and other miscellaneous necessary for repair and rescue activities. Currently the main under-ocean tubes here are flooded from a break 40 zeems out to sea. The tubes to the mainland are dry and pass near the Machine Ruins on their way to the Man’s Birth Caverns and the cryo site near the Lotus Empire.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">OCTTI - has stone emergency stairwell up - this is the entrance to Raisilian’s holding. There is a perpetual stair effect in the area created by a teleport spell. In this section is a grouping of skeletons leaning against the wall. Passing a certain point teleports the character back up a ways. Just before the teleport is the secret door into Raisilian’s holding.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Inside the holding there is a sitting room, living sections, kitchen, and research areas. From the living sections there is an exit that leads out just below the teleport. If the characters walk up the stairs they will reach the surface. If they turn around and walk back down they are once more caught in the teleport. The teleport only allows escape if the characters are walking up from below the lower teleport point. If they turn around while caught in the loop they will be teleported back to the bottom of the loop section and remain trapped.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Skellit had a priest set up a couple of guardian spirits in the entry section of the holding. These will attack any who are not Skellit or the priest. Raisilian has set up his own tricks and traps throughout his holding with most of them in the research and majik sections.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Raisilian was experimenting with something in his lab that got away from him. The door is closed with a skeletal hand outside it. On one finger is a re-tunable Thought Crystal Ring. This ring is how he managed to get the section from his holding to the Machine Ruins working. This ring will allow the characters access to the tech sections of the OCTTI located in the depths of the island.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is a door from Raisilian’s work areas that leads to the main platform. An Egg of the Ancients rests there, awaiting passengers. On a scrap of paper tied to the chair nearest the control panel are the codes for the Machine Ruins and the OCTTI. Activating the Egg will cause the fan system to activate and then the Egg to seal and move. The tunnels are damaged beyond the Machine Ruins and are sealed off.
The tunnels under the ocean are in working order but have been sealed by Elentaryn. This can be opened with an as yet to be determined key. Could be something as simple as a place that adds the access codes to the Though Crystal Ring.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Skellit’s horde - should be moderate in size. Most of Raisilian’s items were taken by Skellit and his priest. Not certain why they missed the ring.</p>
