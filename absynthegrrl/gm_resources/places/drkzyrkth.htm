<p class="regtxt5">Dead world that was the home world of the <a href="../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a>. It is designed around a circular premise. Cities are built in concentric circles from the central sections. There is no history currently known about this world. Few have visited it and few even know of it. Iskandera came across it through research in Centrys.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The accidental release of vampyrites and other not-quite-ready nanotrech decimated this world. Nothing lives there now.</p>
