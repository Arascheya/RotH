<p class="pagecaption">Chapel of Silence</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">RotH specifics</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The chapel is built near the edge of a cliff. The underground areas below it were hollowed out from the stone of the cliff. In some areas the remaining stone wall is so thin that it has broken, or has been broken, through to the outside.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Chapel of Silence was built several centuries ago by Baron Owen the Even-Handed to celebrate his marriage to the lovely Lady Andrea. This noble pair ruled long and well over their little barony. Their reign was, in fact, so benign and prosperous that both were revered as saints during their lives. During that era the Chapel was furnished with beauty and elegance. Burial in its crypts was considered the ultimate honor and was thought to insure an afterlife of eternal bliss.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In due course Owen died of old age, and the grieving Andrea outlived him by only two days. They were entombed in the chapel which Owen raised in gratitude for and tribute to his lovely bride. After their deaths, Owen and Andrea were remembered and worshiped along with the benign gods to whom the chapel was originally dedicated. Eventually, the cult which worshiped the baron and his lady diminished in power but remained a pleasant memory among the people of the barony.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In recent years the cult of Owen and Andrea has been revived in a sinister guise. Following an earthquake which breached the cliff on which the chapel stands, a vampire priest of he Dark God moved into the lower reaches of the tower, taking over the crypts where the good were buried and converting the burial vaults to his own evil purpose.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The vampire has gained the acceptance of the people by pretending to worship Owen and Andrea. To this end he has transported their miraculously preserved bodies from their tombs and enthroned them in the lowest level of their chapel, there to "rule" over the skeletal bodies of his victims.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The priest has gradually stripped the chapel of its beauty and hidden the lovely and valuable treasures that used to be part of the worship services.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The true gods of the chapel, devoted to the cause of good,
have contrived to keep the upper portion of the chapel relatively
free from sacrilege— but only relatively free, since the Dark God
continually attempts to wrest more space and power from the
good gods, while at the same time the forces of good keep trying
to cleanse their chapel. Thus, few areas of the chapel can be said
to be wholly good or wholly evil since each force infiltrates the
other’s territory. The spirits of Andrea and Owen look on in
restless misery, desiring only the comfort of oblivion. Andrea
begs travelers for her rescue, but Owen does not wish additional
deaths to be suffered on his behalf.
Background for players
Your party is on a journey through a mountainous region
distinguished by sheer cliffs and dangerous precipices. Thus
everyone is quite grateful when, just at nightfall, they find a
small abandoned chapel. It provides a dry shelter from the wind
and radiates such an aura of good that there is no hesitation
about sheltering within it.
It is a relatively small room, hexagonal in shape with a central
altar. It is impossible to determine the deity who was served
here, since the chapel has been vandalized. Visible among the
wreckage are the remains of a few benches and two stone
tombs. Even the tombs have been desecrated, so that the sleep-
ing statues of an ancient lord and his fair lady preside over
obviously empty sepulchers.
During the night each member of the party has a dream.
Note to the DM: Following is an accurate description of the
important facts of the dream which is designed to help inspire
the party members to succeed in their quest. It is possible that
not every adventurer will have exactly the same dream, and
some of the party members may not have such a dream at all.
The DM is encouraged to use judgement in moderating the
dream and its after-effects to best suit the abilities and charac-
teristics of the players and their characters.
The dream:
The chapel seems filled with light and a happy throng of
people, and it is apparent that a wedding is in progress. Just as
the priest pronounces his final blessing upon the betrothed pair,
the scene fades. A new scene follows it — a scene as sorrowful
as its predecessor was joyful. Again the chapel is full of people,
but this time all are weeping. A funeral procession escorts two
shrouded bodies to their tombs and tearfully places them within.
Once again the priest pronounces a final blessing and the scene
fades.
A third scene follows; again the chapel is full of light. The
adventurers themselves are the only ones in attendance, but
suddenly they are struck dumb with surprise as the figure of a
lovely woman appears at the altar. Silently she beckons to the
party, and each member senses her promise that person (the
one who is having the particular dream) boundless reward if he
will but follow her. Just as that character steps forward, there is a
blinding flash and a stalwart man suddenly stands beside the
lady with a sword in his hand. While the lady begins to weep
entreatingly, the man steps to prevent anyone from approach-
ing her. He sadly shakes his head in refusal of the lady’s pleas.
The scene then gradually fades, and each character awakens.
In the gray light of dawn, the party rises somberly and breaks
its fast upon rations from the packs. Finally, one member breaks
the silence and speaks of his strange dream. A discussion fol-
lows during which everyone relates his or her dream and the
members decide to further investigate the chapel.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">LEVEL 1
A careful search of the chapel will reveal that the altar slides
easily to one side, revealing a spiral staircase curving down into
the dark. The stairs wind around a central column and eventual-
ly emerge in the center of a large shadowy room.
This room, like all other rooms below the level of the chapel
itself, has been carved out of the cliff rock. The floor is smooth
stone. On this level the ceiling is very high, impossible to see
from the floor by lantern or torchlight.
The room is roughly hexagonal with six large open chambers
around the perimeter. The stone walls have been dressed very
smooth and covered with plaster. Along the back wall of each
niche is a large picture painted on the wall itself. The pictures
are positioned rather high on the walls, so that they cannot be
closely inspected without raising a torch or lantern high over-
head and approaching to within about 15 feet of the wall.
When the light strikes the eyes of one or more beings depicted
in a certain painting, all beings in the picture will be animated
and will come out fighting. They will all attack the party (except
in the case of Picture 3), doing and taking normal damage. When
a painted creature loses half its hit points it will vanish from the
battle and reappear as part of the picture again. If the picture is
darkened and lighted again, the creature(s) will emerge once
more with hit points restored to maximum (except for Picture 3).
The subjects of the pictures are:
1. The tower as it was first built, revealing to the charac-
ters that it stands at the top of a tall, sheer cliff.
2. An ogre: Armor Class: 6 Move per turn: 90’ Attacks

As the party exits the bottom of the
stairs, they will be facing the wall con-
taining Picture 1.
The armored man in Picture 3 is Law-
ful Good and if not attacked by the party
will join it after the goblins are defeated.
He will, fight very bravely, actively seek-
ing the forefront of the battle. When he
has lost half his hit points he will disap-
pear and reappear in his picture, whence
he can be reactivated by a clever charac-
ter. He cannot speak and is illiterate but
is quite good at communicating by signs.
A careful examination of the area will
reveal the following words engraved in
ancient common around the perimeter
of the floor at the entrances to the
chambers. Numbers correspond to the
location of the floor section bearing
those words.
1: CLEAN AGAlN WHEN THE LlGHT OF
2: LIFE COMES TO LIFELESS EYES
3: AND MORTAL SWORD SLAYS
FLESH
4: IMMORTAL THEN WILL THE DUMB
SPEAK
5: THE DEAD DIE THE DARK GOD TOPPLE
6: AND THE CHAPEL OF SILENCE BE
Commas help prophecies immensely. Properly punctuated
and ordered, this one reads, “When the light of life comes to
lifeless eyes, and mortal sword slays flesh immortal; then will the
dumb speak, the dead die, the dark god topple, and the Chapel
of Silence be clean again.”
If a character looks for another prophecy on the ceiling, he
will only succeed in reanimating one or more pictures.
A thorough search of the entire floor will eventually reveal a
trap door directly at the bottom of the stairs where the party
entered. Another circular stair leads further down.
LEVEL 2
The second flight of stairs is much shorter than the first,
indicating a much lower ceiling (about 10’ in height). On this
level the stone walls are smoothly dressed but not plastered.
Partition walls are stone masonry. Doors are wooden, very
heavy, and open inward. They are metal-bound and have metal
hardware. All floors are smooth stone except for that of the
center room.
ROOM 2-0: The flight of stairs exits from the inside of a
hexagonal column in the center of a hexagonal room. The room
is 20’ on a side with a door in the center of each of the six walls.
The floor here is dark and glass-like with no visible seams,
The party emerges from the stairway facing the door to Room
2-1. At their feet are several inanimate human skeletons.
Examination of the skeletons will show that there were at least
nine bodies, since parts of nine different skulls can be identified.
There is no treasure, and what remains of the arms and armor of
the skeletons has deteriorated beyond use.
The floor is so slippery that each character has one chance in
six of falling the first time he attempts to walk across it, and one
chance in four if he tries to run.

PERIMETER ROOMS: All perimeter rooms are basically the
same. Each contains an altar and three kneeling benches uphol-
stered in velvet. The three walls of each room furthest from the
door are draped with velvet. Before each drape stands a skelet-
on with its hands in an attitude of prayer. (The skeletons do not
animate if handled gently and respectfully.) Behind the center
drape is a smooth wall with no visible masonry joints. It seems to
be plastered and is painted a dull white. It is actually a sliding
panel and will move (when proper pressure is applied) 5’ to the
right, revealing a triangular secret room.
The details of the perimeter rooms and the secret rooms are as
follows:
ROOM 2-1: The velvet is deep red. The altar is engraved with
scenes of battle and the skeletons are wearing armor.
ROOM 2-11: As soon as the door is fully open, a bolt is
released from a crossbow in the apex of the triangle. If it hits it
will do 1-6 points of damage.
A thick layer of dust covers the floor and the articles thereon.
The room contains several pieces of armor which look more
ceremonial than useful. Two items of evident value are a je-
welled helmet and a sword with a golden hilt. (Estimated value:
20gp each) The rest is obviously of little value and less useful-
ness. At the very back of the room there is a long bundle
wrapped in a soldier’s cloak. It contains a very plain, simply
crafted sword of excellently forged metal in mint condition.
ROOM 2-2: The draperies and upholstery are dull gold. The
altar engraving shows scenes of commerce. The skeletons wear
three-piece garments of conservative cut.
ROOM 2-21: When the secret door is opened, a pit taking up
the entire floor area of the room is revealed. The sides are
smooth and sheer. A character who falls into the pit will be lost
without a trace.
ROOM 2-3: Hangings and upholstery are rich green. The altar
has hunting scenes; the skeletons are attired as hunters.
ROOM 2-31:  The secret room contains ancient, moth-eaten
hunting trophies. The dust in the room bears evidence of recent
traffic. There is a small ivory hunting horn hanging high over the
door in semi-darkness. The party will notice it on a roll of 1 or 2
on d6, or if anyone specifically states that he is looking at the
wall over the door.
ROOM 2-4: In this room are two grave robbers armed with
swords. They will be hiding behind the door when it is opened
and will then attempt to strike from behind.
Primo: AC 5 Move: 60’ Att: 1 Dam: 1-6 Dex: 14
HP: 12 HD:2.
Gundo: AC 5 Move: 60’ Att: 1 Dam: 1-6 Dex: 11
HP: 15 HD: 3.
Both bags together also contain four combs, three necklaces,
and a ruby bracelet. Gundo’s bag contains a gold ring set with
three large pearls. The total value of this haul is about 500gp,
excluding the ring. It is a Ring of Three Wishes.
The room is decorated in rich brown. The altar shows scenes
of planting and reaping, and the skeletons wear the attire of rich
peasants.
ROOM 2-41: A large bear trap (1-4) awaits the first unwary
foot across the entrance. The trap may be sprung with a pole or
similar implement.
The dust in this room is deep and undisturbed. In the center of
the room is a small table bearing a golden bowl heaped full of
grain. To the right of the table is a small golden scythe. To the
left is a miniature iron plow. The bowl and scythe are worth
about 100gp each.

<p class="regtxt5">ROOM  2-51:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">As the secret door slides open, a large swatch of dusty silk cascades into the room. A full-size silk sail has been stuffed loosely and carelessly into the room. The sail shows its age but is still reasonably strong. If it is all pulled out, the party will find a quantity of gilded rope in the northern corner. If that is moved off or across the floor, they will find a small but very elegant ship model. This is the <a href="../items/ship_ishtar.htm">Ship of Ishtar</a>. It is of ivory with silken sails and fine gold rigging. The robbers apparently overlooked it while wrestling with the sail and rope. Its value is hard to assess because of its obviously great artistic merit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">ROOM 2-6: All the cloth in this room is of a delicate rose-
colored hue. The skeletons are clothed in women’s robes and
the altar is carved with scenes of the home.
ROOM 2-61: The room has evidently been looted. There is a
broken clay pot within, and a churn lying on it side. In the churn
is a dirty scrap of paper which is actually a Scroll of Healing.
Deep in the dust in the corner is a small golden thimble.
There is a trap door in the floor which opens to reveal a flight
of stairs going down.
When the party attempts to leave this level, the skeletons from
the perimeter rooms will attack, either one after the other or
simultaneously, with each skeleton’s first attack always sur-
prising.
If the party is leaving by the trap door in Room 2-6, the
skeletons in that room will attack first with the others arriving as
reinforcements at the rate of three per round. They will not
follow the party down the stairs, and no other skeletons will
enter and fight if all skeletons present are killed at the end of any
round; however, those which don’t enter will instantly attack (no
automatic surprise) when someone re-enters the center room.

If the party attempts to retreat up the stairs back to the chapel,
they will find the altar has been moved back over the trap door,
and it is impossible to remove from below.
When all party members are on the descending stairs (which
appear very smooth and solid, the staircase will suddenly turn
into a slide and the party will arrive at the floor of the next level
tumbled into a heap. The character in the lead on the stairs will
take 1-3 points of damage from the slide and the collisions with
his followers.
LEVEL 3
The walls are rough-hewn stone and exhibit a large number of
cracks as a result of the earthquake some years ago. There are
heaps of stone and rubbish everywhere.
The rooms are hexagonal, following the same general pattern
as on Level 2. Most of the doors hang a bit crazily on their
hinges, although two are still wholly functional. The large rooms
on this level seem to have been intended as crypts, but no
corpses remain in sight.
The party lands at the bottom of the slide in Room 3-6.
ROOM 3-0:  There is nothing here but dust and rubble. The
outside of the central column is still intact but the stairway
inside has collapsed, filling the lower part of the column.
ROOM 3-1: The door to this room is intact and closed. When it
is opened, the party will see a clean, airy room with an opening
to the outside. There is a bed of sorts at one side, a catchbasin
for water, and a cooking area near the opening. A man in ragged
clerical robes sits with his back to the party looking out through
the area where Room 3-11 should be.
The man is Shar, the hermit. He subsists on the kindness of
the local people, lowering his basket on a long cord to receive
their donations. He cannot speak.
If the party offers gold or other valuables to Shar he will
smilingly refuse, but if any member shares his food with him,
Shar will silently bless that adventurer. The blessing of Shar is a
great gift, since it will heal each recipient to within two hit points
of original strength and give that character a +2 bonus on all
saving throws for the duration of the adventure.
If a character holding or carrying the steel sword (from Level
2) receives the blessing, the sword will be felt to leap in its
wrappings. Upon examination, it will be seen to display a soft,
magical glow. From this moment on it may be used as a +2 magic
sword.
If the party attacks Shar, the hermit will simply vanish to the
protection of the good gods until the threat is past, at which time
he will reappear in his chamber.
Shar’s cave is safe from all evil and can provide the party a
place to rest and recover. A magic-user can study his spell book
while sequestered here if he so desires.
Although Shar cannot speak, he can communicate effectively
by gestures, pictures, end written words, though his version of
the common tongue is archaic by the party members’ standards.
He will help the party in any way he can (once he is befriended)
but will refuse to go anywhere else in the complex with them.
Shar was the chief priest of the chapel in the days of Owen’s
life. He and Bran, Owen’s chief captain, have been called upon
by the gods to be the guards of the chapel. Shar came originally
from the foreground of the chapel picture on Level 1, where he
was “implanted” just like other images were in the other pic-
tures. However, Shar was able to remain out of the picture after
being released by light at a much earlier time, and thinks he can
better serve as a chapel guard by keeping watch over the breach
caused by the earthquake.
Bran is, of course, the armed man from another of the Level 1
pictures. Their attributes are as follows:
Shar: Cleric Lawful Good HP: 15 HD: 3 Str: 16
Int: 14 Wis: 18 Con: 13 Dex: 12 Cha: 15.
Bran: Fighter Lawful Good HP: 24 HD: 3 Str: 18
Int: 12 Wis: 12 Con: 18 Dex: 14 Cha: 15.
ROOM 3-11:  The ruins of this room form the “porch” of Shar’s
cave. The steepness and smoothness of the cliff sides will not
permit descent by this route. Shar will not cooperate in any plan
by the party to use this as an exit.
ROOM 3-2: This chamber is dimly lit in the daytime by light
which seeps in through several cracks in the exterior walls. It
contains a nest of four stirges. They will attack any character or
creature who enters, but will not pursue any intruder outside the
room. The door to this room is slightly out of kilter because of
the earthquake and does not close tightly.

ROOM  3-3:  The room is pitch dark, and the territory is jealous-
ly guarded by a wight. The wight can be hit only by magic
weapons. Its touch does no damage in hit points but drains away
life energy. When the wight scores a hit, its opponent will drop
one experience level, losing the appropriate number of hit
points. A character who loses all of his/her levels (down to zero)
becomes a wight under the control of the original wight.

If the battle begins to go too badly for the party, the spirit of
Owen will intervene. He will appear in a blaze of light, defeat the

utter a strange cry. Suddenly, the party member with the lowest
Charisma rating will begin to walk in a trancelike state toward
the altar.
ROOM  3-4:  Rubble.
ROOM 3-41: Entirely filled with rubble.
ROOM 3-5: A mated pair of trolls have their honeymoon cot-
tage in this room. They come and go through a narrow crack in
the roof. They will continue their amorous pursuits unless inter-
rupted, will not attack unless attacked or interrupted first, and
will not pursue characters who flee back out the door.
Trolls: AC: 6 Move: 120’ Att: 2 claws and 1 bite
Dam: 1-6 each Dex: 15 HP: 30,24 HD: 6 + 3
Other party members will see this and possibly be shocked to
their senses by the prospect of danger to their comrade. They
will now be allowed a saving throw against the Charm spell (with
the +2 blessing from Shar, if it applies). If some or all of them
break the charm, there will be time to try to combat the vampire
priest before the entranced adventurer reaches the altar and the
evil priest’s grasp. If no party member makes a saving throw vs.
the charming, they will be compelled to watch unresistingly as
their comrade meets the same fate as the acolyte. Then the
“selection process” will repeat, and the party member with the
next lowest Charisma will be sacrificed unless rescued.
ROOM 3-51:  A pile of rubble which currently serves as the
trolls’ love-nest.
ROOM 3-6: This is the room that party members slide into
when they enter this level of the chapel. In so doing they alarm
the resident, a cockatrice. The creature is understandably pan-
icked and takes wing, flying wildly about the room and bumping
into walls.
The priest’s congregation is composed of dazed, unarmed
peasants. There are 30 present, but half of them will instantly
flee once they see an attack being mounted against them or the
priest. The remainder will attack, or at least will serve to obstruct
the party if its intention is to get to the priest. They are level 0
characters, armor class 10, and will take only 1 hit point of
damage before becoming demoralized and rushing for the stairs
which descend to Level 5. If they attack and succeed, each blow
struck by one of them does 1 point of damage.
Cockatrice: AC: 6 Move: 180’ (flying) Att: 1
Dam: 1 plus petrification Dex: 16 HP: 20 HD: 5
The cockatrice will attack only if it is attacked, and even then
at a -2 to hit. However, even if it does not consciously attack, the
monster can still cause petrification if it accidentally bumps into
a party member. There is a 1 in 20 chance that the monster will
hit a character in a certain melee round (roll separately for each
character once per round) in the course of its thrashing about.
Cracks in the walls and ceiling of the room admit enough light to
enable party members to see the cockatrice and attempt to
avoid it.
The priest is a true vampire. He can be conquered by magical
means, and an appropriately worded wish (using the ring found
on Level 2) can eliminate this threat to the party’s success. The
priest will not be on his guard against the party members until an
attack is actually begun, since he believes them to all be under
the influence of the charm spell.
Those who are charmed will simply stand awaiting their mas-
ter’s order. If the vampire is destroyed, the charm is broken.

value until they draw back the black curtain. They will then be
confronted by a representation of the Dark God which is so
lifelike and so horrible that they will be struck dumb by terror.
No character will be able to speak or communicate by vocal
sound in any way whatsoever for the rest of the adventure.
The stairs (leading down from Room 3-31) are dark, but as the
party approaches the bottom of the incline, characters become
aware of a ruddy glow emanating from floor level below. After
descending several feet further, they will exit into a large room
similar in size and shape to the chamber on Level 1. The entry-
way they come through is along the back wall of area 3.
As each character enters, he or she quickly becomes aware
that a temple service of some sort is in progress and feels
compelled to quietly join those standing at the back of the
congregation. (This compulsion is the result of a low-strength
Charm spell of short duration and allowing no saving throw
upon initial contact.)
The congregation fills the areas marked 2, 3, and 4 on the map.
Wide staircases going down are seen in the recessed areas
numbered 1 and 5, while the recess which forms area 6 is cur-
tained off from the main chamber with black velvet.
In front of the curtain stand a black-robed priest and his
scarlet-clad acolyte. Before them in the center of the room is an
elaborately carved hexagonal altar of obsidian, in the place
where the center column appears in each of the above levels.
Just as the characters are struck dumb, so should the players
be. For the rest of the adventure, the Dungeon Master should
allow no vocal communication between players. In many in-
stances, this will make it necessary for the DM to give descrip-
tions or instructions to players in secret. At other times, a caller
for the group may be asked to give information vocally to the
DM, out of earshot of other players, so the DM will know precise-
ly what the players are intending to do — or, at least, what-the
caller interprets as the plan. No characters or players should be
allowed to communicate with each other by any means besides
gestures or pictures — except for those characters who are
magic-users or clerics, or any other characters with Intelligence
of 15 or higher. These characters may give information by
means of written messages, but may not receive such messages
from a character who does not have those qualities. Players
should be given plenty of time to work things out at pivotal
points in the adventure from this point on, but they should not be
allowed to talk!
As members of the party watch in fascination, the priest in-
tones a long passage in an unknown tongue while the acolyte
chants occasional replies or affirmations. Suddenly the priest
seizes the acolyte by hip and shoulder and raises his body high
overhead. In another instant, he brings the body down on the
altar and buries his fangs in the acolyte’s neck. After taking a
long, ceremonial draught for himself, the priest catches the rest
of the acolyte’s life blood in a black basin. He then proceeds on a
meandering path throughout the congregation, splashing blood
on their faces and dipping their hands into the basin. When the
This level contains the household of the vampire priest. It is
designed primarily to give the players and characters a chance
to use silent communication.
It is possible for the party to simply proceed through the
vestibule in Room 5-5 or Room 5-1 and keep descending into
Level 6, or to leave the complex altogether by way of Room 5-61
or Room 5-11. In any of those cases, however, party members
will remain speechless forever— or until they re-enter the chap-
el complex and are successful in completing the entire prophecy.

sconces, Ceilings are 10 feet high.
ROOM 5-0: This is a hexagonal room used as a hall or com-
mon room. There is a door in each of the six walls and a trestle
table with benches in the center of the room.
ROOM 5-1: A vestibule and landing. A wide staircase comes
down from the temple above and continues to the level below,
This room is a landing between the two flights of stairs. There is

road which leads away to the north.
ROOM  5-2: This is the kitchen. It has a fireplace on the outside
wall, a work table and 8 rough chair. Three iron pots filled with
some sort of stew sit bubbling on the hearth.
There is a young woman sitting in the chair, She was once
pretty, but is now so dirty and frightened-looking that it is hard
to perceive her beauty.
This is Elna, the vampire priest’s cook, maid, and probable
future victim once she outlives her usefulness as a servant. She
is not a vampire and will not be hostile. She will not attack or
defend herself and will provide no information. She will merely
stare silently at the party unless someone gives her an order or
makes a request, in which case she will calmly obey if it is in her
power to do so. She will follow the party when they leave this
room unless she is actively prevented from doing so.
ROOM 5-21: This is the pantry and contains cooking equip-
ment and various unwholesome foodstuffs, none of which is of
any use to characters.
ROOM 5-3: This room is part of the living quarters for the four
ghoulish warriors of the temple. They traverse the countryside
looking for “converts,” and make sure that services are properly
attended. (However, they themselves don’t go to church,)
The room has doors on opposite sides and rough beds along
two of the other walls. Rags and rubbish litter the floor, and the
smell is oppressive.
When the party enters the room, two ghouls will be positioned
in the center of the room, they will not be surprised, and they will
immediately move to attack. If a battle is joined, the two other
ghouls (from Room 5-4) will move in to assist their fellow
warriors.
Ghouls: AC: 6 Move: 90’ Att: 3 Dam: 1-3 plus
paralysis for 1-4 turns Dex: 15 HP: 14, 12 8, 6 HD: 3
ROOM 5-31: This is a storeroom filled with personal effects
and possessions stripped from the ghouls’ and the vampire’s
victims. A careful search taking at least 1 turn will yield 3-12gp,
4-24sp and 1-100cp. There is a 25% chance of finding a piece of
jewelry worth 50gp if party members search for 3 turns or
longer.
ROOM 5-4: The contents and occupants of this room are
originally the same as those of Room 5-3 — two ghouls and
some rough furniture. However, ghouls will never be encoun-
tered in both rooms in the same fashion.
If the party enters Room 5-4 before it enters Room 5-3, the
events described above will take place in Room 5-4 instead, with
the ghouls from Room 5-3 coming to the aid of the others. In
either case, the two ghouls with the highest number of hit points
will originate from whichever of the two rooms the party enters
first.
If the party retreats from either room in an attempt to avoid
Dragon
combat, all four ghouls will issue forth from the two rooms and
engage the adventurers in Room 5-0.
ROOM 5-41: The contents of this room are identical to those
of Room 5-31, except that there is no chance of finding jewelry.
Instead, a bag containing 60gp will be discovered by the first
character who searches for longer than 3 turns.
ROOM 5-5: A wide staircase comes down from the temple
above and ends in this room, which serves as the vestry where
the vampire priest robes himself and prepares for services. The
walls are adorned with heavily embroidered vestments. While
rich-looking, they emanate an aura of evil which may noticeably
repulse certain party members. Any good character who tries on
a garment or vestment or attempts to carry an article of this sort
will receive a “shock” from contact with such concentrated
wickedness, losing 2 hit points and being forced to drop the evil
item.
Leaning against the wall in one corner of the room is a Wand
of Fear with six charges remaining.
ROOM 5-51: This is a closet which contains vessels, basins,
and other equipment for the services. Each of the receptacles or
other decoratives pieces appears to be worth about 300gp and
may be obtained by non-evil characters, but those who carry
them will lose 1 hit point per day from contact with the evil
object. There is also a Potion of Healing (1-6 points) and a
Potion of Delusion, both in stoppered crystal flasks, and a
cursed (-2) dagger.
ROOM 5-6: The priest’s living chambers — surprisingly neat
and spartan. It holds a bed, two chairs and a chest, which
contains nothing but black clothing made of a rich-looking
fabric. Like the vestments in Room 5-5, these items may not be
tried on or carried by a good character without causing harm.
ROOM  5-61:  The priest’s closet. Several black cloaks are hung
on pegs on the wall. They, like the other cloths and garments of
evil origin in this area, may not be carried or worn. Among them
and partially hidden are a brown cloak (non-magical) and a
green cloak (which is an Elven Cloak).
There is a trap door in the floor, giving access to stairs which
lead down to a secret exit from the chapel at the base of the cliff.
DM: Nothing should prevent the party from leaving the chapel
to rest and recuperate and then re-entering the complex to take
up the quest anew. However, if Bran is with the party, he will try
to persuade the adventurers to stay inside the chapel. If the
party exits the chapeI, Bran will remain close to the base of the
cliff and will not follow the party if it ventures out of his sight.
Since neither Bran nor any of the others is capable of speech at
this point, it is unlikely that the adventurers would simply depart.
Some party members will remember the part of the prophecy
Which said the dumb will speak, and this will serve as an inspira-
tion for them to continue the quest. If (when) party members
return to the chapel, everything inside will be as it was the
moment they left.
Also note that clerics in the party will still be able to turn
undead and to heal despite being unable to speak.
LEVEL 6
This is a large, roughly hexagonal chamber with well-finished
walls, similar in shape and size to Levels 1 and 4, but with no
central column. The room is entered by one of the two stair-
cases, either from Room 5-5 into area 6-5 (party emerges facing
area 2) or from Room 5-1 into area 6-1 (party emerges facing
area 4 — but see description of skeletons, below). The entire
Ievel is dark and must be illuminated by the adventurers.
The central area of the level is filled with the figures of 20
kneeling skeletons. Each has his bony hands clamped around
the hilt of a sword. Ten of them form an aisle leading from the
41Dragon
bottom of the stairs in area 6-5 and pointing in the direction of
area 6-2 — where the bodies of Owen and Andrea sit enthroned
in a regal setting. A similar, gauntlet-style configuration is,
formed by the other 10, pointing from the bottom of the staircase
in area 6-1 to the adjacent area where Owen and Andrea are.
Party members will immediately recognize Owen and Andrea as
the couple depicted in the dream they had earlier.
The party will not be endangered until at least one member
walks all the way down one of the aisles after descending the
stairs. When the member(s) leading the way are past the end of
the aisle and presumed (by the skeletons) to be approaching the
throne area, and all 20 skeletons will come alive and begin to
attack. Stepping through the boundary of an aisle or attacking a
skeleton while it is inanimate will also cause all the skeletons to
begin fighting.
Skeletons: AC: 8 Move: 60’ Att: 1 Dam: 1-6 Dex: 9
HP: All 20 have 3 HP each HD:½
On the wall at the back of area 6 is a painting of a warrior, a
merchant and a seaman. On the wall at the back of area 3 is a
painting of a farmer, a hunter and a beautiful woman. If a light
strikes the eyes of the figures in the paintings, they will become
animate. The paintings are placed high enough on the wall so
that a figure’s eyes cannot be illuminated by accident. Charac-
ters should be able to tell that there is some sort of painting on
the wall, but not to tell what the subject is, without directly
illuminating the picture.
These figures represent the good gods of Owen and Andrea,
who placed images of themselves in these “living paintings” to
aid and guard the couple. These figures, like the party members
and the bodies of Owen and Andrea, cannot speak.
The warrior fights with a sword, the seaman with a trident, the
farmer with a pitchfork, and the hunter with a spear. The mer-
chant has a leather bag of coins which he uses as a blackjack.
None of these weapons can be held or employed by other
members of the party. Each of these figures is treated as a
Vol. V, No. 12
third-level fighter in melee, armor class 2, move 90’. Each does
1-6 points of damage with a successful hit. The woman does not
fight, but her touch (as if rolling to hit) will heal 1-6 points of
damage.
When any of these figures takes 10 hit points of damage, it will
return to its place in the painting on the wall. The paintings can
be reanimated. The figures may be employed to aid the party in
the fight against the skeletons, which will attack mindlessly until
destroyed. The talismans from Level 2 can be of help here; if a
character kept the ivory horn (hunter), iron plow (farmer), mod-
el ship (seaman) or gold thimble (woman), that character will be
able to control the actions of that particular figure. Otherwise,
the DM will moderate the actions of all the god-figures who
come into play.
If the party and its helpers succeed in beating the skeletons,
the adventurers will find themselves still without speech, since
they have not yet fulfilled the entire prophecy.
When the last skeleton falls, the bodies of Owen and Andrea
will rise from their thrones and make imploring gestures toward
the party members. Both of the bodies must be stabbed with a
magic sword, once and for all putting their owners to rest.
When this is done, the bodies will sink to the floor in a relaxed
posture—and the characters will discover that they (but not the
painted figures) can speak again! The walls and floor of the
chamber will quiver and shake momentarily as the dark god’s
influence is expelled. In another moment, Shar joins the group.
He will provide the prompting, if necessary, to cause the charac-
ters to look under the thrones, where a pair of compartments
hold the wondrous royal treasures — theirs for the taking.
All of the painted figures and party members will form a
funeral procession and bear the bodies of Owen and Andrea
outside, up the cliff, and in the front door to their proper tombs
on the ground level of the chapel. The lids of the sarcophagi will
be lifted back into position and closed, whereupon all of the
painted figures will vanish and reappear in their places on the
walls — although they may stay around long enough to clear up
any mysteries that remain.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Dragon Magazine Original Data</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To the Dungeon Master
This is an adventure for a balanced party of six second- and
third-level characters; if desired, the number may be increased
by including three first-level characters. The party is assumed to
be armored with chainmail and shields or the rough equivalent,
with the exception of any magic-users.
Since the episode begins with the characters in the midst of a
journey, magic-users may be assumed to have their spell books
with them. The books are packed in strong waterproof and
airtight cases which are difficult to open and close. Cases can be
opened only at times when the magic-user has absolute security
for a period of several hours and in locations where the books
are absolutely safe from dampness.
In order to succeed, the party must have at least one magic
sword by the time they reach the evil temple. Similarly, one
good, all-purpose piece of magic seems to be necessary if the
party is to maintain adequate strength to succeed in the final
battle. Consequently, the scenario provides for a magic sword
and a Ring of Three Wishes  to be found on the second level.
The party should be essentially good in alignment, since oth-
erwise the motivations for finishing the adventure do not make
sense. In addition, cooperation among members of the party is
not merely a virtue: It is a necessity for survival.
A party of this size and capability should be able to “clean out”
the Chapel if the members perform well and take advantage of
their opportunities to recuperate. The wish ring will revive dead
adventurers, and this is a good strategic use for it — perhaps an
essential one.
The chapel is built near the edge of a cliff. The underground
areas below it were hollowed out from the stone of the cliff. In
some areas the remaining stone wall is so thin that it has broken,
or has been broken, through to the outside.
Background (for the DM only)
The Chapel of Silence was built several centuries ago by
Baron Owen the Even-Handed to celebrate his marriage to the
lovely Lady Andrea. This noble pair ruled long and well over
their little barony. Their reign was, in fact, so benign and pros-
perous that both were revered as saints during their lives. Dur-
ing that era the Chapel was furnished with beauty and elegance.
Burial in its crypts was considered the ultimate honor and was
thought to insure an afterlife of eternal bliss.
In due course Owen died of old age, and the grieving Andrea
outlived him by only two days. They were entombed in the
chapel which Owen raised in gratitude for and tribute to his
lovely bride. After their deaths, Owen and Andrea were remem-
bered and worshiped along with the benign gods to whom the
chapel was originally dedicated. Eventually, the cult which wor-
shiped the baron and his lady diminished in power but remained
a pleasant memory among the people of the barony.
In recent years the cult of Owen and Andrea has been revived
in a sinister guise. Following an earthquake which breached the
cliff on which the chapel stands, a vampire priest of he Dark God
moved into the lower reaches of the tower, taking over the crypts
where the good were buried and converting the burial vaults to
his own evil purpose.
The vampire has gained the acceptance of the people by
pretending to worship Owen and Andrea. To this end he has
transported their miraculously preserved bodies from their
tombs and enthroned them in the lowest level of their chapel,
there to “rule” over the skeletal bodies of his victims.
The priest has gradually stripped the chapel of its beauty and
hidden the lovely and valuable treasures that used to be part of
the worship services.
36
The true gods of the chapel, devoted to the cause of good,
have contrived to keep the upper portion of the chapel relatively
free from sacrilege— but only relatively free, since the Dark God
continually attempts to wrest more space and power from the
good gods, while at the same time the forces of good keep trying
to cleanse their chapel. Thus, few areas of the chapel can be said
to be wholly good or wholly evil since each force infiltrates the
other’s territory. The spirits of Andrea and Owen look on in
restless misery, desiring only the comfort of oblivion. Andrea
begs travelers for her rescue, but Owen does not wish additional
deaths to be suffered on his behalf.
Background for players
Your party is on a journey through a mountainous region
distinguished by sheer cliffs and dangerous precipices. Thus
everyone is quite grateful when, just at nightfall, they find a
small abandoned chapel. It provides a dry shelter from the wind
and radiates such an aura of good that there is no hesitation
about sheltering within it.
It is a relatively small room, hexagonal in shape with a central
altar. It is impossible to determine the deity who was served
here, since the chapel has been vandalized. Visible among the
wreckage are the remains of a few benches and two stone
tombs. Even the tombs have been desecrated, so that the sleep-
ing statues of an ancient lord and his fair lady preside over
obviously empty sepulchers.
During the night each member of the party has a dream.
Note to the DM: Following is an accurate description of the
important facts of the dream which is designed to help inspire
the party members to succeed in their quest. It is possible that
not every adventurer will have exactly the same dream, and
some of the party members may not have such a dream at all.
The DM is encouraged to use judgement in moderating the
dream and its after-effects to best suit the abilities and charac-
teristics of the players and their characters.
The dream:
The chapel seems filled with light and a happy throng of
people, and it is apparent that a wedding is in progress. Just as
the priest pronounces his final blessing upon the betrothed pair,
the scene fades. A new scene follows it — a scene as sorrowful
as its predecessor was joyful. Again the chapel is full of people,
but this time all are weeping. A funeral procession escorts two
shrouded bodies to their tombs and tearfully places them within.
Once again the priest pronounces a final blessing and the scene
fades.
A third scene follows; again the chapel is full of light. The
adventurers themselves are the only ones in attendance, but
suddenly they are struck dumb with surprise as the figure of a
lovely woman appears at the altar. Silently she beckons to the
party, and each member senses her promise that person (the
one who is having the particular dream) boundless reward if he
will but follow her. Just as that character steps forward, there is a
blinding flash and a stalwart man suddenly stands beside the
lady with a sword in his hand. While the lady begins to weep
entreatingly, the man steps to prevent anyone from approach-
ing her. He sadly shakes his head in refusal of the lady’s pleas.
The scene then gradually fades, and each character awakens.
In the gray light of dawn, the party rises somberly and breaks
its fast upon rations from the packs. Finally, one member breaks
the silence and speaks of his strange dream. A discussion fol-
lows during which everyone relates his or her dream and the
members decide to further investigate the chapel.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">LEVEL 1
A careful search of the chapel will reveal that the altar slides
easily to one side, revealing a spiral staircase curving down into
the dark. The stairs wind around a central column and eventual-
ly emerge in the center of a large shadowy room.
This room, like all other rooms below the level of the chapel
itself, has been carved out of the cliff rock. The floor is smooth
stone. On this level the ceiling is very high, impossible to see
from the floor by lantern or torchlight.
The room is roughly hexagonal with six large open chambers
around the perimeter. The stone walls have been dressed very
smooth and covered with plaster. Along the back wall of each
niche is a large picture painted on the wall itself. The pictures
are positioned rather high on the walls, so that they cannot be
closely inspected without raising a torch or lantern high over-
head and approaching to within about 15 feet of the wall.
When the light strikes the eyes of one or more beings depicted
in a certain painting, all beings in the picture will be animated
and will come out fighting. They will all attack the party (except
in the case of Picture 3), doing and taking normal damage. When
a painted creature loses half its hit points it will vanish from the
battle and reappear as part of the picture again. If the picture is
darkened and lighted again, the creature(s) will emerge once
more with hit points restored to maximum (except for Picture 3).
The subjects of the pictures are:
1. The tower as it was first built, revealing to the charac-
ters that it stands at the top of a tall, sheer cliff.
2. An ogre: Armor Class: 6 Move per turn: 90’ Attacks

As the party exits the bottom of the
stairs, they will be facing the wall con-
taining Picture 1.
The armored man in Picture 3 is Law-
ful Good and if not attacked by the party
will join it after the goblins are defeated.
He will, fight very bravely, actively seek-
ing the forefront of the battle. When he
has lost half his hit points he will disap-
pear and reappear in his picture, whence
he can be reactivated by a clever charac-
ter. He cannot speak and is illiterate but
is quite good at communicating by signs.
A careful examination of the area will
reveal the following words engraved in
ancient common around the perimeter
of the floor at the entrances to the
chambers. Numbers correspond to the
location of the floor section bearing
those words.
1: CLEAN AGAlN WHEN THE LlGHT OF
2: LIFE COMES TO LIFELESS EYES
3: AND MORTAL SWORD SLAYS
FLESH
4: IMMORTAL THEN WILL THE DUMB
SPEAK
5: THE DEAD DIE THE DARK GOD TOPPLE
6: AND THE CHAPEL OF SILENCE BE
Commas help prophecies immensely. Properly punctuated
and ordered, this one reads, “When the light of life comes to
lifeless eyes, and mortal sword slays flesh immortal; then will the
dumb speak, the dead die, the dark god topple, and the Chapel
of Silence be clean again.”
If a character looks for another prophecy on the ceiling, he
will only succeed in reanimating one or more pictures.
A thorough search of the entire floor will eventually reveal a
trap door directly at the bottom of the stairs where the party
entered. Another circular stair leads further down.
LEVEL 2
The second flight of stairs is much shorter than the first,
indicating a much lower ceiling (about 10’ in height). On this
level the stone walls are smoothly dressed but not plastered.
Partition walls are stone masonry. Doors are wooden, very
heavy, and open inward. They are metal-bound and have metal
hardware. All floors are smooth stone except for that of the
center room.
ROOM 2-0: The flight of stairs exits from the inside of a
hexagonal column in the center of a hexagonal room. The room
is 20’ on a side with a door in the center of each of the six walls.
The floor here is dark and glass-like with no visible seams,
The party emerges from the stairway facing the door to Room
2-1. At their feet are several inanimate human skeletons.
Examination of the skeletons will show that there were at least
nine bodies, since parts of nine different skulls can be identified.
There is no treasure, and what remains of the arms and armor of
the skeletons has deteriorated beyond use.
The floor is so slippery that each character has one chance in
six of falling the first time he attempts to walk across it, and one
chance in four if he tries to run.
37Dragon
PERIMETER ROOMS: All perimeter rooms are basically the
same. Each contains an altar and three kneeling benches uphol-
stered in velvet. The three walls of each room furthest from the
door are draped with velvet. Before each drape stands a skelet-
on with its hands in an attitude of prayer. (The skeletons do not
animate if handled gently and respectfully.) Behind the center
drape is a smooth wall with no visible masonry joints. It seems to
be plastered and is painted a dull white. It is actually a sliding
panel and will move (when proper pressure is applied) 5’ to the
right, revealing a triangular secret room.
The details of the perimeter rooms and the secret rooms are as
follows:
ROOM 2-1: The velvet is deep red. The altar is engraved with
scenes of battle and the skeletons are wearing armor.
ROOM 2-11: As soon as the door is fully open, a bolt is
released from a crossbow in the apex of the triangle. If it hits it
will do 1-6 points of damage.
A thick layer of dust covers the floor and the articles thereon.
The room contains several pieces of armor which look more
ceremonial than useful. Two items of evident value are a je-
welled helmet and a sword with a golden hilt. (Estimated value:
20gp each) The rest is obviously of little value and less useful-
ness. At the very back of the room there is a long bundle
wrapped in a soldier’s cloak. It contains a very plain, simply
crafted sword of excellently forged metal in mint condition.
ROOM 2-2: The draperies and upholstery are dull gold. The
altar engraving shows scenes of commerce. The skeletons wear
three-piece garments of conservative cut.
ROOM 2-21: When the secret door is opened, a pit taking up
the entire floor area of the room is revealed. The sides are
smooth and sheer. A character who falls into the pit will be lost
without a trace.
ROOM 2-3: Hangings and upholstery are rich green. The altar
has hunting scenes; the skeletons are attired as hunters.
ROOM 2-31:  The secret room contains ancient, moth-eaten
hunting trophies. The dust in the room bears evidence of recent
traffic. There is a small ivory hunting horn hanging high over the
door in semi-darkness. The party will notice it on a roll of 1 or 2
on d6, or if anyone specifically states that he is looking at the
wall over the door.
ROOM 2-4: In this room are two grave robbers armed with
swords. They will be hiding behind the door when it is opened
and will then attempt to strike from behind.
Primo: AC 5 Move: 60’ Att: 1 Dam: 1-6 Dex: 14
HP: 12 HD:2.
Gundo: AC 5 Move: 60’ Att: 1 Dam: 1-6 Dex: 11
HP: 15 HD: 3.
Both bags together also contain four combs, three necklaces,
and a ruby bracelet. Gundo’s bag contains a gold ring set with
three large pearls. The total value of this haul is about 500gp,
excluding the ring. It is a Ring of Three Wishes.
The room is decorated in rich brown. The altar shows scenes
of planting and reaping, and the skeletons wear the attire of rich
peasants.
ROOM 2-41: A large bear trap (1-4) awaits the first unwary
foot across the entrance. The trap may be sprung with a pole or
similar implement.
The dust in this room is deep and undisturbed. In the center of
the room is a small table bearing a golden bowl heaped full of
grain. To the right of the table is a small golden scythe. To the
left is a miniature iron plow. The bowl and scythe are worth
about 100gp each.

<p class="regtxt9">As the secret door slides open, a large swatch of dusty silk cascades into the room. A full-size silk sail has been stuffed loosely and carelessly into the room. The sail shows its age but is still reasonably strong. If it is all pulled out, the party will find a quantity of gilded rope in the northern corner. If that is moved off or across the floor, they will find a small but very elegant ship model. It is of ivory with silken sails and fine gold rigging. The robbers apparently overlooked it while wrestling with the sail and rope. Its value is hard to assess because of its obviously great artistic merit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">ROOM 2-6: All the cloth in this room is of a delicate rose-
colored hue. The skeletons are clothed in women’s robes and
the altar is carved with scenes of the home.
ROOM 2-61: The room has evidently been looted. There is a
broken clay pot within, and a churn lying on it side. In the churn
is a dirty scrap of paper which is actually a Scroll of Healing.
Deep in the dust in the corner is a small golden thimble.
There is a trap door in the floor which opens to reveal a flight
of stairs going down.
When the party attempts to leave this level, the skeletons from
the perimeter rooms will attack, either one after the other or
simultaneously, with each skeleton’s first attack always sur-
prising.
If the party is leaving by the trap door in Room 2-6, the
skeletons in that room will attack first with the others arriving as
reinforcements at the rate of three per round. They will not
follow the party down the stairs, and no other skeletons will
enter and fight if all skeletons present are killed at the end of any
round; however, those which don’t enter will instantly attack (no
automatic surprise) when someone re-enters the center room.

If the party attempts to retreat up the stairs back to the chapel,
they will find the altar has been moved back over the trap door,
and it is impossible to remove from below.
When all party members are on the descending stairs (which
appear very smooth and solid, the staircase will suddenly turn
into a slide and the party will arrive at the floor of the next level
tumbled into a heap. The character in the lead on the stairs will
take 1-3 points of damage from the slide and the collisions with
his followers.
LEVEL 3
The walls are rough-hewn stone and exhibit a large number of
cracks as a result of the earthquake some years ago. There are
heaps of stone and rubbish everywhere.
The rooms are hexagonal, following the same general pattern
as on Level 2. Most of the doors hang a bit crazily on their
hinges, although two are still wholly functional. The large rooms
on this level seem to have been intended as crypts, but no
corpses remain in sight.
The party lands at the bottom of the slide in Room 3-6.
ROOM 3-0:  There is nothing here but dust and rubble. The
outside of the central column is still intact but the stairway
inside has collapsed, filling the lower part of the column.
ROOM 3-1: The door to this room is intact and closed. When it
is opened, the party will see a clean, airy room with an opening
to the outside. There is a bed of sorts at one side, a catchbasin
for water, and a cooking area near the opening. A man in ragged
clerical robes sits with his back to the party looking out through
the area where Room 3-11 should be.
The man is Shar, the hermit. He subsists on the kindness of
the local people, lowering his basket on a long cord to receive
their donations. He cannot speak.
If the party offers gold or other valuables to Shar he will
smilingly refuse, but if any member shares his food with him,
Shar will silently bless that adventurer. The blessing of Shar is a
great gift, since it will heal each recipient to within two hit points
of original strength and give that character a +2 bonus on all
saving throws for the duration of the adventure.
If a character holding or carrying the steel sword (from Level
2) receives the blessing, the sword will be felt to leap in its
wrappings. Upon examination, it will be seen to display a soft,
magical glow. From this moment on it may be used as a +2 magic
sword.
If the party attacks Shar, the hermit will simply vanish to the
protection of the good gods until the threat is past, at which time
he will reappear in his chamber.
Shar’s cave is safe from all evil and can provide the party a
place to rest and recover. A magic-user can study his spell book
while sequestered here if he so desires.
Although Shar cannot speak, he can communicate effectively
by gestures, pictures, end written words, though his version of
the common tongue is archaic by the party members’ standards.
He will help the party in any way he can (once he is befriended)
but will refuse to go anywhere else in the complex with them.
Shar was the chief priest of the chapel in the days of Owen’s
life. He and Bran, Owen’s chief captain, have been called upon
by the gods to be the guards of the chapel. Shar came originally
from the foreground of the chapel picture on Level 1, where he
was “implanted” just like other images were in the other pic-
tures. However, Shar was able to remain out of the picture after
being released by light at a much earlier time, and thinks he can
better serve as a chapel guard by keeping watch over the breach
caused by the earthquake.
Bran is, of course, the armed man from another of the Level 1
pictures. Their attributes are as follows:
Shar: Cleric Lawful Good HP: 15 HD: 3 Str: 16
Int: 14 Wis: 18 Con: 13 Dex: 12 Cha: 15.
Bran: Fighter Lawful Good HP: 24 HD: 3 Str: 18
Int: 12 Wis: 12 Con: 18 Dex: 14 Cha: 15.
ROOM 3-11:  The ruins of this room form the “porch” of Shar’s
cave. The steepness and smoothness of the cliff sides will not
permit descent by this route. Shar will not cooperate in any plan
by the party to use this as an exit.
ROOM 3-2: This chamber is dimly lit in the daytime by light
which seeps in through several cracks in the exterior walls. It
contains a nest of four stirges. They will attack any character or
creature who enters, but will not pursue any intruder outside the
room. The door to this room is slightly out of kilter because of
the earthquake and does not close tightly.
Stirges: AC: 7 Move: 180’ Att: 1 (Attacks at +2)
Dam: 1-3 HP plus 1-4 blood drain per melee round
thereafter Dex: 6 HP: 8,8, 3, 3 HD: 1.
ROOM 3-21: Filled with rubble.
ROOM  3-3:  The room is pitch dark, and the territory is jealous-
ly guarded by a wight. The wight can be hit only by magic
weapons. Its touch does no damage in hit points but drains away
life energy. When the wight scores a hit, its opponent will drop
one experience level, losing the appropriate number of hit
points. A character who loses all of his/her levels (down to zero)
becomes a wight under the control of the original wight.
Wight: AC: 5 Move: 90’ Dex: 15 HP: 16 HD: 3
If the battle begins to go too badly for the party, the spirit of
Owen will intervene. He will appear in a blaze of light, defeat the
39Dragon
wight, and toss his +2 magic sword to the party. Owen will also
reveal the secret door at the back of the room.

supply of blood is used up in about five minutes, the priest will
utter a strange cry. Suddenly, the party member with the lowest
Charisma rating will begin to walk in a trancelike state toward
the altar.
ROOM  3-4:  Rubble.
ROOM 3-41: Entirely filled with rubble.
ROOM 3-5: A mated pair of trolls have their honeymoon cot-
tage in this room. They come and go through a narrow crack in
the roof. They will continue their amorous pursuits unless inter-
rupted, will not attack unless attacked or interrupted first, and
will not pursue characters who flee back out the door.
Trolls: AC: 6 Move: 120’ Att: 2 claws and 1 bite
Dam: 1-6 each Dex: 15 HP: 30,24 HD: 6 + 3
Other party members will see this and possibly be shocked to
their senses by the prospect of danger to their comrade. They
will now be allowed a saving throw against the Charm spell (with
the +2 blessing from Shar, if it applies). If some or all of them
break the charm, there will be time to try to combat the vampire
priest before the entranced adventurer reaches the altar and the
evil priest’s grasp. If no party member makes a saving throw vs.
the charming, they will be compelled to watch unresistingly as
their comrade meets the same fate as the acolyte. Then the
“selection process” will repeat, and the party member with the
next lowest Charisma will be sacrificed unless rescued.
ROOM 3-51:  A pile of rubble which currently serves as the
trolls’ love-nest.
ROOM 3-6: This is the room that party members slide into
when they enter this level of the chapel. In so doing they alarm
the resident, a cockatrice. The creature is understandably pan-
icked and takes wing, flying wildly about the room and bumping
into walls.
The priest’s congregation is composed of dazed, unarmed
peasants. There are 30 present, but half of them will instantly
flee once they see an attack being mounted against them or the
priest. The remainder will attack, or at least will serve to obstruct
the party if its intention is to get to the priest. They are level 0
characters, armor class 10, and will take only 1 hit point of
damage before becoming demoralized and rushing for the stairs
which descend to Level 5. If they attack and succeed, each blow
struck by one of them does 1 point of damage.
Cockatrice: AC: 6 Move: 180’ (flying) Att: 1
Dam: 1 plus petrification Dex: 16 HP: 20 HD: 5
The cockatrice will attack only if it is attacked, and even then
at a -2 to hit. However, even if it does not consciously attack, the
monster can still cause petrification if it accidentally bumps into
a party member. There is a 1 in 20 chance that the monster will
hit a character in a certain melee round (roll separately for each
character once per round) in the course of its thrashing about.
Cracks in the walls and ceiling of the room admit enough light to
enable party members to see the cockatrice and attempt to
avoid it.
The priest is a true vampire. He can be conquered by magical
means, and an appropriately worded wish (using the ring found
on Level 2) can eliminate this threat to the party’s success. The
priest will not be on his guard against the party members until an
attack is actually begun, since he believes them to all be under
the influence of the charm spell.
Those who are charmed will simply stand awaiting their mas-
ter’s order. If the vampire is destroyed, the charm is broken.
Vampire: AC: 2 Move: 120’ Att: 1 Dam: 1-10

value until they draw back the black curtain. They will then be
confronted by a representation of the Dark God which is so
lifelike and so horrible that they will be struck dumb by terror.
No character will be able to speak or communicate by vocal
sound in any way whatsoever for the rest of the adventure.
The stairs (leading down from Room 3-31) are dark, but as the
party approaches the bottom of the incline, characters become
aware of a ruddy glow emanating from floor level below. After
descending several feet further, they will exit into a large room
similar in size and shape to the chamber on Level 1. The entry-
way they come through is along the back wall of area 3.
As each character enters, he or she quickly becomes aware
that a temple service of some sort is in progress and feels
compelled to quietly join those standing at the back of the
congregation. (This compulsion is the result of a low-strength
Charm spell of short duration and allowing no saving throw
upon initial contact.)
The congregation fills the areas marked 2, 3, and 4 on the map.
Wide staircases going down are seen in the recessed areas
numbered 1 and 5, while the recess which forms area 6 is cur-
tained off from the main chamber with black velvet.
In front of the curtain stand a black-robed priest and his
scarlet-clad acolyte. Before them in the center of the room is an
elaborately carved hexagonal altar of obsidian, in the place
where the center column appears in each of the above levels.
Just as the characters are struck dumb, so should the players
be. For the rest of the adventure, the Dungeon Master should
allow no vocal communication between players. In many in-
stances, this will make it necessary for the DM to give descrip-
tions or instructions to players in secret. At other times, a caller
for the group may be asked to give information vocally to the
DM, out of earshot of other players, so the DM will know precise-
ly what the players are intending to do — or, at least, what-the
caller interprets as the plan. No characters or players should be
allowed to communicate with each other by any means besides
gestures or pictures — except for those characters who are
magic-users or clerics, or any other characters with Intelligence
of 15 or higher. These characters may give information by
means of written messages, but may not receive such messages
from a character who does not have those qualities. Players
should be given plenty of time to work things out at pivotal
points in the adventure from this point on, but they should not be
allowed to talk!
As members of the party watch in fascination, the priest in-
tones a long passage in an unknown tongue while the acolyte
chants occasional replies or affirmations. Suddenly the priest
seizes the acolyte by hip and shoulder and raises his body high
overhead. In another instant, he brings the body down on the
altar and buries his fangs in the acolyte’s neck. After taking a
long, ceremonial draught for himself, the priest catches the rest
of the acolyte’s life blood in a black basin. He then proceeds on a
meandering path throughout the congregation, splashing blood
on their faces and dipping their hands into the basin. When the
This level contains the household of the vampire priest. It is
designed primarily to give the players and characters a chance
to use silent communication.
It is possible for the party to simply proceed through the
vestibule in Room 5-5 or Room 5-1 and keep descending into
Level 6, or to leave the complex altogether by way of Room 5-61
or Room 5-11. In any of those cases, however, party members
will remain speechless forever— or until they re-enter the chap-
el complex and are successful in completing the entire prophecy.
Level 5 is built of roughly hewn stone. Rooms are constructed
Vol. V, No. 12June 1981
as on Levels 2 and 3, except that there is no column in the middle
of Room 5-0. Illumination is provided by small torches in wall
sconces, Ceilings are 10 feet high.
ROOM 5-0: This is a hexagonal room used as a hall or com-
mon room. There is a door in each of the six walls and a trestle
table with benches in the center of the room.
ROOM 5-1: A vestibule and landing. A wide staircase comes
down from the temple above and continues to the level below,
This room is a landing between the two flights of stairs. There is
an ordinary door in the eastern wall and a more ornate door in
the western walI.
ROOM 5-11: An exit into the outdoors. Double doors set into
the face of the cliff swing open easily, opening onto a narrow
road which leads away to the north.
ROOM  5-2: This is the kitchen. It has a fireplace on the outside
wall, a work table and 8 rough chair. Three iron pots filled with
some sort of stew sit bubbling on the hearth.
There is a young woman sitting in the chair, She was once
pretty, but is now so dirty and frightened-looking that it is hard
to perceive her beauty.
This is Elna, the vampire priest’s cook, maid, and probable
future victim once she outlives her usefulness as a servant. She
is not a vampire and will not be hostile. She will not attack or
defend herself and will provide no information. She will merely
stare silently at the party unless someone gives her an order or
makes a request, in which case she will calmly obey if it is in her
power to do so. She will follow the party when they leave this
room unless she is actively prevented from doing so.
ROOM 5-21: This is the pantry and contains cooking equip-
ment and various unwholesome foodstuffs, none of which is of
any use to characters.
ROOM 5-3: This room is part of the living quarters for the four
ghoulish warriors of the temple. They traverse the countryside
looking for “converts,” and make sure that services are properly
attended. (However, they themselves don’t go to church,)
The room has doors on opposite sides and rough beds along
two of the other walls. Rags and rubbish litter the floor, and the
smell is oppressive.
When the party enters the room, two ghouls will be positioned
in the center of the room, they will not be surprised, and they will
immediately move to attack. If a battle is joined, the two other
ghouls (from Room 5-4) will move in to assist their fellow
warriors.
Ghouls: AC: 6 Move: 90’ Att: 3 Dam: 1-3 plus
paralysis for 1-4 turns Dex: 15 HP: 14, 12 8, 6 HD: 3
ROOM 5-31: This is a storeroom filled with personal effects
and possessions stripped from the ghouls’ and the vampire’s
victims. A careful search taking at least 1 turn will yield 3-12gp,
4-24sp and 1-100cp. There is a 25% chance of finding a piece of
jewelry worth 50gp if party members search for 3 turns or
longer.
ROOM 5-4: The contents and occupants of this room are
originally the same as those of Room 5-3 — two ghouls and
some rough furniture. However, ghouls will never be encoun-
tered in both rooms in the same fashion.
If the party enters Room 5-4 before it enters Room 5-3, the
events described above will take place in Room 5-4 instead, with
the ghouls from Room 5-3 coming to the aid of the others. In
either case, the two ghouls with the highest number of hit points
will originate from whichever of the two rooms the party enters
first.
If the party retreats from either room in an attempt to avoid
Dragon
combat, all four ghouls will issue forth from the two rooms and
engage the adventurers in Room 5-0.
ROOM 5-41: The contents of this room are identical to those
of Room 5-31, except that there is no chance of finding jewelry.
Instead, a bag containing 60gp will be discovered by the first
character who searches for longer than 3 turns.
ROOM 5-5: A wide staircase comes down from the temple
above and ends in this room, which serves as the vestry where
the vampire priest robes himself and prepares for services. The
walls are adorned with heavily embroidered vestments. While
rich-looking, they emanate an aura of evil which may noticeably
repulse certain party members. Any good character who tries on
a garment or vestment or attempts to carry an article of this sort
will receive a “shock” from contact with such concentrated
wickedness, losing 2 hit points and being forced to drop the evil
item.
Leaning against the wall in one corner of the room is a Wand
of Fear with six charges remaining.
ROOM 5-51: This is a closet which contains vessels, basins,
and other equipment for the services. Each of the receptacles or
other decoratives pieces appears to be worth about 300gp and
may be obtained by non-evil characters, but those who carry
them will lose 1 hit point per day from contact with the evil
object. There is also a Potion of Healing (1-6 points) and a
Potion of Delusion, both in stoppered crystal flasks, and a
cursed (-2) dagger.
ROOM 5-6: The priest’s living chambers — surprisingly neat
and spartan. It holds a bed, two chairs and a chest, which
contains nothing but black clothing made of a rich-looking
fabric. Like the vestments in Room 5-5, these items may not be
tried on or carried by a good character without causing harm.
ROOM  5-61:  The priest’s closet. Several black cloaks are hung
on pegs on the wall. They, like the other cloths and garments of
evil origin in this area, may not be carried or worn. Among them
and partially hidden are a brown cloak (non-magical) and a
green cloak (which is an Elven Cloak).
There is a trap door in the floor, giving access to stairs which
lead down to a secret exit from the chapel at the base of the cliff.
DM: Nothing should prevent the party from leaving the chapel
to rest and recuperate and then re-entering the complex to take
up the quest anew. However, if Bran is with the party, he will try
to persuade the adventurers to stay inside the chapel. If the
party exits the chapeI, Bran will remain close to the base of the
cliff and will not follow the party if it ventures out of his sight.
Since neither Bran nor any of the others is capable of speech at
this point, it is unlikely that the adventurers would simply depart.
Some party members will remember the part of the prophecy
Which said the dumb will speak, and this will serve as an inspira-
tion for them to continue the quest. If (when) party members
return to the chapel, everything inside will be as it was the
moment they left.
Also note that clerics in the party will still be able to turn
undead and to heal despite being unable to speak.
LEVEL 6
This is a large, roughly hexagonal chamber with well-finished
walls, similar in shape and size to Levels 1 and 4, but with no
central column. The room is entered by one of the two stair-
cases, either from Room 5-5 into area 6-5 (party emerges facing
area 2) or from Room 5-1 into area 6-1 (party emerges facing
area 4 — but see description of skeletons, below). The entire
Ievel is dark and must be illuminated by the adventurers.
The central area of the level is filled with the figures of 20
kneeling skeletons. Each has his bony hands clamped around
the hilt of a sword. Ten of them form an aisle leading from the
41Dragon
bottom of the stairs in area 6-5 and pointing in the direction of
area 6-2 — where the bodies of Owen and Andrea sit enthroned
in a regal setting. A similar, gauntlet-style configuration is,
formed by the other 10, pointing from the bottom of the staircase
in area 6-1 to the adjacent area where Owen and Andrea are.
Party members will immediately recognize Owen and Andrea as
the couple depicted in the dream they had earlier.
The party will not be endangered until at least one member
walks all the way down one of the aisles after descending the
stairs. When the member(s) leading the way are past the end of
the aisle and presumed (by the skeletons) to be approaching the
throne area, and all 20 skeletons will come alive and begin to
attack. Stepping through the boundary of an aisle or attacking a
skeleton while it is inanimate will also cause all the skeletons to
begin fighting.
Skeletons: AC: 8 Move: 60’ Att: 1 Dam: 1-6 Dex: 9
HP: All 20 have 3 HP each HD:½
On the wall at the back of area 6 is a painting of a warrior, a
merchant and a seaman. On the wall at the back of area 3 is a
painting of a farmer, a hunter and a beautiful woman. If a light
strikes the eyes of the figures in the paintings, they will become
animate. The paintings are placed high enough on the wall so
that a figure’s eyes cannot be illuminated by accident. Charac-
ters should be able to tell that there is some sort of painting on
the wall, but not to tell what the subject is, without directly
illuminating the picture.
These figures represent the good gods of Owen and Andrea,
who placed images of themselves in these “living paintings” to
aid and guard the couple. These figures, like the party members
and the bodies of Owen and Andrea, cannot speak.
The warrior fights with a sword, the seaman with a trident, the
farmer with a pitchfork, and the hunter with a spear. The mer-
chant has a leather bag of coins which he uses as a blackjack.
None of these weapons can be held or employed by other
members of the party. Each of these figures is treated as a
Vol. V, No. 12
third-level fighter in melee, armor class 2, move 90’. Each does
1-6 points of damage with a successful hit. The woman does not
fight, but her touch (as if rolling to hit) will heal 1-6 points of
damage.
When any of these figures takes 10 hit points of damage, it will
return to its place in the painting on the wall. The paintings can
be reanimated. The figures may be employed to aid the party in
the fight against the skeletons, which will attack mindlessly until
destroyed. The talismans from Level 2 can be of help here; if a
character kept the ivory horn (hunter), iron plow (farmer), mod-
el ship (seaman) or gold thimble (woman), that character will be
able to control the actions of that particular figure. Otherwise,
the DM will moderate the actions of all the god-figures who
come into play.
If the party and its helpers succeed in beating the skeletons,
the adventurers will find themselves still without speech, since
they have not yet fulfilled the entire prophecy.
When the last skeleton falls, the bodies of Owen and Andrea
will rise from their thrones and make imploring gestures toward
the party members. Both of the bodies must be stabbed with a
magic sword, once and for all putting their owners to rest.
When this is done, the bodies will sink to the floor in a relaxed
posture—and the characters will discover that they (but not the
painted figures) can speak again! The walls and floor of the
chamber will quiver and shake momentarily as the dark god’s
influence is expelled. In another moment, Shar joins the group.
He will provide the prompting, if necessary, to cause the charac-
ters to look under the thrones, where a pair of compartments
hold the wondrous royal treasures — theirs for the taking.
All of the painted figures and party members will form a
funeral procession and bear the bodies of Owen and Andrea
outside, up the cliff, and in the front door to their proper tombs
on the ground level of the chapel. The lids of the sarcophagi will
be lifted back into position and closed, whereupon all of the
painted figures will vanish and reappear in their places on the
walls — although they may stay around long enough to clear up
any mysteries that remain.</p>
