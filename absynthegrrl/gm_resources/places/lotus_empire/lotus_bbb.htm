<p class="pagecaption">Blood Bath and Beyond</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This franchise of weapons shops was started by <a href="../../npcs/shareya.htm">Shareya</a>. She has expanded by franchising out the name into various cities throughout the Empire. She now has shops in most of the major cities. The profits go to support her acquisition of additional majik items and knowledge.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Weapons from this franchise are guaranteed to meet their descriptions exactly. This can range from excellent weapons to truly bargain basement pieces of trash, however, all descriptions provided by the various merchants will be scrupulouly accurate. It is up to the buyer to ask the right questions to determine exactly what they are getting.</p>
