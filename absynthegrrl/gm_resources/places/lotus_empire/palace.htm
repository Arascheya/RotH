<p class="pagecaption">Imperial Palace</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Palace of the Calipha, also known as the Gem of the Lotus and "the place to which all eyes turn", is one of the continuing architectural wonders of Huzuz. Built over the course of 500 years, the palace has expanded as the power and wealth of the Grand Caliph has grown. The palace in its current form has not changed in three generations. The Grand Caliph and his father both made additions, but they resisted tearing down old structures simply to build new ones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">From the viewpoint of the first court, the palace seems almost a city unto itself. It sprawls out over acres, gleaming with gold on all of the roofs. The lush public gardens adjoin it, giving everyone access to the seat of power in the Land of Fate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Palace of the Enlightened Throne is quite beloved by the people of Huzuz. As long as it exists and remains grand, each inhabitant of the city can take pride in it, and many people refer to it as "our palace". This attitude, makes it very impractical for anyone to steal from the Palace of the Enlightened Throne, for they would have trouble selling goods stolen from the palace to any resident of Huzuz.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In addition, there are numerous guards, and dozens of genies roam the palace. Most of these genies are well-rewarded for their services to the Grand Caliph, so they would not hesitate to stop or hunt a thief.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Palace Locations</p>

<p class="regtxt5">See the map of Jakara and the linked sub-maps for these locations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">1. The Court of Enlightenment</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Called the first court, this court faces the Golden Mosque. It is a broad court, and ornate tiles of red and blue cover most of it. Although it is impossible to tell from ground level, a viewer high above can see that the tiles are arranged to represent an outline of the Golden Mosque. Previous Grand Caliphas had used it to represent themselves, but the current Grand Calipha ordered this change as a sign of her commitment to the enlightened Paths of the Lotus.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The front court can hold up to 50,000 people, and at least that many fill the court whenever the Grand Caliph celebrates his Ascension day. He appears before them, speaking from the Pavilion of the Enlightened Throne. This is a platform, ten feet high, covered with a golden dome. It is enchanted so that a speaker on the platform may be heard by anyone in the court. A command word is required for this effect. Someone who does not speak the command word will not be heard, even if they are standing right next to the speaker. The pavilion is also enchanted with many protective spells; the Grand Caliph is immune to hostile magic while speaking from this platform.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">2. The Grand Gate of Delights - see Palace map</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This is the front entrance to the palace. The Grand Gate is an artistic structure, two tall (90 feet high) towers flank a pair of matched gates. One of the gates is made of the whitest marble, the other of the finest alabaster. On the first is inlaid gold and gems, depicting a mage on a flying carpet. On the second is inlaid silver and white gems, depicting a djinni flying through the clouds. The intent is clear - this area is guarded by both magic and genies.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The gate is usually open, but it is always guarded. It is the first line of defense for the palace. Since thousands of servants and visitors enter the palace each day, the guard here is a bit easier to pass. That is not to say their attention is lax, as they are quick to spot foreigners. It is here that weapons are checked, since nothing larger than a dagger may be worn in the presence of the Grand Caliph. Those passing within are scanned by a mage wearing a monocle of magic detection. They are not necessarily stopped, but any stranger radiating a heavy magical aura is watched throughout his visit.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The gate guards are under the command of Sedji al-Sanje (hmf/mk/13), a member of the Valiant mamluk society. He is present many of his waking hours, Sedji wants to know who is entering the palace. A man of wide experience and travels, Sedji was promoted when he spotted a holy slayer he had once known in another city. He foiled an assassination attempt before it could even begin, and the Grand Caliph rewarded him with this post.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The gate is staffed by 100 men, mamluks of the Valiant, and the Dutiful. They are all at least 5th level, and carry either magical scimitars or crossbows. Two mages, one a sorcerer and one an elementalist, and a sha'ir are always on hand as well. Each serves an eight-hour shift with every third day off. Currently the mages are led by Naib ibn-Sodar, (efW/so/14), and range in levels from 8 to 12. All carry  paralyzation wands  or other magic useful for subduing hostile visitors.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The gate also features a large gong. This can be struck normally, or it can be activated by a command word known to everyone on guard. If sounded, 1-6 mages and 10-100 mamluks arrive every other round for the next six rounds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">3. The Court of Proclamations</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Second Court is where important proclamations are made. It is a large court, over 2,000 lucky visitors can crowd into this court when proclamations are made. Such announcements happen weekly, informing those gathered of titles awarded, commendations earned, and also those who have earned disgrace and censure.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">4. Hall of Commanders</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This large hall is the home for the leaders of the mamluks, guards, and admiralty. Thokkor of the Furrowed Mountains, Preani Quin, and Sedji al-Sanje are quartered here. The apartments are lush, and each has its own servants.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">5. Stables</p>

<p class="regtxt9">These stables hold up to 200 horses on the first level and a hundred hippogriffs on the second level. A leatherworker and smith are on hand daily for repair and refitting. A detachment of mounted mamluks can be in the air in less than five rounds. The winged cavalry are comprised of elite units (all mamluks of 7th level or higher) that are trained at fighting in aerial combat. Several dozen servants are responsible for care and feeding the animals. The stables also have a priest assigned to them; her responsibility is the health of the animals and their riders.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">6. Abode of Prince Cheddah</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This is the uncle of the Grand Caliph. A lavish mansion adjoining the Hall of Commanders, the abode of Prince Cheddah is a study in bad taste. From the outside it appears to be merely a rather rich mansion. On the inside, one finds the trinkets and decorations of a man who has no real understanding of fashion or art. The furnishings, while expensive, grate on those with a true taste for the finer things in life. Still, invitations from the Prince are usually accepted, as he employs one of the best chefs in the palace. Cheddah's library is also filled with complete statistics of the royal navy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">7. Chamber of Judges</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Within these three chambers, qadi hear the most important case of the Enlightened Cities. Five to ten qadi are on duty at any time, in order to have your case heard by the Grand Caliph, you must face these judges. Judgments are rendered swiftly. The qadi can call on magical aid if needed, to determine the truth of the matter. In spite of the fact that only the most important cases are heard here, the courtrooms are always full, and the caseload is staggering. In addition to the qadi themselves, servants, scribes, and two platoons of the Valiant are on duty here.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">8. Hall of the Courtiers</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The scribes, bureaucrats, and courtiers necessary for the day-to-day running of the palace work and live in this hall. Accommodations are good, and the. food is excellent. All of the hundreds of occupants consider themselves overworked, because they are.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">9. The Inner Treasury & Counting House</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This building is a constant hub of activity. Tax collectors from the harbor and the gates return here with the day's collections. All tax records are kept here, as is the actual money collected. Four tasked guardian genies, loyal to the Grand Vizier, provide security for the funds that support the Grand Caliph, the Navy, and the palace and city guard. An enormous amount of money flows through here; an average day?s collection can amount to 50,000 dinars or more.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The treasury is guarded by magic as well. All exits have walls of force  that may be activated by a command word. They are also activated if the gong at the front gate is sounded. In spite of this, the treasury has been robbed several times. In all but one case the thieves were trapped inside, and a contingent of the flying legion finished them off. The only successful robbery occurred a year ago, when a scribe employed here embezzled over 10,000 dinars and headed for parts unknown. A reward of 5,000 dinars has been offered, and several adventuring groups have set out on the trail to try to earn it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">10. Gate of Revelation</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The real entrance to the palace, the Gate of Revelation is even more beautiful than the Gate of Delights. The gates themselves are made of what appears to be marble, but it is shot through with pink and red streaks. Using dao, skilled earth mages have altered the stone so that the streaks depict the first Grand Caliph finding the scrolls of the Loregiver. A pair of broad towers with gold domes flank the gates, and a silver awning covers the walkway to the gate itself.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This gate is guarded by 50 mamluks at all times, all of 5th level or higher. A pair of mages and a priest are also on duty. Visitors to the palace are questioned about their business. If a visitor looks suspicious, his answers may be magically tested. Much traffic moves through here, so only strangers are rigorously questioned, while a recognized servant of the palace must merely state his destination and the guards wave him through.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The gate is also enchanted and is proof against any destructive spell, including disintegrate and earthquake. If the gate is physically attacked, a dao is summoned to defend it. The dao has maximum hit points and appears as soon as the gate is more than one-fourth damaged.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The towers provide good spots for crossbowmen. They are also a fine place to drop boulders on attackers. One of the top floors in each tower is devoted solely to an apparatus similar to a catapult. Its only purpose is to roll a rather large boulder down to land just in front of the gates. This protection has never been used, although it has been tested, once.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The captain of the Gate of Revelations is Aziz min Hajama, (dmP/m/14), who takes his position very seriously. Visitors who arouse suspicion may face an interview with the Commander himself. He generally carries many divination spells, trusting to his numerous magical items to protect him. He wears  bracers AC 2, a ring of djinni summoning, boots of striding  and  leaping,  and carries a  staff of the serpent while on duty. If Aziz is suspicious, he'll be quick to use detect lie  or even  true seeing,  if necessary.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">11. Quarters and Day Rooms - Imperial Guard</p>

<p class="regtxt9">These are the quarters for most of the imperial guard, including bunks, a lounge, a meeting hall for announcements of patrols and duties, and a very busy kitchen. Over 600 men and women, mostly mamluks of the Valiant, the Faithful, the Honored, and the Dauntless, have their quarters here. Aziz has his small utilitarian quarters in this area as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">12. The Throne Room</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This is the "official" throne room of the Grand Caliph. It is embossed with many fine paintings, covered with gold, and inlaid with turquoise. Here the Grand Caliph conducts official reception for visiting dignitaries and hands down judgments on those cases important enough to merit his personal attention. It is little more than a large meeting room with several smaller preparation and sitting rooms. The throne is enchanted; the true ruler of the kingdom cannot be deceived while sitting on it. The Grand Caliph is not fond of this hall, considering his duties here are some of the more onerous of being the Grand Caliph.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">13. Grand Vizier's Office and Library</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Here Alyana al-Azzazi conducts business and oversees the doings of the palace and the land. Her prime responsibility is the magical security of the palace and the Grand Caliph. Alyana is assisted by four wizards, all female. These assistants include Zobeida bint Maneira (hfW/so/13), an adept at warding magic, Samia al-Kasir (efW/wm/14), Alyana's former apprentice, Wadi'a bint Sali (gnfW/sh/11), served by Ladok, a fire gen, and Latifa ibn-Morim (hefW/sam/13), given charge of security within the ranks of the guard.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Grand Vizier's offices are busy throughout much of the day and far into the night, as the Grand Caliph's penchant for wandering the streets in disguise causes great anguish. Many times the Grand Caliph is followed by an invisible mage when he makes his visits to the city, but as often he eludes any pursuit and wanders unprotected. Even though the house is empty at night, all of the mages have small amulets that signal if the front gong is sounded, or if the Gate of Revelation is attacked. They can teleport into the hall and emerge laden with magical firepower.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In addition to her trusted lieutenants, the Grand Vizier is served by over 50 scribes and bureaucrats, for she also considers herself in charge of security for Huzuz and all of the Grand Caliph's holdings in the Land of Fate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">14. The Court of Grandeur</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Third Court is one that only the privileged may visit. It is large and filled with flowers and climbing vines. Scattered about the court are statues of the past Grand Caliphs, all works of master artists. The statues vary in material and size. The statue of the first Grand Caliph is made of imported jade, the current Grand Caliph's father is done in solid gold. All of the statues are priceless. They are scattered about in bowers where visitors to the palace may walk and enjoy the works. Many low benches and private meeting spots are located in the Third Court; it is a favorite place for lovers in the palace to conduct after-dark meetings. Most of the clearings and bowers are enchanted to prevent eavesdropping, while some relay the conversation to a horn located in the Grand Vizier's office.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The rarest flowers in the Land of Fate grow here, cared for by priests of Selan. The Grand Caliph's latest joy is a perfect jade orchid, never before seen and priceless. The priests also watch over two young singing trees (see Area 36, the Public Gardens, as well as the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM? sheets in this set, and the legends in Chapter 5 of  Golden Huzuz  for more information on singing trees).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">15. Grand Vizier's Scholars, Scribes, and School</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Here Alyana trains selected scholars and students. She has little time for this, but she still lectures at least twice a week. Students are expected to pledge for five years, and Alyana accepts only female sorcerers or wind and sand mages. They are put to work during the morning and are allowed to study during the afternoon. Most also take a patrol or serve at one of the gates every third night, The students are quartered in the school, while scribes and scholars reside in the Hall of Courtiers.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">16. Chambers of Imam Renn min-Zann, Keeper of the Mosques</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Even though he has larger chambers in the Golden Mosque, Imam Renn prefers to sleep here, closer to the Grand Caliph. The chambers are cluttered, the walls are filled with books, and every available surface is covered with problems and puzzles that the Imam is working on. Security is provided by a number of glyphs, magical traps, and a few mundane ones, like the stone block that drops on anyone who enters through any of the windows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">17. Vault of the Word of the Loregiver</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This vault contains the oldest copy of the Word of the Loregiver, said to have been copied by the first Grand Caliph personally. The scrolls are visible to all; walls of force allow visitors to see but not touch the scrolls. Many magical protection are laid over this vault. A tasked slayer genie is also imprisoned in the base of the stand upon which the scrolls rest. He is freed if the scrolls are stolen; he has been there for a very long, very irritating
time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">18. Hall of the Treasury</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Here the wealth of Zakhara is stored. The treasury is one of the more heavily guarded areas in the palace. A patrol of 20 mamluks circles the building at all times, two dao nobles are on guard in the actual vault, and priests of Jisan are responsible for keeping track of the treasure and dispensing it  for palace business.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The treasury is filled with many magical traps; only the Grand Vizier, the Grand Caliph, and the Keeper of the Treasury know them all. The Keeper, Ala'i ibn-Hasim (dmW/sh/12), has accepted a binding geas, so that he can never misuse any of the funds  that enter the treasury, nor can he betray the Grand Caliph in any way. The Keeper is fond of paralysis glyphs, and those who do not have legitimate business in the treasury are likely to stiffen up after only a few steps.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The actual treasure that is stored here is often well over a million dinars in value. This does not include priceless treasures and relics of the Grand Caliph's family, nor the jewels he wears each Ascension day. Ala'i orders the funds kept in smaller, separate vaults. Each is guarded by glyphs, traps, and guardians. In this manner thieves have to penetrate multiple vaults, minimizing the chance of a huge haul. The most guarded of these small vaults is the one wherein the crown jewels and trappings of office are stored.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Most funds are kept in ordinary vaults, still protected, but accessible to anyone who knows the proper command words. Most of Ala'i's staff can enter these vaults, it is here that most of the tax revenues are stored.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">19. Hall of the Pantry</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This large storage hall contains the foodstuffs for the palace. Several cold rooms are provided for keeping exotic fruits fresh, and even some for keeping things frozen. Since this represents the back of the palace proper, there is a side entrance to which deliveries can be brought. Two patrols of mamluks aided by a mage in the Grand Vizier?s service check all deliveries carefully.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">21. Servants and Slave Dormitories</p>

<p class="regtxt9">These long halls house the thousands of servants and slaves who work at the palace. Quarters are not lavish, but they are comfortable. Even the slaves at the Palace of the Great Lion are envied. Most servants prefer to spend their free time in the Court of Grandeur or visiting the town. There are several exits to the outside city, all guarded by patrols of ten mamluks. The mamluks are very familiar with those who use this gate. Anyone not looking or sounding exactly right is referred to the front gate or taken for questioning immediately.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">20. Bath Houses</p>

<p class="regtxt9">These are the bath houses for the majority of the palace folk. A large pool capable of holding over 200 people at a time is kept magically heated by two efreet controlling two fire elementals and four salamander slaves. The water replaces itself every five minutes, and it is magically cleaned and recycled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">33. Meditative Kiosk</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This place of solitude is used by
the Grand Caliph when he needs to be alone to think.
No outside noises can intrude here, as they are magically
shunted aside. There is no way of knowing exactly where
the noises go, but since it only applies to noises from the
outside of the kiosk, it is not a concern. The kiosk also
has entrances from the public gardens, and it is used by
many of the citizens of Huzuz for meditation and study.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">34. Jiraad's Personal Pool</p>

<p class="regtxt9">At the end of a long day of
court life, Jiraad often comes here to swim. The pool is
reserved for Jiraad alone, and most respect his wishes. It is
over 100 feet deep; at its base are some of Jiraad?s favorite
coral artworks. It is considered a rite of passage among the
young of the Court District to sneak a dip in Jiraad?s pool.
Jiraad knows about this, and he resents it. If he catches
someone, he curses them to breathe water only for the
next seven days. After a week of living at the bottom of a
pool, or in a bathtub, most young nobles do not have the
urge to try again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">35. Quarters of Ambassador Jiraad of the Marids</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The quarters of Jiraad are never locked. He keeps little of
great value here, but many items that are booby-trapped.
A prospective thief who thinks to make a moderate profit
on a venture here is likely to emerge covered with ink, his
hair a bright blue, no eyebrows, and no clothes. Jiraad
delights in magical pranks; an invader?s life is never in
danger but his dignity certainly is. Few are the thieves
with the stamina to reach Jiraad?s inner sanctum. This
area, guarded by a pair of jann, is where Jiraad stores the
crystal ball  that enables him to speak to any of the jann in
his service.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">36. Public Gardens: Also called the Fourth Court, the
public gardens are open to all of the citizens of Huzuz.
They are closed when the Grand Caliph wishes to walk in
them; this happens about once a week. When the Grand
Caliph wishes to use them, various enchanted pillars
begin speaking (via  magic mouth  spells), asking the public
to leave immediately. Most comply, but there have been
instances of assassins hiding in the gardens. One actually
succeeded in attacking the Grand Caliph, but was slain
by Jiraad himself. Since that day, a troop of jann precede
the Grand Caliph into the garden, ushering any lingerers
out.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The gardens contain many wonderful trees and flowers,
all kept blooming and flowering the entire year. Priests of
Selan, along with a troop of avid gardeners, keep the
garden fresh and lovely. The famous Singing Tree and
Talking Bird rest here, near a fountain of the Golden
Water  (see the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM? sheets
in this set, as well as Chapter 5 in Golden Huzuz).</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Talking Bird sometimes answers questions, flying
down from his lofty perch only when summoned by the
Grand Caliph or when a humble and truly needy
individual seeks his advice. The leaves of the Singing
Tree sing great choruses, a thousand voices in perfect
harmony. It is not unusual to see one of the Singing Tree?s
leaves fluttering through any part of the garden, leaving a
beautiful melody in its wake. The palace?s Singing Tree is
one of great age and power, and its leaves may travel
many yards from the tree, spreading beautiful music
through the public gardens.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">One of the greatest wonders of the gardens is the gift of ambassador Jiraad, who used his special powers to augment the already wondrous  Golden Water. A fountain in the center of the public gardens consists of many rotating floating bowls of crystal. The fountain continually creates new effects with the falling of the water, as the crystal bowls cavort through the air. Whenever anyone is near, the fountain plays soft music as accompaniment to the voices of the Singing Tree, and many who come to the garden spend hours watching and listening to the fountain of the Golden Water  and the leaves of the Singing Tree.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The garden is another place beloved by the people of Huzuz, who would sooner walk naked into the desert than steal from it, or help someone who has stolen from it. The number of people in the garden makes it difficult for a thief to steal anything, and most items are traceable (for instance, Jiraad can trace any misappropriated  Golden Water  from the fountain).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">37. Hall of Ashes: Here are interred the remains of
the former Grand Caliphs, at least all of those who died
in Huzuz. Two of the Grand Caliphs died fighting wars in
other cities, and their remains were not recovered. Each
has his own urn, made of pure red gold. This hall is open
to the public, but the actual resting places of the Grand
Caliphs are protected by  walls of force.  Seven picked
mamluks are on duty here at all times. Each is at least
10th level and uses magical armor and weapons. Most
people believe that a terrible curse will befall anyone who
robs the Hall of Ashes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">38. Crematorium</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This area is closed except during
funerals. There is room for up to 100 mourners, and the
fire is provided by a noble efreet summoned for the
occasion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">39. Prince Tannous?s Residence</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Prince Tannous has
always pandered to the Grand Caliph?s interests, and his
quarters reflect that fact. He has many items he has
acquired, some rare and valuable, that he intends to
bestow on the Grand Caliph at appropriate times. Hidden
in a secret compartment in his sleeping chambers
Tannous keeps the formulas that he has acquired for his
longevity potions. This is guarded by a simple poison
needle trap, as Tannous does not trust the mages of the
palace. They all serve the Grand Vizier, and he would not
let her into his quarters.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">40. Gates of the People</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Common citizens enter the public gardens through this gate. There are mamluks on
guard, but they are not there to keep anyone out, unless
the Grand Caliph wants to use the gardens. At such time
the guards are doubled, and a mage and a priest are also
on duty at each gate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">41. Gate of the Mamluks</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Here the guards and
mamluks enter and leave the palace. The security here is
as stiff as any gate into the palace, the mamluks guard
their home well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">42. Detention and Private Execution Chamber</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Those prisoners who are bound over for a hearing by the
Grand Caliph are detained in this cell. If the prisoner is
to be executed, the sentence may be carried out here as
well. No magic works in this room, so the mamluk guards
of the Honored have no trouble restraining important
prisoners.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">43-46. Living Quarters of the Honored</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The elite
society of eunuch guards live and train here. Their leader,
Ahmahd abd al-Iffa has his quarters here and trains daily
with his troops. The Honored have different interests;
lacking an interest in women, they turn their drive to
excellence in combat. The training room is always filled
with off-duty mamluks, honing their skills even further.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">47. Quarters of the Treasurer</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ala'i ibn-Hasim lives
here in very lavish quarters. Ala?i receives a good salary,
which he spends on art and golden treasures. Ala?i has a
keen eye for things of value. The worth of his personal
belongings has to be over 100,000 dinars. His quarters are
guarded by an ogre giant, a personal friend of his from his
adventuring days.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">48. Quarters of the Chamberlain</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The chamberlain of
the palace is here seldom, as pressing duties keep her busy
most of the day. Sitt Rahmah al-Zahir, the Grand Caliph?s
favorite maternal aunt, has her quarters here. She also has
several message rings  and a  crystal ball  that she uses to keep
in contact with her underlings in the Soft Whisper
brotherhood. The quarters are always guarded by ladies-
in-waiting, who appear to be servants, but are actually
holy slayers of the Soft Whisper, levels 5-7.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">49. Royal Gate</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Here the Grand Caliph and his most
valued guests exit the Grand Caliph?s private apartments.
The gate is guarded by a contingent of the Honored and
the Dutiful. Two mages, both with flying carpets and magical wands, guard the gate as well. The gate is a
wonder of magic, for while it is made of stone, it parts like
a curtain before the Grand Caliph. It can be commanded
to do so as well, but for the Grand Caliph it does so
automatically.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">50. Harim Gate:  This is supposedly the only entrance
to the harim. It is guarded by a contingent of the
Honored, mamluks of at least 10th level, eunuchs all.
When the Grand Caliph is in the harim, his personal
bodyguard, Saleem ibn Ahogar is also on guard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">51-59, 63-64. The Harim: Since the Grand Caliph
has over 100 wives, and all of them have slaves and
servants, the harim is of necessity one of the largest areas
in the palace grounds. There is a large dormitory (area
57) where the servants and slaves sleep in comfortable
accommodations.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The dormitory overlooks the harim court, where
female priests of Selan care for the gardens. Many of the
Grand Caliph?s wives enjoy gardening?some of the
beautiful flowers on display in the public gardens were
developed here. Huram and Garil, tasked harim servant
genies, work constantly to ensure the comfort of the
women of the harim.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">On the other side of the court, nearest the Grand
Caliph?s quarters, are the apartments of the women of
beloved status. Currently there are four. The apartment of
Tanya bint Perijan is one of the most sumptuous in all of
Huzuz. A third tasked harim servant genie, Nusaril, works
to keep these areas in good shape.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The harim court contains a secret tunnel, known to
almost everyone in the harim and to no one else. A few
of the wives and servants smuggle in men, usually in
women?s clothes. They are sometimes aided in these
endeavors by Garil, one of their tasked genies. The
eunuch mamluks patrol the harim and the court
constantly, although a man dressed as a servant or slave
can probably get past a patrol.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The harim has its own kitchen, staffed with women
cooks and servants only, as well as a matronly female
tasked harim servant genie, Lufala. Since each of the
wives is a noble, the kitchen is expected to be able to
prepare exotic repasts at all hours of the day and night.
Tara?a, a female tasked artist genie, with her specialty in
cooking, is responsible for the quality of the fare served
here, so it is no wonder that the Grand Caliph often takes
his meals with his wives.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">60-62. The Hospital: With thousands of servants,
hundreds of guards, and dozens of guests and visitors, the
palace is like a small city. And in a small city, people get
ill or hurt. A staff of ten priests and barbers minister to
those of ill health. The hospital is not large; it can
comfortably sleep no more than 30. In times of troubles,
more beds can be brought in. Guest quarters are also used.
The priests naturally memorize mostly healing spells.
Their leader, Bahija al-Kesir min-Kor (hfP/p/12) always
has raise dead, heal, cure disease, and neutralize poison in
memory, as do several of her underlings. One never knows
when a potential fatal accident may occur, but the
hospital is always prepared. In point of fact, they spend
more time treating guards who have hurt themselves in
training than anything else. Bahija is an expert midwife
and is prepared to attend any of the Grand Caliph?s wives
if they give birth. The hospital also has its own kitchen.
Unfortunately, even in the palace of the Grand Caliph,
hospital food is never as good or as flavorful as one would
hope.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">65. Grand Caliph?s Court:  This is the Grand Caliph?s
private court. Here he takes his ease, away from the
pressures of palace life. The court has several of his
favorite gifts, a chair that lets him block out the noise of
the city, a lyre that plays songs on command, and a small
fountain of  Golden Water  that revives tired feet when
they are soaked within.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">It is here that the Grand Caliph meets his friends for
refreshments and relaxation. A detachment of the Valiant
stands guard here at all times; this is considered very good
duty. The court is enchanted so that the weather is always
fair, and magical wards prevent entry from above. An
intruder thinking to land in the Grand Caliph?s private
court will first fly through a zone of anti-magic, which may
cause problems with whatever means he was using to fly.
This is followed by a powerful avoidance  spell, sufficient to
keep any nonintelligent flying creatures, such as
hippogriffs out. Intruders who make it by those defenses
are met by a dozen jann, who are always on guard.
Defeating the jann would only expose the intruder to the missile attacks of the mamluks on the ground, plus
whatever help may have shown up by then.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">66. Grand Caliph?s Salon</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Here the Grand Caliph
entertains honored guests and has small state dinners.
The entire theme of the room is blue and silver, a change
from the gold that decorates the rest of the palace. The
Grand Caliph prefers to have private discussions here,
knowing it is proof against any form of magical scrying.
The walls are decorated with weapons and trophies from
the Grand Caliph?s adventuring days. His proudest trophy
is the horns of a yak-man, one he defeated personally. He
always refers to these trophies as ?things of my wild
youth,? but it is believed that he still adds to this
collection from time to time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">67. Antechamber</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Those with appointments are
allowed to wait in comfort here. The room is kept
magically cool. Fine spirits and tidbits are served to those
who wait.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">68-69. Quarters and Dining Area of the Grand
Caliph?s Sons</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This area is currently unused.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">70.Oratory/Music Room</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Always a lover of music,
about once a week the Grand Caliph has a command
performance. This is a very sought-after spot, with
selection of the artists being up to the Chancellor. The
room is perfect, acoustically, and anyone in any of the 50
seats can hear as though they were sitting in the Grand
Caliph?s divan. Musicians would give almost anything to
perform here, for after performing for the Grand Caliph, a
musician can get a job anywhere in Huzuz. While the
Chancellor prefers artists from the noble families, the
Grand Caliph often surprises her by asking for someone
by name. The infamous Gorar, the singing barber of the
Grand Bazaar, has performed here over a dozen times,
always at the Grand Caliph?s request.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">71. Heir?s Anteroom</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Unused at this time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">72. Baths</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Honored guests and ranking officials use
these baths. The baths are heated by two salamanders,
under the control of an efreet. These individuals are paid
rather than enslaved; this and generous tips from guests
insure their diligence and the comfort of all who visit.
Skilled masseurs are available, and guests are truly made
to feel honored.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">73. Guest Quarters (Most Respected Guests)</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Important guests must be made to feel important. Each of
these suites is provided with a dozen servants, magical
wards (cast at the time the guest enters, only the guest
knows the command words), and very luxurious living
quarters. The beds are magically soft. Some of the fine
sculptures and tapestries the Grand Caliph receives are
on display here. The Grand Caliph feels it is an act of
trust and honor to quarter his guests in a suite with
thousands of dinars worth of art objects.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">74. Hall of the Hearth</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Anyone entering this room,
quarters for the efreet of the palace, is struck by a blast of
heat. The temperature in this room is sufficient to cause
normal clothing to smolder, while paper bursts into flame.
The center of the room is occupied by a large firepit, with
four salamanders laboring to keep the fire hot enough. It
is scented with the exotic minerals that the efreet like so
well, and it also serves as home to a number of fire snakes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">75. Hall of Earth</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The nobles of the dao that serve the
Grand Caliph are quartered here. The air is dry, and the
dao have both lesser dao and pech servants in abundance.
No one but the Grand Caliph knows exactly how many
dao are quartered here, but in times of danger a dozen can
respond almost instantly, usually with a few sandlings at
their heels.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">76. Hall of the Fountain</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This room is kept filled with
water, but by a special enchantment, the water does not
come rushing out of the room when the doors are opened.
There are seldom more than a dozen marids in residence;
others are out serving the Grand Caliph or visiting the
Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls. A number of nereids and
water weirds cavort in the water as well, helping serve the
great marids.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">77. Golden Road?The Ascension Hall</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The
crowning of the Grand Caliph takes place here, as does
the annual ceremony honoring his ascension each year.
The Golden Road is truly lined with gold, and statues of
ivory and alabaster line the road. By tradition, the heros
of the Enlightened Throne are depicted here, though the
current Grand Caliph has yet to add a new statue to the
road. He intends to put up one to the White Agate, as did
his father.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">78. The Cage</p>

<p class="regtxt9">An enchanted prison is necessary for
speaking to hostile mages, genies, and priests. This
magical cage is warded by walls of force.  In addition, no
spells or spell-like abilities work in this area. Here the
Grand Caliph can safely question important and powerful
prisoners. Any time there are prisoners within the cage, a
patrol of the Dutiful, as well as a sha?ir and several genies,
are on guard as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">79. The Hall of Winds</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The quarters of the djinn
serving the Grand Caliph are indeed a hall of winds. The
winds blow constantly, circling within the tower. The
tower is 80 feet tall, and the djinn can ride the winds up
and back down, floating on the gale force winds. A team
of sylphs and aerial servants release exotic scents into the
winds whenever there are djinn present.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">80. Antechamber for the Inner Throne</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This is the
waiting chamber for those honored enough to be granted
a private audience with the Grand Caliph. Visiting
dignitaries are summoned from their quarters a short time
before the Grand Caliph is ready to see them. Merchants
and nobles of Huzuz may show up several hours before an
appointment; it would never do to be late. The finest
wines and fruits are served to those who wait. At the
same time, a mage, a priest, and a genie are all magically
inspecting the visitor. The door to the Grand Caliph?s
private throne room is guarded by two members of the
Honored and two picked jann warriors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">81. Grand Caliph?s Bed Chamber</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Grand Caliph
once complained that his bed chambers were large
enough to hold a camel race. While this is stretching
things a bit, the bed chamber of the Grand Caliph is
indeed large and lavish. Dozens of valuable gems, statues,
woodcarvings, and tapestries line the walls. Here he keeps
his favorite gifts. When they begin to tire him he donates
them to the Museum of Wonders or the hall of curiosities.
The bed seems odd at first, until the viewer realizes that
there are no legs. The Grand Caliph sleeps on a bed of
air, an enchantment granted by the Caliph of the Djinn.
This is indeed comfortable, but the Grand Caliph always
complained that he could never get to sleep, lying there
on nothing. The problem was solved by placing fine silk
sheets and pillows on the bed, giving it the appearance of
a real bed without the form.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The room also contains a couch that does not fit with the rest of the room?s finery. This small, simple couch is
where the Grand Caliph actually sleeps on those nights
when he just cannot get to sleep on the bed of air.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The quarters are always guarded by a pair of jann
bodyguards. When the Grand Caliph is sleeping, his
personal jann is present as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">82. The Grand Caliph?s Private Library</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Grand
Caliph is not a voracious reader, but he loves stories of
adventure and heroic rescues. His collection of epic tales
is perhaps the largest in Huzuz. The Grand Vizier has
learned to watch for the signs?if the Grand Caliph
begins to spend a lot of time reading, he?s getting restless.
He will soon be taking off, either on one of his nightly
strolls through the city or risking his life on an adventure
out of the city. The library also contains many books of
history and politics, because as the Grand Caliph has
matured he has realized the need to study his allies and
his enemies. The walls are covered with maps of Zakhara
and the surrounding lands, some of them are very
valuable works of art in their own right.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">83. The Grand Caliph?s Private Dining Chamber</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This is a small dining chamber with an elegant oak table
at the center. Oak is almost unknown in Huzuz, and the
table is imported all the way from Lantan. It was a gift
from the Caliph of Wasat. Though it seats only a dozen,
the Grand Caliph prefers to eat here. The Grand Vizier,
the Keeper of the Mosques, the Chancellor, and the
Keeper of the Treasury usually join him for supper. All of
these people have a standing invitation, unless the Grand
Caliph must entertain a visiting dignitary. Dinners are
served by purple silk-clad janns, who are extremely good
at anticipating the Grand Caliph?s desires.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">84. The Inner Throne</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Notwithstanding the official
throne (area 12) of the palace, this is the throne on
which the Grand Caliph is comfortable. The throne is
teak, and it has been used by the Grand Caliphs for five
generations. It is enchanted so that one who sits upon
this throne is immune to all enchantment and charm
magic, of any nature.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The throne is padded with the finest silk pillows, and
the Grand Caliph?s head rests upon satin. The chair is
inlaid with precious emeralds, sapphires, and rubies.
Several of the gems on the arms have other uses. The
Grand Caliph can activate any one by touching it and
willing it to function. Five of them can summon aid.
There is one gem each for the marids (an emerald), dao
(a jacinth), djinn (a diamond), and efreet (a ruby). The
last, an onyx stone, summons jann and also sounds an
alarm in the quarters of the Honored.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Yet another gem enables the user to detect lie, and still
another cloaks the throne in an  anti-magic shell.  There is
gem that causes a 10-dice  lightning bolt  to fire. Another
gem causes a reverse gravity spell to take effect in a ten-
foot square in front of the throne.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Grand Caliph wants his guests to be comfortable,
so floating divans (none that float higher than the
throne) are available for the guests while they discuss
their business. The throne room is guarded by a patrol of
the Honored. This special guard has also volunteered to
have their tongues cut out so that they cannot repeat
what they hear. There are only four such guards present at
any time, but they all carry  scimitars +4  and are
specialized with them. None of the guards are less than
10th level. Their leader, Umar ibn-Damid (hmF/ml/20)
served the Grand Caliph?s father as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">85-86. Grand Caliph?s Private Bath: The Grand
Caliph bathes daily in this large private pool where he
can soak and relax. Several marids attend him while he
bathes, and other servants and guards are present as well.
Of late the Grand Caliph has developed a fondness for
jasmine, and the jann in charge of the bath is trying to
get as large a supply as he can. The heat for the bath is
provided by a pair of salamanders, under control of an
efreet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">87. Bed Chamber of the Heir Apparent: This is
unoccupied at this time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">88. Heir?s Salon and Instruction Room: The Grand
Caliph used to spend quite a bit of time here, preparing
for his heir. In the last few years he has avoided these
rooms, as they only serve to remind him of his failure.
Outside of regular cleaning by the servants, these rooms
are never used.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">89. Hanging Gardens of the Grand Caliph</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The
hanging gardens of the Grand Caliph are a tribute to the
combined efforts of the priests of Selan and the loyal jann
servants of the Grand Caliph. When the Grand Caliph assumed the throne, he did not want to do anything to
the fine gardens his father had established. Therefore, his
loyal jann servants came up with a way for him to keep
the garden and still add his own favorite flowers, shrubs,
and fruit trees. The gardens actually have two tiers, yet
both receive sunlight. There are key points about the
garden, known only to the Grand Caliph and those few
who may join him in the garden. By stepping into the air
at any of these points, the Grand Caliph may walk on an
invisible path, some 15 feet in the air. On this level grow
the Grand Caliph?s favorite roses and shrubs.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The gardens require constant magical care, but priests
and genies are always eager for the chance to serve here.
This area is magically protected from aerial intruders, just
as is the Grand Caliph?s court.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">90. Monument of the Achievements of the
Enlightened Throne</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This grand tower is the most
ambitious construction project the Grand Caliph has yet
embarked on. He wants a grand hall celebrating the
accomplishments of his forefathers. Not surprisingly, his
father and grandfather are to have the largest sections,
but all the Grand Caliphs are to be represented. A team
of dwarves and ogres, led by a tasked architect genie, is
assembling the tower. The Grand Caliph has charged his
aunt, the Chancellor, to sort through the various major
accomplishments of the past Grand Caliphs. She is to
commission artists to depict these accomplishments in
tapestries, dioramas, sculptures, and paintings. To date,
she has hardly made a start, although dozens of artists
have already been interviewed and tested. Several have
been selected, and the Grand Caliph intends to open the
monument on his next Ascension day. The one work that
has been completed is a wall-sized mural of the first
Grand Caliph finding the scrolls of the Loregiver.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">91. The Great Reflecting Pool</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This pool is accessible
from the public gardens. It is said to have magical
properties: if a person visits it with a clear question, the
answer may be seen. It is also said to reflect a person?s
inner soul, but only the person being reflected can see
this visage. The pool indeed has strange qualities, and
there is a base 1% chance that someone with a serious
problem or question will receive a vision that may help.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The part about reflecting the inner soul is one of
Jiraad?s pranks. He has set spells in certain popular
viewing places; at random intervals they may show a
viewer a different reflection. A courtesan may see herself
with a camel?s face, a merchant may see himself as a
destitute beggar. No one has yet attempted to dispel the
magical effects, but most spellcasters powerful enough to
recognize the magic place little stock in such tales, so
they haven?t tried it. A pair of marids reside in the pool,
both guarding it and keeping it clean. In times of great
indecision, the Grand Caliph himself visits the pool. His
chance to receive a helpful vision is 10%) and he never
sees his reflection as other than it is. Jiraad likes pranks,
but he knows better than to pull them on the Grand
Caliph.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">37. Kitchens and Cooks' Quarters</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Here reside the dozens of cooks and servants necessary to keep this large complex fed. Cooking here is considered the ultimate challenge. One day a cook may be in charge of feeding the hundreds of mamluks quartered here, the next she may be preparing an elegant feast for the Grand Caliph himself. The chief cook is Naaman al-Rima (hfF/a/0), an elderly halfling who devotes herself to seeing that the palace is well fed. She has a number of able assistants, but she always inspects the Grand Caliph's meals personally. The kitchens are huge, tumultuous places, busy the whole day and night through.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">38. Grand Vizier's Personal Quarters</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Connected to the school are the quarters of the Grand Vizier herself. Here Alyana conducts the secret business of the palace, for her quarters are shielded from scrying, as well as defended by an invisible djinn. The djinn, Mamaod, is sworn to serve Alyana for 100 years and a day. He was a gift from Jiraad, at the time Alyana took office.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Alyana has her not-inconsiderable treasure trove here, including many scrolls with defensive spells, several offensive wands, and two spare  flying carpets. Her bedroom hides an entrance to a tunnel that leads to the basement of the mosque of Hakiyah.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">39. Private Palace Mosque</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Here visitors to the palace can worship. Services are held  thrice daily. The Grand Caliph uses this mosque when his schedule prevents him from leaving the palace, though he prefers to worship at the Golden Mosque. His servants often do not have time to attend services at the Grand Mosques, so they worship here. The High Priest of the Palace, Halima min-Kor, (hfP/e/15), has served here for over 40 years, and she considers this her personal mosque. Halima is quartered in the Hall of Commanders. In the event of an attack on the palace, she is responsible for the priests in the Grand Caliph?s service. She is also in charge of security for the Vault of the Word of the Loregiver.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">40. Archive of Curiosities</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In this area visitors to the palace can admire some of the stranger gifts brought for the Grand Caliph. Included are many gifts from foreign lands and other cities of Zakhara, unique magical items that entertain and delight, and paintings and tapestries done by talented but unorthodox artists. Among the rarer items are a tapestry of a gold-bearded king in shining silver armor with a purple dragon emblazoned on his shield, a large jade chair donated by the Emperor of Shou Lung (too cold to sit on, and uncomfortable besides), the flag of a pirate ship taken by the Grand Caliph personally, a harp that plays exotic tunes upon command, and the like. The one item that the Grand Caliph does not have, and would really like, is a Halruaan skyship. He has made this desire known. Several merchant families, the mosques of Najm and Hajama, and the mamluk society called the Dauntless are all attempting to obtain such an item.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">41. Museum of Wonder</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A roofed terrace surmounts the wonders and achievements of the earlier Grand Caliphs. Each has his own section. The largest is that of the current Grand Caliph's father. Tapestries of important moments in each Grand Caliph's life hang about each section, as well as statues of the Grand Caliph and his favorite wife and plaques describing important proclamations and advancements. Any artistic achievements are noted as well. For instance, the 13th Grand Caliph was a fine woodcarver, and several of his works are on display.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A dozen jann are on duty here, as both guides and guards. Since this museum is located in the public gardens, many strange visitors pass through here. Theft is very uncommon; most natives of Huzuz would not even consider pillaging the Museum of Wonder. In fact, should such a thing happen, almost any citizen of Huzuz would turn the thief over to the guard in a moment. Such is the pride of the citizens in "their" palace that even a dealer in stolen goods will not handle something stolen from here. In fact, most would try to see the thief brought to justice. Such thieves often end up hoping for a long sentence, rather than risk release to an ugly crowd of citizens who would tear them to pieces in a moment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">42. Quarters of the Lotus Children</p>

<p class="regtxt9">These are the luxurious quarters for the children of the Empress. Imperial children are trained in the highest levels of military and social governorship. Those found unworthy are trained in other areas. The goal is to prevent them from seeking to damage the status quo. Any found to be untrainable are executed to prevent coup attempts and other anti-social behaviors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">43. Terrace and Bower</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This area is intended for use by the Lotus Children. It is a private area, filled with greenery and songbirds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">44. Fountain Pool</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A grand fountain, designed by one of the best architects of a hundred years ago, graces this lovely pool. Lilies float about the pool, while the water emerges in different colors from the four genie statues that make up the fountain. Each genie is fashioned of a different substance?silver, gold, marble, and clear crystal. Jiraad often comes here, for the beauty of the fountain has always struck a chord in his arrogant soul.</p>
