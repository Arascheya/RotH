<p class="pagecaption">Ajayib, City of Wonders</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The westernmost of the Pearl Cities, Ajayib is situated at the base of rising hills. The steep slopes have been terraced and cultivated into great gardens. Higher up, there are coffee plantations, and their harvest is famed throughout the Land of Fate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Ruler: Caliph Halima al-Wahsi (hfF/a/16) is a tall warrior-queen with a face more perfect than the brightest moon, eyes darker than the deepest well, a smile that, when given to a faithful follower, may set fabric on fire at fifty paces. Her long, thick hair hangs to the small of her back, and she wears it loose in court. In combat, she coils it into a tight, whip like braid. Yet it is not by her beauty that she rules Ajayib, for her mind and her sword are quick and sure. Halima is active in the day-to-day rule of her city, and she takes all decisions (and all comments) personally. But Halima is a warrior at heart, not a statesman. She enjoys nothing better than to ride out and do battle against the savages of the Al-Suqut Mountains, putting  off courtly bureaucracy for another day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Court: The two most important individuals in the caliph’s court are a priest and a genie. The priest is Imam Mojos al-Yunqani min Selan (hemP/e/12). He is 40 years the caliph’s senior, and often balances her passion and sense of adventure with a voice of relative reason. He would prefer that the caliph address matters of state as opposed to western savages. Imam Mojos keeps a careful eye on ambassadors from the other Pearl Cities, whom he considers a greater threat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The genie is a noble dao, Zaheb al-Zidq, the Righteous One, His Most Respected Majesty and Puissant Hetman of the Mighty Khan. The dao is apparently smitten by the caliph’s beauty. He is constantly at her side in court, composing bad doggerel and “protecting” her from the advances of other suitors. The caliph, in turn, treats the dao as a favorite pet. Given the natural tendency of dao toward humans, this is most unexpected, and it has been surmised that Zaheb is under some spell or charm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Whatever the true case, Zaheb is a combination of personal body guard, confidant, and enforcer. The caliph has no husbands, and Zaheb discourages all but the bravest of suitors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Population: 70,000.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Features of the City: The coffee, or mocha, of Ajayib is renowned throughout Zakhara for its dark, rich, powerful flavor. To the north of the city, the land dries out and becomes dotted with frankincense trees, from which resin harvesters also bring in rich rewards.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ajayib is known as the last stop for enlightened civilization. Beyond it to the west, the Al-Suqut Mountains plunge into the sea, creating a foreboding coastline-the hiding place of mad wizards, savage and inhuman tribes, and sea-going brigands. It is the gathering spot of the bold and brazen: adventurers preparing voyages to the south and west, civilized men who are weary of civilization, sorcerers seeking solitude, and criminals on the run.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The people of Ajayib are proud of their frontier nature. They are independent, strong-willed, and opinionated. Rich colors are common in their dress, though herders, coffee growers, and resin-gatherers prefer a duller and more utilitarian costume. Women and men may be veiled or not; this is a matter of personal choice as opposed to a community standard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Major Products: Coffee, fruits, frankincense and other aromatic gums, bright dyes, trade.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Armed Forces: 8,000 city guards; 2,000 cavalry; an elite unit of 300 1st-level farisan under the command of the caliph herself; six-ship navy used against western raiders.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Major Mosques: Jisan, Hakiyah, Selan, Zann.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rumors and Lore: Ajayib is where adventures begin and old legends come to die. It is the youngest of the Pearl Cities, having officially set up an enlightened mosque only a decade ago. The caliph is the second enlightened ruler of the city; the first perished in combat against the savages. Halima was one of her predecessor’s best officers, and stepped in to replace him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The local legends tell of another city which occupied this site in distant times, one built into the walls of cliffs overlooking Ajayib. This was said to be a dark and ruined place, looted and destroyed by civilized men generations ago. But, the legends say, the original survivors of this dark race still claw their way through the darkness, dreaming of revenge. The cliffs overlooking Ajayib are riddled with caverns and passages. No one has brought proof of the legends, though treasure-seekers still comb the cliffs for new discoveries.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Secrets:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ajayib sits on the border of the Al-Suqut Mountains and the wild lands to the west. It can be an outpost for heroes seeking adventure among these distant savage lands. In addition, the cliffs overlooking the city are riddled with caverns. Most of the nearby and easily-explored caves have been exhausted long ago by treasure hunters, but the more, remote caves still have passages leading farther into the darkness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These passages lead to communities of unenlightened duergar and drow. These races are as described in Volume Two of the Monstrous Compendium, and have little improved through the passage of time in their isolation. The duergar are almost bone-white from their long time in the dark, while the drow are as dark as polished ebony. Both races hate each other, but waylay any travelers into their realms, killing them or reducing them to slaves. The drow worship the savage god Ishra, while the duergar venerate the cold elemental god Grome.</p>
