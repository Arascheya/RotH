<p class="pagecaption">Lotus Empire History</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Lotus Empire formed from a small grouping of desert tribes. Some of these were the last of the Kharatoum Sultanate and others were nomadic tribes of the deep desert. A woman child came from the desert, escorting a blind seer. The seer spoke of a great empire to come, one that would span the desert and bring prosperity to the tribes that formed it. The seer spoke of enough things that the tribes came to believe her and they began to listen to the woman, the first calipha, of the empire. Once the path was set, the seer vanished in the night, never to be seen by that generation again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At various points the blind prophetess has come from the deep desert to speak of things that threaten the empire. She is always accompanied by a young woman of the <a href="../../eritsani_inx.htm">Eri'sa</a>, the desert wanderers.</p>
