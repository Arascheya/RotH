<p class="pagecaption">Lotus Empire - And the Hell gate Wars</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Lotus Empire was one of the hardest hit areas during the wars. Several cities near the <a href="../galhaiwaste.htm">Galhai Wastes</a> were abandoned after the wars and never rebuilt. Casualties ran in the tens of thousands. Only the assistance of <a href="../../npcs/irena_k.htm">Irena</a> and the <a href="../../../hut_online/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a> kept them from being even higher.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hell Gate Wars happened twenty years ago, so the effects and fall-out are still in the minds of many in the Empire. Almost everyone has been touched by the wars, either directly or by family members that were involved. Gathering basic information about Imperial involvement and stories of the battle is easy. Getting tactical particulars about objectives and covert operations is more difficult. Anyone involved does remember <a href="../../npcs/irena_k.htm">Irena</a> and her contributions.</p>
