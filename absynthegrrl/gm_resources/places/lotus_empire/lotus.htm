<p class="pagecaption">Lotus Empire</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Empire of the Blessed Lotus (Lotus Empire)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ruled by the Calipha Alia ni Sharazar ni Ishala, Gem of the Lotus, Most High Empress of the Light, Defender of the Faithful, Sweet Spring of Bountiful Goodness this empire is a chaotic melange of many tribal bands that joined together long ago under the protection of the first Calipha. Since then the power has remained a matriarchy with the new Calipha recognizable by a lotus blossom birthmark. It is said a girl child is born with this mark at the exact time of the previous Lotus Mother’s death. The current Calipha takes the new daughter into the palace and grooms her for her ascension to the Lotus Throne. At the new Calipha’s 21st birthday the old Calipha retires to the duties of Lotus Mother and the reigns of state power pass.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Lotus Mother is the high priestess of the state religion, the Multiple Paths to Life and Fulfillment through the Revelations of the Holy Lotus. She over-sees the spiritual power of the Empire. It is referred to as the Lotus Cult by many. This cult consists of several sections, called Petals by its followers. There are eight basic parts with each part corresponding to a different color, see list below.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Black- Secret Police/assassins</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Red-   basic military</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Yellow-Imperial Elites</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Purple-controlling priesthood- these are the spiritual leaders of each community and often the actual policy makers of their community</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Gold-  royal family- the empress is considered the incarnation of the Mother Lotus and her word is law to all members of the cult and empire. She has direct control of all other factions of the Lotus Cult and is thought to have her own private band of assassins to ensure the loyalty of her court</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Silver-traders and merchants</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Green- farmers and general population</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Blue-  scribes and clerks, similar to Thoql</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Orange-  nomadic <a href="../../eritsani_inx.htm">Eri'sa</a> (the wanderers), the non-settled, and the mystics. This branch is popular among the tribes of the deep desert and the Galhai Wastes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Other cults are accepted in most areas of the empire as long  as their membership stays low and they keep a relatively low profile. Members of the ruling elite and various state bureaucracies must appear to the public as members of the Lotus Cult. They may choose to retain affiliations with their previous religion as long as no conflict of interest or impropriety can be attached to them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Forgotten Gods: (from Lands of Fate) - these are some of the other deities worshiped in the Empire.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">The great river empires of Nog and Kadar worshipped their own deities, allegedly through foul and inhuman rites. Crumbling edifices and statues erected in honor of those gods still litter the Ruined Kingdoms. While little is remembered about these deities, the following have been identified:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Kiga, the Predator, who commanded a pride of female were-leopards.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Ishra, a human-headed spider venerated by evil elves who were burned alive for their sins.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">The FleshFeaster, an assassin in the night that kills and eats randomly through-out the dark nights when the moons are near-dark. This one was used to scare children and as a threat to anyone trying to use the night for cover.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Social Structure</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The social structure is based on a caste system with the usual labels:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">lowest- Untouchables</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Slaves</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Farmers and regular Army personnel</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Merchants, regular Army officers, and Imperial Elite troopers</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Nobles, Imperial Elite officers, and Regional Governors</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Imperial family and priests of the Lotus Cult</p>

<p class="regtxt9">highest-The Empress</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This caste system is fairly flexible with movement up and down the chain possible based on personal merit, or lack there-of.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are other empires and states to the west of the empire. To the east is the area known as the Galhai Wastes, beyond which is a large mountain range and several smaller city/states who trade sporadically with the eastern reaches of the empire.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Women dominate this society, holding most of the power and prestige. Men are not badly treated, just considered to be the weaker willed and skilled of the populace. Men are most likely to be regular troops, household retainers, and laborers. Women make the decisions and hold the power.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Women would tend to go to a brothel to find a temporary companion. Men would need to find a willing mistress. There are rumors of drugs that will bring a man to instant readiness, kind of a reverse date rape drug, however no one has actually seen it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Woman-Woman marriages are common. In these cases a trusted male is used to impregnate one or both when children are desired. This is often a male member of one or the other families of the women involved. Women and men may marry and it will confer a bit of protection to assets held by the couple in the case of death of the woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are two primary groups ni the Empire. The Landed, those that live in villages and cities and remain mostly stationary, and the nomadic <a href="../../eritsani_inx.htm">Eri'sa</a>, the wanderers. They make their living from the desert, wadis, and oases across the vastness of the desert.</p>
