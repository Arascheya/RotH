<p class="pagecaption">Halwa, City of Solitude</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Located about 200 miles east of Wasat and Suq Bay, Halwa is one of the Lotus Empire's few major inland settlements. The city is perched on a lonely bluff overlooking the dry bed of the Wadi Malih. With the onset of spring, melting snow from the Ghost Mountains combines with seasonal downpours, turning the wadi into a surging, muddy torrent that washes silt into the low lands. Within a month, the rains subside and the arid waste quickly returns.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Ruler:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Calipha Havala al-Gatil (hmF/a/12) is a well-meaning but insulated ruler. Her main concern appears to be writing her memoirs. Al-Gatil often cloisters herself with her favored scribes, writing (and rewriting) her past exploits as a young warrior, dwelling on those blithe days before she took her mother's place as calipha. Al-Gatil delegates most of her responsibility to her chief vizier, whom she trusts above all. The calipha has three beautiful daughters, Sikayah, Rajiyah, and Mahabbiyah, triplets who are approaching the age of majority. While the calipha appears to care for them, the depth of her devotion has never been tested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Court:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The court consists of Chief Vizier Zaradya (hmW/sh/15) and her flunkies. Zaradya has served Al-Gatil since the caliph was a child, and she continues to maintain a strangle hold on the calipha's mindset. All of the calipha's orders come through Zaradya. And if Zaradya happens to add her own orders, who would deny they're the truth? Zaradya has already made a great fortune through unfair taxation (which she imposed in the name of the calipha and removed two years later in the name of the calipha, without the calipha herself ever detecting it). Now Zaradya lusts after even greater power.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The chief vizier is served by a dao of maximum hit points, who is referred to solely as "Zaradya's Pet" (and then only in hushed voices). Zaradya herself is easy to identify in court: she always wears black-and-white striped robes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Population:  60,000.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Features of the City:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Despite its isolation, Halwa is bustling little city, serving as a chief trading post between settled Lotusans and the desert-dwellers of the Haunted Lands. Both city and wilderness people mingle on the streets. Abas and keffiyehs are more common than caftans and dolmans, and many of Halwa's merchants have relatives among the desert tribes.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Halwa's calipha is permissive, allowing all activity that does not bring disgrace upon her wise and beneficent rule. An underground slave trade thrives here, and Halwa is a stopping place for caravans enroute to Hiyal. Similarly, adventurers and would-be heroes use the city as a starting place for expeditions into the Haunted Lands, where many a man and woman has perished in the search for legendary riches.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">As a group, the people of Halwa are known for their haggling skill and sharp-witted dealing. "Never give what can be sold" is their motto, and that applies to favors and information as well as camels and figs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Major Products:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Trade, livestock, slaves, durable goods.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Armed Forces:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">3,000 woman city guard; 500 woman palace guard; 1,000 woman mercenary cavalry, hired from desert tribes on five-year contracts. In addition, Zaradya has her own 200 woman personal guard. ?NA - In times of need, she apparently can call upon a tribe of 200 jann.?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Major Mosques:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Hajama, Haku, Jisan, Najm, and Selan. Haku has the largest and most opulent temple, which is a pilgrimage site for the desert tribesmen. A three-day religious festival in Jisan's name is held on the first clear day after the spring rains.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rumors and Lore:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Zaradya is said to be everywhere, running the city with a smooth but iron-willed determination. This chief vizier hates nothing more than disturbances of her pleasant and (to her mind) just rule, and any problems that arise are dealt with quickly and harshly. She is not above selling an enlightened person into slavery (sometimes by producing a "previous owner" who declares the accused escaped her). Of course, this violates the Law, but Zaradya places herself above the Law. Only her marriage to the calipha's eldest daughter will establish her fully as the city's ruler. Sikayah is technically the eldest, for she was born just before her sisters.</p>
