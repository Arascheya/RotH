<p class="pagecaption">Evaya's Oasis</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Evaya's Oasis is a small village in the Ghost Mountains, just off the <a href="lotus_geo.htm">Kharatoum Habaya</a>. The village is a series of caves with mud brick front walls, facing a small seep of water. This seep provides almost enough water for the livestock and plants necessary to sustain the village. It is supplemented by a series of wind traps in the deeper caves that collect water from the prevailing winds. This is the best water, sweeter than the seep, and kept for drinking. Think of a fremen sietch from Dune for the concept of living quarters.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Evaya's Oasis is part of the distant Lotus Empire. While distant from it, the basic principles of it apply to village life. The village is ruled by Dirayat, a woman who arrived in the village after the Hell gate Wars, which ended about twenty years ago. She had been the aide to the Supreme Commander, Alucinia Tomarasdan, of the Lotus Empire forces and one of the few to survive the war. She left the military when the Supreme Commander surrendered her rank and disappeared into the streets of Jakara, capital city of the empire. Many have tried to get her story over the years, but she just smiles sadly and deflects their attempts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Caravans rarely come to Evaya's Oasis, so it is a festive day when the camels and small wagons slide into town. Caravans bring items of luxury and the necessities that connot be grown. They take away habyanisha carapaces, woven tapestries of goat hair, precious stones found deep in some of the caves, and trinkets found along the edges of the Kharatoum Habaya. These trinkets are believed to have come from the Kharatoum Empire, although there is never any real proof.</p>
