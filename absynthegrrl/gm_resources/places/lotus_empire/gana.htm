<p class="pagecaption">Gana, City Of Riches</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Like Jumlat to the northeast, Gana is a true "City of the Pearl" devoting five months each year to the pearl-fishing industry. Because this city also lies near the Realm of Bleeding Trees, its inhabitants can turn to the frankincense harvest when the pearling season has passed. Its people are generally wealthier than the residents of Jumlat. Even the lower classes of Gana are proud to call their home the City of Riches.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Ruler: Sultan Yusef bin Ahmad al-Wadi (hmF/a/15) known as "Yusef the Just" for his wisdom in matters of the law. This venerable ruler encourages trade and industry in his city. He discourages power from concentrating in anyone else’s grasp for an extended period of time. As a result, talented individuals, adventurers, and merchants continually pass through his court, with few of them remaining there long.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Court: The only permanent member of Al-Wadiís court is his chief vizier, a human sea mage named Alíia bint-Hazir (hfW/sem/16). She has served at the sultan’s side for several decades. According to a well-known rumor, the sultan once proposed marriage to her, but she responded that she would rather serve at his side than at his feet. The sultan has never married, nor has he officially recognized any of the sons and daughters from his harim (a matter which many find disgraceful). Rumor also says that Alíia has secretly borne Al-Wadi several sons over the years, and that she has spirited them away for training in far lands. Now as old and wizened as the sultan himself, Alíia continues to rule at his side. She often advises compassion over harsh justice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The position of chief judge has been held by a long series of people in short succession. Justice cannot be bought in Gana, but it can be rented for reasonable rates. As a result, when there is a scandal or outcry, the chief judge is quickly replaced (and banished). The smart judges serve about five years, then retire. The current chief judge is a dwarf named Ghaliyah bint Borga min Suq (dfP/h/10), Gala of the Marketplace. She has held her position for three years. While Ghaliyah can see the truth, she does not always speak it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finally, there is an honorary position within the court, awarded to those who complete the Great Task of the Pearl (see below). Such a position is usually temporary, lasting no more than a year, and may be surrendered voluntarily or upon the will of the sultan. A number of great heroes, male and female, have attached the sobriquet "Warrior of the Great Task" to their names, and served the sultan in this fashion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Population: 100,000.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Features of the City: In addition to its successful pearl business, Gana is Zakharaís trade center for frankincense and other aromatic gums that are harvested from the Realm of Bleeding Trees to the west. The wasteland in which the shrub like trees grow is good for little else. It is inhabited by herdsmen who bring the gum into Gana for trade.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gana has a looser control over its pearl trade than Jumlat; its captains are more independent and its merchant class is larger. The quality of captains ranges from fair to average (instead of harsh to horrid, as in Jumlat). Most of Ganaís captains practice the type of economic slavery that is common in Jumlat, but Gana also has a few progressive captains who practice more humane methods of pearl diving. There are even several cases in which Ganaís captains have retained a sea mage to cast airy water around the divers, allowing them to remain beneath the surface for prolonged periods without ill effect.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Such regular use of magic is not cheap. As a result, the independent captains often break (or at least severely bend) the vow that keeps them out of the pearl beds seven months a year. Ganaís ships and divers are sometimes caught by the sea elves and locathah that migrate into the pearl beds from the west. Such divers work at their own risk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the close of the pearl season, Gana holds a three day celebration known as the Festival of the Pearl. This is the time when accounts are settled between the pearl divers and captains, and a great feast is distributed among the people by the sultan and the mosque officials. The celebration is marked by dancing in the street, skyrockets, and the occasional breaking of the Law (such as public insobriety or lewdness) giving Gana a reputation as a wild city. Once the pearl season is officially over, a number of ships and their crews become available for hire to adventurers and merchants. Still poor, most divers join such crews or migrate to harvest frankincense. A handful will have saved enough money to support themselves until the next pearl season. Very few will have saved enough to afford a small boat and become a captain themselves.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The end of the Festival of the Pearl marks the official beginning of an annual challenge or contest conducted by the sultan: the Great Task of the Pearl. The "task" is to bring some wonder or marvel from abroad to the city and present it to the sultan. Those interested have seven months to complete the task before the inauguration of the new pearl season. During this period, a number of adventurers and other wonderworkers pass through the court, bringing all manner of strange beasts, fantastic treasures, and mighty and unique magics. The chief judge verifies that the items are safe and secured before presentation. Whoever produces the most wonderful item is awarded with great treasures, magics, positions in courts, or favors from the sultan. (For example, one noted pirate gained a full pardon upon delivering the head of a sahuagin queen.) All other items become the property of the sultan, regardless of their value. (That ís the price one pays for participating in the Great Task of the Pearl.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Major Products: Pearls, trade, sea crafts (shells, buried treasure, and the like), aromatic gums, frankincense, myrrh.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Armed Forces: 5,000-man city guard; 2,000-man mercenary infantry; ìofficialî navy of 30 ships, which protect the pearl-diving vessels in the banks; a supplemental rookery of five rocs with riders, which operate out of the mountains east of the city. The court of Gana has been accused of employing privateers and raiders to harass craft from Jumlat, but often such raids are the conducted by individual captains.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Major Mosques: Hajama, Hakiyah, Haku, Pantheon (a moralist faction), and Selan.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rumors and Lore: Like Jumlat, Gana has recently been plagued by the sudden disappearances of divers and boats in the pearl banksóand these events have hampered the cityís trade. Most residents believe that the ìshark monsterî described by divers from Jumlat is no more than a ruse, designed to drive Ganaís ships from the area. The sultan of Gana has offered 50,000 gp and a ship to the adventurer who either destroys  the creature or proves that it does not exist.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Secrets:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">See the entry below on Jumlat for possibilities regarding the mysterious disappearances in the Pearl Beds. At your option, in addition to the creature(s), one or more Jumlati ships may be engaged in wholesale sinking of Gani vessels and killing divers: acts of war for which they blame the creatures.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rumor of Al’ia bint Hazir bearing the sultan’s children are true. She has borne him three sons and a daughter (using illusionary magic to hide her condition in court each time). The children are being raised in a monastery in the Al-Yabki Mountains (Weeping Mountains). All may be identified by a butterfly-shaped mole beneath their right eyes. The children are:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Yusef (hmF/f/8)ó The eldest son is a headstrong individual who sees things in black and white. Mulad (hmW/sh/6) The middle brother is rebellious and continually seeking to show his elder brother that magical ability outweighs physical prowess.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Alayna (hfP/h/5)ó The only daughter is uncomfortable with their eventual fate, once their true heritage is revealed, and wishes to remain in a simple, holy life of aiding others.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Gusard (hmB/r/5)ó The youngest child is the clown, the entertainer, and the lady killer. He can’t wait for the day when their father decides that they can come out of hiding and they can live a little.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two scrolls signed by the sultan tell of the children’s true parentage one is in Al’ia’s hands, the other in the personal library of the Grand Caliph. A third scroll was to be sent to Qudra, but its carrier disappeared in the desert and was never found. Should the secret of the children be revealed, they will be suddenly swept into court life, for good or ill, with their own partisans and courtiers... and potential assassins. The sultan will not take kindly to one who reveals their presence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A PC may locate such a scroll when adventuring in the desert. Another possibility is that one of the children, for his or her own reasons (pride, rebellion, fear, or boredom) flees the monastery, and the sultan needs someone to bring him back, quickly and quietly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finally, the Great Task of the Pearl offers the potential for heroes to explore the Crowded Sea.</p>
