<p class="regtxt5">The empress of the lotus empire chose the weapons master of Maedhard, Hiromara, to produce a weapon gift for grandfather dragon. she will journey to Pavis (rename) for the weapon hardening compound from the great wastes. her journey will be in 6749 and occurs every 7 years. she sits at the feet of grandfather dragon and learns the wisdom she will need for the coming seasons. the weapons are given to heroes who can seek training from the dragon or its servants. the journey starts High Elder Airday in the month of Tamer and lasts 30 days (to High Council Godsday). the empress enters a cave at the base of the mountains and is teleported to the plateau where grandfather dragon is waiting. the dragon usually appears as an old man. she remains until Awaken Godsday, descends and begins her trip home again.(Razak Airday through Mahasan Godsday). empress passes on as himalayan priesthood - as she dies, a successor is born with her memories and a lotus birthmark on her forehead. forcasts will often indicate where she will be found</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Shadrazaya River used to extend to the area where the Hand operates. This area was the capital city of Kharatoum. The river was driven underground and diverted as part of the war between Nyigroth and Tesch Mar. Now Kharatoum is under sand and desolate. Ruins of the cities along the old river are buried and revealed by the storms that roll across the Kharatoum Habaya.</p>
