<p class="regtxt5">The Machine Ruins is the southern-most major port in the <a href="lotus_inx.htm">Lotus Empire</a>. This port is the end point for traders trading into the Free Islands and other islands in the south and east of the Crowded Sea.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The regional Emir, Jazrellya ni Shalahazra, is a lonely and friendly woman. She will politely ask any obvious new-comers to dine with her and desperately wants to swap tales of adventure with them. She is a kind and generous ruler, loved by her city and the Emirate surrounding it. The rise of a rather tough and organized band of reaiders concerns her and she would pay well for the removal of these troubles. So far her troops have been unable to find the lair of the villains.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One of the notable inns of the town is the Broken Tree Inn. It is near the gate to the Trade Road, the overland route to the Cities of the Pearl farther north. Merp, a bard of reknown from the Hell Gate Wars, makes his home here. He has adapted to the lesser role of men in the Empire and enjoys the relative anonymity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A second tavern, the Holed Frieghter, is the most popular establishment in the docks area. There is an entrance to the <a href="../shardra_s/shardra_inx.htm">Cavern of Dark Delights</a> in one of the back rooms. Those desiring access must either be known by the tavern keeper or a friend of an already authorized member.</p>
