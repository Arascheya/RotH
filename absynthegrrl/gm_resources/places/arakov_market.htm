<p class="pagecaption">Arakov Market</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Arakov Markets is a chain of upscale, organic markets supplying various neighborhoods in the Yew Nork city environs. The markets started from a location in The Village, in a building the Arakovs owned. There was a medium store front on the ground floor and the family lived above. As the store became more successful, the Arakovs bought the building next door and expanded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One of the main reasons for success is the Mirror Souk that is accessed from the market. The Arakovs came from <a href="planescape/centrys.htm">Sphere</a> because they wanted a quieter life. Once they arrived, they realized the world they came to had a small underground of planars and other beings hiding in the normalcy of the rest of the populace. These others missed access to the Great Souk. Working with the Free Trade Alliance the Arakovs set up the foundation of the Mirror Souk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a warren of tunnels and rooms radiating out from the Mirror Souk that function as living areas for those from beyond the veil that are visiting. These tunnels are deep and carefully engineered to be extremely hard to find or to flood. The Awakened have people in the planning offices for any underground activities to make sure the warrens are not breached by city projects.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Only those who have been plane-touched can see the entrance to the Mirror Souk.</p>
