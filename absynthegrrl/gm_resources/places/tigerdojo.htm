<p class="regtxt5">The Tiger Dojo is run by Martin Esterhaaz, a retired martial arts compition winner. Martin retired after he was hit by a car. His knees and hips are stiff and painful, but he can still teach. Martin also crafts specialty weapons, mostly for the awakened, and choreographs fights for the High School of the Arts and Jiuliard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tiger Dojo is located in the basement of <a href="..\info\ezra_magic.htm">Ezra's Magic Shop</a>.</p>
