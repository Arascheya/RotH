<p class="pagecaption">The Hood</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This isolated area is a center of poverty and crime. Many call the old factory housing buildings home. Rich landlords from the more affluent parts of the city want to control the properties, so they can develop them into more yuppy-dick housing and chase the undesirables out of town.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The area has more old, large brick buildings than this sample area. Use the street layout and remember buildings can fit any description needed. Think this area with the Batman Narrows kind of look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hood is cut off by the major highways that travel above it and by the somewhat toxic lakes and streams that surround it.
Hwy 90 is the West and North-West Corner boundary of The Hood.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The lake is the East border.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cline Ave. moves south to border what is industrial in this area. It becomes the southern boundary of The Hood.</p>
