<p class="pagecaption">Core Systems</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The systems near the galactic core and most firmly tied into the Imperial governmental structure. In common usage, the systems near the seat of government on Centralys.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Planets</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aristaleez Prime - location of the Alliance Espionage School along with a major university. Aristaleez is a multi-class world where the locals are the laborers and support people for the school and all other off-world interests. Locals are prohibited from direct involvement in many off-world situations.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Centralys - primary seat of government, first for the Alliance, then for the Imperium.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">DesCartes - known for its stunning hardwoods and forest products</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kafritania - in the middle sphere of the Core Systems this planet is mostly a holding of Galacticorp, the banking conglomerate. Large segments of the population live in extended family situations and in near poverty. It is very common for those who can afford it to buy multi-building compounds and turn them into extended family enclaves. Most people work in some way for Galacticorp. Those that don’t fill the ranks of DevelCorp, one of the two major resource development corporations. There are behind the scene ties between the two giants.

<p class="regtxt5">Teyis - on the edge of the Core Systems, this is one of the five main gateway worlds to the Fringe. It has an AG station that is the primary port facility. Only cargo for the planet has to enter the atmosphere. Ships from Core Systems are treated with a great deal of preference. Customs are less strict, credit is easier to qualify for, and accommodations are made. Fringe World ships and crews are encouraged to stay in the older, less plush sections of the station. Independents are even more strongly encouraged to remain out of the better sections.
