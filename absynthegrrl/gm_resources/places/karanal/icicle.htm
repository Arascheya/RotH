<p class="regtxt5">A frozen world where <a href="../../npcs/valen.htm">Valen</a> was stationed shortly after the Seconus Uprisings. Her mission was to locate a woman who had "information damaging to the Alliance". <a href="../../npcs/valen.htm">Valen</a> found her, however, the information wasn't of a type she felt warranted destruction or the disposal of the finder. She dropped out of sight, took up residence with her target, and settled in to a quiet life. Other things intruded.</p>
