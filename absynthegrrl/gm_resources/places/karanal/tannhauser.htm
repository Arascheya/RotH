<p class="regtxt5">reference "Tannhauser Gate" somewhere as part of the <a href="../../valen_inx.htm">Valen Empire</a> - need to decide what and where it is - TG is a dead stargate-like portal on a dead world near the edge of imperial space. it was found near the time of the <a href="../../gods/razaks.htm">Razak</a> Treachery and was written up, but never seriously investigated. it is tied to the <a href="../../info/drkzyrkth.htm">Drkzyrkth</a> and other races of that time. it was one of a few experimental gates created by one of the races as a replacement for hyperdrive technologies - the name of the world is Tannhause 8 in the Iridani Elipsis star cluster - need to place the other 6 gates</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These gates were created by the <a href="../../info/irdisi.htm">Irdisinthyish</a> as part of a proto-type transportation system.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">all in all there are 7 of these at various locations near the dead worlds of that time frame.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the gate itself is a combination of three artificial moons and a massive portal-like structure floating nearby. the gate was activated by a series of timed energy pulses, fired from the moons, into the center of the focusing mechanism which formed the actual gate. once the gate was "open" anything shoved through it would pop out the other end at the target destination. this destination was set into the focus ring before creating the portal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the moons contained the systems for creating and focusing the trigger pulses. these were powered by massive fusion reaction systems. the races involved in this project hadn't developed antimatter technology of any form.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">this was their main reason for trying to move to this gate technology. their fusion powered starships didn't have the range they desired. also, there were serious problems with the fuel scoop approach they were using to refuel when far from their main systems. the gates were working when the Drkzyrkth accident occured, dooming them all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Drkzyrkth bionoids - these came on line shortly before the nano-tech disasters. these are to be a replacement for the <a href="../../monsters/l7_aliens.htm">Gieger/Alien Saga beasties</a> that i have been using for a more publishable item. bionoids come in various flavors and types, from combat units to infiltrators, to command and control systems. all forms are extremely dangerous when cornered. only the infiltrators will not attack on detection of an enemy presence.</p>
