<p class="pagecaption">Karanal Data</p>

<p class="pagecaption">Updated Theory and Application</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Karanal started as alt. earth (<a href="../../../hut_online/madtown003.htm">alt. London</a>). This is the origin point for <a href="../../npcs/angelique.htm">Angelique</a> and the <a href="../../info/mega_ascend.htm">mega-corps</a> that proliferated before the rise of the <a href="../../valen_inx.htm">Alliance</a>. This world became uninhabitable when the parasite race was brought back and released. The world developed close to the way earth actually has until the late 1800s. At this point various forces and events drastically changed the direction and motion. These events resulted in the rise of <a href="../../companies_inx.htm">mega-corps</a> as the driving political force and the weakening and final destruction of nation-states as dominant political systems.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The <a href="../../companies_inx.htm">mega-corps</a> evolved into a Gibsonian style environment, leading to the cybernetic explosion and the slowing of space exploration. It took a second set of drastic circumstances to jump-start the space vector once again. Once started this vector spread rapidly. From it the <a href="../../eritsani_inx.htm">Eritsani</a> formed, hyperdrive technology evolved, and the exploration and diaspora began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The parasites interacted with some of the local life to form the <a href="../../info/trcrystal.htm">Thought Crystal</a> deposits found in the time of <a href="../../npcs/valen.htm">Valen</a>. By the time the Empire was at its peak the homeworld had been dead for over one thousand years. (see <a href="../../info/timeline.htm">timeline</a>)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In this version Karanal does not need to be a dry world. It only needs to have a place where the <a href="../../info/trcrystal.htm">Thought Crystal</a> organisms could go to flourish and some reasonably stable ruins for the archeologists of <a href="../../npcs/valen.htm">Valen</a>'s time to find.</p>

<p class="pagecaption">Older theories and Data</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Karanal was the origination point for the human race. There were massive migrations when an ecological disaster struck. The same disaster led to the formation of various nasties that now roam the planet. Sand kraken have a symbiot that aids in the production of the lubricant/skin hardener that allows them to easily move through the sand. This lubricant also aids in the breaking down of softer rock into sand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Karanal has never been a particularly water rich world, but the eco disaster bound most of what was left in inaccessible biomass. It also released nasty diseases and toxins into the system.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thought crystal was developed in the form of an algae like crystalline organism that broke down monooxitricarenium chaladium and ingested it. As the algae grows it forms itself into clear crystal forms with a hint of purple moving in it. The algae is alive as long as the purple coloration is changing, if it is static, the algae has died. It was found that in the presence of electromagnetic waves these crystals behaved similar to neurons in carbon organic life. The smallest unit capable of this type of action was a seventy molecule size crystal. Ways were quickly developed to use this life form as the storage sections of high end computer systems. The concept of a completely crystalline computer was quickly envisioned and might have become a reality if the Razak uprising hadn't interfered. A side effect was the ability to use these crystals as amplifiers and symbiots with carbon organic life forms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Karanal was surveyed approx ten years before it was designated a government site. Ruins of some type of civilization were found at various locations and a research crew was sent to investigate. They were attacked by the sand kraken when they were in the deeper desert. There were other difficult life forms that harried them when they were in the rocky areas. After a couple of years and several casualties, not to mention loss of equipment, they departed. When the alliance needed a secure weapons research facility they quietly slipped it onto Karanal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Valen rose to power she instituted a massive build-up. Most of the major Karanal developments came after this build-up. Work was contracted through World Morphers Inc. this corporation exists as a front for covert government projects. Workers are hired on an as needed basis from various different worlds. They are transported to undisclosed destinations, perform the work, then are returned to the departure point. This does allow for a possible infiltration path. The talons have used this on several occasions to get information to and from Elentaryn.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The main facility is underground, in a retro-fitted section of one of the early civilization’s cities. it was the first section built up and the first project that involved World Morphers. Until Valen, they were rarely used, existing more as an optional device than a reality. They have grown fat and during Valen’s time. They will oppose her son because he plans to shut them down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The archeological team found just enough information before they fled to realize there could be a lot of interesting things to be found. Mostly they were bought off by the alliance and later the imperium. A couple of them disappeared into the fringe systems and have told a few others about it. There is a small group trying to get together ships and crew to return and continue exploring.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Karanal opening sequence: go to the arrow in the center of the staging platform, then walk in the direction of the arrow and to the right to reach the right forward corner, turn and go to the corner to your left, return to the center and keep walking the diagonal until you reach the next corner, turn and go to the remaining corner, then return to the arrow. A panel will open, insert the key ring and enter 10362501 on the key pad. This will open the personnel hatch and allow entry.</p>
