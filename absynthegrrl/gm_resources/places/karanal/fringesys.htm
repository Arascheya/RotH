<p class="pagecaption">Fringe Systems</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Those systems near the edge of the Alliance/Imperium that form the border areas. Most common usage though is for those planets at the fringe of the galactic main sections, the void between the arms, and the edge of Alliance/Imperial space.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fertearns World</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="icicle.htm">Icicle</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="karanaldata.htm">Karanal</a> - considered either a Fringe World or a Beyond World (beyond the fringe worlds), it is a military research and development facility. Few know of its existence and fewer know what occurs there. For a time it was funded internally by the military command. <a href="../../npcs/valen.htm">Valen</a> took direct charge of funding when she took over.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marwatt’s Reach - at farthest edge of Fringe Systems, it is the third point of a triangle formed by Terristra, It was originally the home world of the Vymr race. About 15 years ago the OutSystems Corp acquired it and began their usual rape and profit program acquiring a planet, stripping them of all valuable resources, then planet forming them, using government funding and specifications, then release them as colony worlds. Officially they are not supposed to interfere with indigent populations if it turns out there are any. Unofficially, as long as no one complains, xenocide is ignored.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Milos Hope - even further on the Fringe than Marwatt’s Reach, this is where the most of the Semyods and Vymr immigrated to when the Company took over Marwatt’s. So far they are safe, but the Company has sent several survey teams to Milos Hope to prospect for Company desired materials.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Seconus Dyad</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Terristra System - one of the Fringe Worlds close to the Core Systems gateway worlds. This world sees quite a bit of Core - Fringe trade. It has an older AG station to handle the volume of trade. Only planet bound cargo gets routed down to the surface.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Telleris</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tyranthilia - hot house world and station complex, known for Tyranthilus Void Plants. These plants were developed and engineered by Tyranthillium botanists to flourish in low/no gravity climates. They were being developed as an alternative to mechanical air scrubber units for space stations. Several wealthy patrons popularized their application as decorative plants in their ship yachts. Soon the botanists were producing the commercial strains for use in scrubbers and a new line of various varieties for decoration.</p>
