<p class="pagecaption">Far Star Bar</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Far Star is a hole in the wall place located down near the independent section of the docks. It caters to the independent starship crews and station support personnel. It is not a high class place at all sso if you are looking for a nice quiet place to relax with a drink, this is not it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It is run by a fire tempered redhead named Lise. She serves four grades of beer, several varieties of hard stuff, and a few good hard liquors that she personally likes. There are no mixers and no fancy drinks at this place. The music tend to be loud and danceable, selected from a battered music station in the corner.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rules for employees:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Don’t date the customers</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Don’t bring your dates in - must appear available at all times but never be available.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Keep it within legal - can be to the bleeding edge, but never over the line.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lise - owner and best of Lynn’s friends, quick to laugh, quick to anger, volatile but like a quick storm rather than a smoldering fire - red head, a little older and worn looking</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Marta - cocky, sarcastic one - direct and forward - youngest of the bunch, from a bad home, darker skin, black hair, think Faith for personality.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tom - token guy - bi and wild - red hair, blue eyes, thinish but well formed</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erisa - tease and flirt - presents a shy and innocent kind of air - blonde, all wide eyed and innocent overlaying the world savvy woman underneath</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Marla - quiet and calm - bouncer - medium size and build but knows enough martial arts to take care of all but the nastiest troublemaker. think Marla from Fight Club.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Menu - several kinds of beer - lite, ok, medium, and good; Hard stuff - no mixed drinks, no watered drinks - only stuff easy to dispense with good rate of return.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Any good stuff is Lise’ personal likes</p>
