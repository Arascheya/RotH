someone an idiot, as in, "Did you hear what that addle-coved wizard wanted us to do?"</p>

someone a blood is a mark of high respect.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">BOB. The business of cheating someone, whether it’s of their cash, honor, or trust. A good guide to Centrys will warn a cutter when someone’s bobbing him. Thieves boast that they "bobbed some leatherhead on the street."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">CUTTER. A term that refers to anybody, male or female, that a person wants. It does suggest a certain amount of resourcefulness or daring, and so
it’s a lot better than calling somebody a berk.</p>
