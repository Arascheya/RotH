<p class="pagecaption">The Sphere - Centrys</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Sphere, Sphere, Centrys, City at the Center, City of Portals, Gateway to Everywhere, these are the terms often applied to this city of power. It is the heart of the known mulit-verse. From here there are portals to any plain, realm, or state of existence in the multi-verse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Centrys forms a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere">Dyson Sphere</a> around an energy nexus point located at the center of creation. This is the point where the <a href="../../gods/creator.htm">Creator</a> was imprisoned by the <a href="../../info/3sisters.htm">Three Sisters</a>. She... has set the containment to wax and wain in terms of energy output to provide a night and day cycle of twenty hours to The Sphere. It is the leakage of creative force that makes The Sphere the place of such possibility.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sections will come into being as groups create settlements on the edges of the undefined areas and push the edges in.. Various sections of the city exist on the inner surface of the sphere. Anywhere that is not defined appears as shifting fog and shadow. She Who Must Not Be Named will dissolve various sections of the city if activities prove too dangerous. This leaves the city in a state of constant change with things coming into being, being built over, and fading away. As a result Sphere is filled with conflicting architectures, myriads of twisting little ways and alleys, and a wealth of strange shops in odd little angles. Only the professional guides have a clue to the what of the city, and even they get lost sometimes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The outside of the sphere is the "sun" seen from the <a href="plains.htm">Sphere of Concordant Discord</a>. This sphere is another dysan sphere surrounding the Centrys sphere. The inner surface contains pocket domains of various beings and factions. The outside of the sphere attaches to various planes of hell, elemental plains, real space realms, and whatever else has been attached or grown from it over the millennia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Centrys is based loosely on Sigil from Planescape in terms of layout, wards, and places. Centrys is a brighter, more beautiful place in some ways, however. There is some greenery in Centrys, enough to keep the air sort of clean, even with the myriad of fires burning to provide light and heat. Centrys is a bit chill, average temperatures in the 50's.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Centrys is a city of contrasts. On the surface it appears clean and bright, but like everything else, this is only the outer face. Centrys is a city of complicated politics, strained relationships, and rolling change. New buildings sprout from old, streets get covered over to become dark alleys, pits are dug into the fabric of the sphere, and everywhere things are in constant flux.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../npcs/she.htm">She Who Must Never Be Named</a>, the <a href="../../npcs/she.htm">Lady of Centrys</a>, is a shadow figure, lurking in the background, keeping the city safe and functioning. No one knows what the <a href="../../npcs/she.htm">Lady</a> looks like. None who have beheld her have lived to tell the tale. Any who oppose her are either found turned inside out or locked in mini-planar mazes from which escape is well-nigh impossible. It is said she wanders the streets of Centrys, keeping an eye on her domain from the shadows. She has no palace, no throne room, no visible sign of power, yet any threat to the existence of Centrys and Her wrath is swift and final.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Centrys retains the <a href="sigil_wards/sigil_maps.htm">five wards</a>, Mistress, Lower, Clerk, Guildhall and Market, and Hive. These form wedge-like slices, similar to the segments of an orange, across the surface of the sphere. The Sphere is much more varied in composition, with rain storms, sunny days, smoggy times, and other random patterns of air effects. Being a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere">Dyson Sphere</a>, it is its own weird ecosystem.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The upper and lower "points" where the wards come closest togehter (the "points" of the orange segements") are called the "Convergences". The Convergence at the point to your right if facing from the Lower Ward to the Mistress Ward is called the "Upper Convergence", making the one to the left the "Lower Convergence". Many shady places will gravitate to the Convergences to make them easily accessible from all the wards.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Mistress Ward</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Houses of the nobility and the well to do are in this section of the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Lower Ward</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Doorways and Portals belch smoke, fire, and foul smells when opened, tainting the air of this section. Many of the Doors and Portals open to the lower planes and domains in this section.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Clerk's Ward</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Houses the bureaucracy of Centrys. Many traders, clerks, merchants, and other mid-level influence types reside in this ward.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Guildhall and Market Ward</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Houses the trade alliances, businesses, shops and commercial exploits of Centrys. The <a href="../../info/freetrade.htm">Free Trade Alliance</a>, a multi-versal trading firm, has its primary offices and facilities in this ward.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Also houses the <a href="sphere_souk.htm">Great Souk</a>, the great, sprawling market where planars from all walks come to search for the rare, the common, and the sublime. If it can't be found here, it probably can't be had for mere money.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Hive Ward</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Houses the scum and villainy, well the most obvious and odious forms of it anyway. Scum and Villainy can be found anywhere in Centrys if one is not careful.</p>
