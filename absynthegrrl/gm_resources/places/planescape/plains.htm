<p class="pagecaption">The Discord - Sphere of Concordant Discord</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere">Dyson Sphere</a> surrounding <a href="centrys.htm">Centrys</a> where the various Outer Planes touch. It is a wild zone where small to large strongholds or regions are held by various powers of the plains. Scattered through it are doors to <a href="centrys.htm">Centrys</a>. This is one of the ways to get to <a href="centrys.htm">Centrys</a>, come to the Discord and find a doorway. The <a href="centrys.htm">Centrys</a> sphere is the "sun" for this region, brightening and darkening to the same cycle as the central nexus point that provides light and heat to <a href="centrys.htm">Centrys</a>. Similar to <a href="cwntrys.htm">Centrys</a>, any non-claimed section of the Discord will appear as shifting fog and shadow. Once it is claimed, it will morph into a domain based on the intent of the being claiming it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* rework this so all items match the concept of two dysan sphers */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Concordant Opposition, or Opposition, is the outer surface of the Concordant Discord. This surface is the contact point between the center and the rest of the multi-verse. There are numerous tunnels from the outside to the inside allowing travel into the Discord and from there, the possibility of entry into Centrys.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">From Planescape Modules</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These are extracted bits - see the PS_SigilAndBeyond pdf for the full dark of it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Outlands are what the Clueless refer to as the Plane of Concordant Opposition - a mouthful, to say the least. Whatever a sod calls it, it isn’t the wildest, weirdest, or most hostile plane in the multiverse, which is preciselv the reason it makes a good campaign base.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Clueless figure that, being a plane of perfect neutrality, the Outlands have got to be the most boring place around. It’s obvious they haven’t spent time there, and they certainly haven’t had to cool their heels in the Astral for too long - now that’s boring! Sure, the Outlands don’t have the burning pits of Baator, the howling madness of Pandemonium, or even the glowing mountain of Celestia. The Land’s a little short on big, spectacular landscapes, but it ain’t boring, berk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It’s because the plane’s neutral that the place is so popular. Anyone with the means can come here - that’s one of the properties of the plane. On most of the Great Ring, a power can’t enter a plane that’s not its home, but on the Outlands any power can come and go as it wants. That doesn’t mean it can do anything it wants, though. Visiting powers respect the realms of those deities native to the Outlands, and they usually can’t enter them without permission. Even petitioners from other planes can come here, though most of them are from the Upper Planes (the guards of the Lower Planes don’t like their prizes getting loose).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sigil stands at the very heart of the plane, balanced on a spire that disappears into nothingness above. This is important: There’s no way to walk from the Outlands, or anywhere else for that matter, into Sigil. The Cage can be reached ONLY through the many doors that open onto its streets.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The realms of the Outlands lie mostly along the outer edges of the plane, close to portals that lead to the Great Ring. There are 13 known realms and there’s rumors of more, though no blood’s ever found them. Most of these realms are the domains of single powers, but a few are home to several related powers. Each realm adopts the character of its ruling power or powers. The most significant or best-known ones are described below. See the map of the Outlands to pinpoint their positions.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">TIR NA QG</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Land of Youth is the largest of the realms in the Land, and home to most powers of the Celtic pantheon: Daghdha, Diancecht, Goibhniu, Lugh, Manannan rnac Lir, Morrigan, and Oghma. The realm is divided into lesser areas, where particular powers are dominant. For instance, Mag mell (Field of Happiness) is the domain of Daghdha. Here the woods are lush and well tended, intermixed with fields of oats, wheat, and barley. Orchards of apples and sloes seem to grow with haphazard neatness. There are no cities in Tir na Og, only villages and lone homesteads. The petitioners there live in rural contentment, supporting themselves mainly through hunting, farming, and weaving.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In another part of the realm are the workshops of Goibhniu, built at the bases of exposed hills. Far distant is Tir fo Thuinn, the Land Under the Waves. This is the domain of Manannan mac Lir. On the surface there is nothing, but below the waves is an entire kingdom peopled by petitioners who farm, herd, and labor as if they were on the surface.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">THE NORNS</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This realm can be reached only by crossing a wilderness more savage than most. It’s a tiny realm, but one that possesses great power. Here the Norns of Norse lore huddle among the roots of the planespanning Yggdrasil. The canopy is so thick that the realm’s like a great cavern. The few petitioners here are unhappy shades waiting to hear from the Norns. These powers huddle round the Well of Urd to read the fates of men and gods. Sometimes a prime or a planar’ll consult them, but it’s bad business to learn one’s future before it’s time.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">SHEELA PERYROYL'S REALM</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This area is small; indeed, everything about it is undersized, as befits a power of the halflings. There are no cities or towns here, only a single, extensive orchard and a large halfling farm, partially above ground, but mostly below. The petitioners here are all halflings, tending the great orchard and farm.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">THE DWARVEN MOUNTAIN</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So named for the breed of its petitioners and its powers, this realm lies under the influence of Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, and Vergadain. The whole realm takes the form of a gigantic rocky mountain. The powers take no interest in the mountain’s surface, so there are random petitioner and planar settlements on its slope that have little to do with the realm. Inside, the mountain is honeycombed with caverns. Those nearest the peak are the domain of
Vergadain, which is notorious for its gaming halls and rumored treasure houses, as befits a god of luck and wealth. Further down is the domain of Dugmaren. There, the caverns are a wild disarray of furnaces, forges, smelters, villages, and libraries filled with esoteric tomes on metallurgy and other iron crafts. The deepest part of the realm is claimed by Dumathoin. This area is nothing but cold caverns and mines coiling around great veins of ore. It is mmored that the petitioners of this domain spend their days and nights secretly singing the chants that cause the veins to swell and grow. Very little is actually smelted, for the petitioners here prize metal only in its natural state.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The petitioners here are all dwarves, if a sod couldn’t guess, although there’s more than a few run-ins with folks from the realms of Gzemnid Ilsensine, and others on the surface. See page 36 for more information on the Dwarven Mountain.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">SEMUANYA’S BOG</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The far shore of Tir fo Thuinn barely rises above the plane’s equivalent of sea level, becoming a nest for lizard men and other bog lovers. The petitioners found here are truly unique: lizard men, all. It’s a mostly deserted realm, although some independent minded planars, including more than one desperate outlaw, have set their kip here.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">GZEMNID AND ILSENSINE’S REALM(s)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">No blood knows if these two powers share one realm or if they just lack the imagination to make their realms different. Both rule over caverns that run deeper than even the dwarf realm, and all the tunnels merge together. Things foul and dangerous are supposed to stalk the halls, and most bashers figure
there’s secret portals to the Lower Planes here. Certainly, the darker fiends of the Lower Planes take residence in these realms when business brings them to the Outlands.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gzemnid’s realm is a dangerous and deadly maze. Illusions, distortions, and subtle charms predominate here to match the beholder god’s nature. There’s no settlements - a petitioner’s got to go it on his own, setting up his own nest somewhere in the passages. The petitioners themselves are an unpleasant lot: a few beholders and a goodly number of thieves. They’re willing to make deals, but they’re always on the watch for their own rewards.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ilsensine’s realm is the more dangerous of the two. The illithid god exists here only because it conspires against Good, Evil, Law, and Chaos alike. Planar adventurers don’t like to go here because the place pulses with a mind-wracking drone that burns in a basher’s head. Nor are they welcome, since the ruling power prefers those whom it can control. Still, it’s said that here a cutter can learn nearly anything that transpires on another plane - if he can stay sane long enough to find Ilsensine and ask the question. It’s quite possible that Ilsensine maintains realms on other planes, or that it’s a god-brain whose neurons flow to the other planes, much like the roots of Yggdrasil. See "The Caverns of Thought", on page 32, for more information about Ilsensine’s realm.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">THE CAVERNS OF THOUGHT</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Character</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Too much energy, too much thought, the constant burn of brain-waves sizzles in the mind's ear. No secrets stay dark; no thoughts, no sickness that every berk won't know. The cursed illithid god's realm'll rip it all right out of a cutter, and if she's real lucky she'll leave with an intact mind. But only if she's real lucky.</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Power</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ilsensine(MM), god of the mind flayers, is the sole master of this realm. The great green brain that is llsensine rests at the very heart of the realm, with its tentacular nerves running through the earth, along cavern walls, and even into distant planes. There's no dark in this realm that Ilsensine doesn't know, no movement its nerves don't sense. It's Ilsensine's loathsome thought waves that batter a cutter's brain while she's wandering through the tunnels. It's Ilsensine who learns a berk's every secret and stores them away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Principle Towns</p>

<p class="regtxt9">There's no towns here because Ilsensine's petitioners don't have minds anymore, and those leatherheaded planars who wander here don't keep theirs long enough to build more than a wall. Out on the edge of the realm there’s bits of walls and sometimes a little bed - the only remains of some poor sod’s attempt to make a home here (probably a petitioner from the Dwarven Mountain, trying to spread its glory a little further). Whoever the little sod is that built it, he might turn up sooner or later, wandering the tunnels with his brain burnt out.</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">THE PALACE OF JUDGEMENT</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This realm is a single massive palace, along with its appropriate bureaucracies, granaries, stables, and side-palaces. The entire realm is enclosed in a wall of red brick, patrolled by vigilant petitioners. This is the realm of Yen-Wang-Yeh, judge of the Ten Law Courts and king of the Eighteen Hells. Here, all those petitioners under the sway of the Celestial Bureaucracy are received, judged, and consigned to their appropriate planes and realms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Palace of Judgment’s a unique case. There’s conduits there to every realm of the Celestial Bureaucracy (the pantheon of high-ups who call themselves Chinese): Acheron, Gehenna, Mechanus, Mount Celestia, and the Prime Material Plane are just a few. These pipes are used to shoot petitioners along to their justly deserved places (so figure the ones to the Lower Planes get used a bit more than those to the Upper Planes). Therefore, the petitioners there aren’t only petitioners of the Outlands. If any newly dead sod falls under the Celestial Bureaucracy’s purview, then he’s got to come here first, so there’s petitioners destined for every plane walking around the Palace. Those that’re judged and assigned to be kept on the Outlands usually wind up as clerks and petty bureaucrats for the whole operation. The Palace is big, too. The chant is there’s 9,001 rooms behind its walls. Probably the only being who knows for sure is Yen-Wang-Yeh himself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">See page 42 for more information on the Palace of Judgment.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">HANN THE BUILDER’S LABORATORY - credit Sally for this one</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This realm borders the Dwarven Mountain. A cutter might even mistake it for part of Dugmaren Brightmantle’s domain. It looks like an endless workshop filled with columns, pipes, catwalks, brightly polished devices of all types, and near-endless book stacks that disappear into darkness. Libraries are jammed next to armories, forges next to kitchens. It’s the realm of Hann the Builder, god of artifice and science. Here, the petitioners spend their days inventing and building. Most are human, but there’s a good number of gnomes hard at work, too. It’s the place to go for the best gear a cutter could need, although some say the magic’s better in Tir na Og or the Dwarven Mountain.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">THOTH’S ESTATE</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thoth’s realm is a big one. It’s a collection of several villages and towns that dot the banks of the Ma’at, that rises out of Semuanya’s Bog and flows through Thoth’s realm. A basher’s got to watch out for crocodiles and crocodile-like creatures here. At the center of the realm is Thebestys, the great city of Thoth, and at its center is the Great Library. A cutter is supposed to be able to find the answer to anything here, if he can just find the right scroll. The petitioners are a normal lot, living ordinary lives along the river.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">THE HIDDEN REALM - this is Realms of the Hut based data</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It’s a laugh to say this realm’s well known, since no sod can ever seem to find it. Most bloods figure it’s really a demiplane somehow attached to the Outlands. By report, it’s the home of the Fleshfeaster, a demi-god of canibals and other flesh eating beings. Stories say the realm itself is a beautiful reach of forests and streams, a veritable paradise for the senses, except for the perpetual smell of roasting pork. Towering ruins poke up from the steep hillsides and above the trees. Deep glens hold tumbling streams, and sunlit glades dot the valley bottoms. The dark of it is, this is <a href="../../../hut_online/navsys.htm">Home 0</a> for the <a href="../../../hut_online/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a> of All Worlds. It truly is a paradise and now that Margla is released the smell of roasting flesh has faded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In a large clearing, in a deep glen, is the "winter" quarters for the <a href="../../info/carnival.htm">Dark Carnival</a>. This is where the <a href="../../info/carnival.htm">Dark Carnival</a> will come when it takes a break from traveling the multivers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">THE MAUSOLEUM OF CHRONEPSIS</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This realm is a compact one, as it’s got no petitioners and only one inhabitant - Chronepsis, the dragon god of fate. His realm is a great cavern in the mountains near the Dwarven Mountain. Here he rests, surrounded by hourglasses that slowly dribble out the sands of life for every dragon and dragon-kin of the multiverse.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">THE COURT OF LIGHT</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is the realm of Shekinester, the naga goddess. It’s relatively close to the Palace of Judgment. Her petitioners are nagas of all types,
although the worst and best wind up on other planes. Only a featherhead comes here, as old Shekinester’s an unpredictable power. A cutter never knows just what aspect her realm’s going to reflect - Weaver, Empowerer, or Preserver. It’s also risky going to her realm because her petitioners just might decide a berk’s got to be "initiated" into some mystery, and that can be an unpleasant Drocess. On the other hand, there’s a lure to these mysteries, because a few of the berks that return from here have insights denied to other bloods. See page 34 for more information.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There’s more realms than just these on the Outlands, but most of them are so small that they hardly count, or they’re so bizarre that a body can’t make any sense of them. This ain’t to say that the entire land is filled with realms; there’s also empty spaces between the lands. ’Course, "empty"’s not the right description. These boundaries are filled with the towns and cities of planars, and there’s quite a few cursed petitioners who don’t have a power to call their lord. The empty lands are mostly dry plains, not lush but not desert - a balance between too little and too much. One blood said it reminded her of a place called the Great Plains on some prime-material world.</p>
