<p class="pagecaption">The Asylum</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Asylum is found on the Street of Silks in the <a href="sphere_souk.htm">Great Souk</a>, the Grand Bazaar of <a href="centrys.htm">Sphere</a>. It is a haven for those that have just arrived, a place of haven for those unable to adjust, and a house of pleasure. It is the largest building in the Great Souk and houses those unable to fend for themselves, those that tend them, various caretakers and staff, and the <a href="../../info/flowers_sphere.htm">Flowers</a>, the pleasure givers, known throughout  <a href="centrys.htm">Sphere</a>. The brothel part of the Asylum caters to all manner of beings, from the boring to the strange. The only rule is the staff must not be killed or seriously damaged. Beyond that, it is between the staff and client what is permissible. The bouncers are capable of taking down any threat to the staff and do not hesitate if called upon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Asylum was founded by <a href="../../npcs/iskandera.htm">Arascheya Iskandera</a> and her lovers, Mary and Steve. Descendents of the founders remain involved with The Asylum in current times.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../npcs/irishkah.htm">Irishkah</a> is the current madame of the Asylum.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The courtyard depicted in the <a href="sphere_souk.htm">Souk</a> map is the central area of the Asylum. It is a quiet place of fountains and comfortable furniture where patrons may relax, eat, drink, and select from the various Flowers for later pleasure. The building extends above the <a href="sphere_souk.htm">Souk</a> in many floors and it also extends deep into the foundation structure of <a href="centrys.htm">Sphere</a> as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is another narrow, dirty, courtyard that contains the entrance to the <a href="12factols.htm">Neutral Zone</a> and the shelter portion of the Asylum. The shelter, known as The Refuge, is a place where children can drop in, stay for a while, or just get off the streets for a time. Adults are expected to petition the main sections of The Asylum for sanctuary. The Refuge is set up as a safe place for those not of age.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Asylum is viewed with distrust by many of the powerful factions in <a href="centrys.htm">Sphere</a>. The Asylum is its own political entity, with powerful friends scattered through the city. The Asylum has a seat with the other great factions in the ruling council of <a href="centrys.htm">Sphere</a>. Many of the more lawful and puckered factions would love to tear down the Asylum and crush its influence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Asylum has a group of covert operatives, formally called the Daughters of Arascheya, that are used to enforce Asylum safety and policy. What few know is these operatives are also used to secure newly formed Gates throughout the multi-verse. This is to prevent dangerous levels of incursion into Realms that would not be able to withstand them. There is a detection mechanism on the underside of Sphere where Asylum Detectors monitor the multi-verse for Gate formation. The Detectors float in a pool of fluid, similar to the pre-cogs in Minority Report, that is placed between a World Gate and a Web Gate. The energy tension between the two resonates in a continuous pattern. The eruption of a new set of Gates disturbs this resonance and the Detectors sense it. They give the location data to the operatives assigned to Gate duty.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Daughters of Arascheya are not all lineal descendents of Arascheya. There is no distinction within the order for genetic descendents over recruits. Not all genetic descendents join the order either. The order considers discretion and secrecy two of the top priorities. Members will be removed from the order for breaking silence, harming another member through action, inaction, or information release, or endangering the Asylum needs and desires. The order is under the direct command of the current madame, so their strength or weakness is related to the strengths and weaknesses of the madame. Irishkah is a powerful and charismatic true descendent of Arascheya, returning the order to a strength and effectiveness not seen for generations.</p>
