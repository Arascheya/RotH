<p class="pagecaption">Great Souk - the Grand Bazaar of <a href="centrys.htm">Sphere</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is a great covered market, sprawling through a warren of streets and buildings. Anything can be bought or sold here, if you can only find the right street, shop, or vendor. The Great Souk never closes, although idividual merchants have their own hours.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a> can be found in the Great Souk, along the Street of Silks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are many inns and similar establishments that ring the Great Souk, providing food, entertainments, and lodging for visitors and merchants of the Souk. There are several well-known Doors near the Souk, allowing easy access from multi-planar aware areas outside of Sphere, including several to commonly known sections of <a href="plains.htm">The Discord</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Great Souk is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Bazaar,_Istanbul">Grand Bazaar</a> in Istanbul. For interior design ideas, check these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazaar">bazaars</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Small "mirrors" of the Great Souk exist on various worlds near gates that have a more direct connection to <a href="centrys.htm">Sphere</a>. There is always a <a href="../../info/freetrade.htm">Free Trade Alliance</a> shop in a Mirror Souk, otherwise, the rest of the shops are based on the flavor of the world they are on.</p>
