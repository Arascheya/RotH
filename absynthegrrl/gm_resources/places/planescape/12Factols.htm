<p class="pagecaption">Neutral Zone (The Zone) and the Catacombs</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Persistent rumors claim that the door into the realm of the maintainers exists somewhere within the catacombs, what the dwarves from <a href="plains.htm">The Discord</a> call the Doorway into the Mountain. The rumor is a popular topic of conversation at the The Zone, a restaurant and tavern underneath the city streets, near <a href="asylumflowers.htm">The Asylum</a>. The entrance leads down 99 steps from a dirty, narrow courtyard into an arched and vaulted chamber called Storm Hall, after the loud and blustery singing, yelling, and boasting of the einherier, bariaur, and other Ysgardians who often drink and wrestle there. A few stairs lead up from there to the kitchen, but most patrons go deeper into the catacombs. The very deepest and largest of the The Zone’s chambers is the echoing field of benches called the Deep Hall.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Beyond the Deep Hall is the Hall of the Dead Gods. It is said <a href="../../npcs/she.htm">She...</a> slew the last godling at the dawn of time and claimed <a href="centrys.htm">Sphere</a> as her own. From that point forward all gods have been banned from <a href="centrys.htm">Sphere</a>. Many storerooms lead out of the Deep Hall and the Hall of the Dead Gods, and other passages are said to lie beyond the warded doorways of the storerooms. Once in a while, a mob of drunken revelers will insist on seizing torches and going exploring. When the argument is made at knife point, the barkeeps and serving wenches always agree it is a good idea. Most of these groups are eventually rescued when their torches burn out and they begin screaming in panic, but a few are said to have vanished without a trace into the deep passageways.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Zone, or Neutral Zone, is rowdy, loud, and raucous, however, actual fighting is prohibited. The clientel is a cross section of anything that can be found within <a href="centrys.htm">Sphere</a>, from absolute Lawfull Good to Chaotic Evil, as long as there is no violence, all are welcome. The serving staff has special items which will immediately eject the unruly to random parts of <a href="centrys.htm">Sphere</a>. The layout is multi-layer and down from a ratty courtyard. In the Deep Hall are the arched alcoves, one of which contains a door to the Hut in the time of Irena, or to what becomes Home 0 in the times before. <a href="../../npcs/she.htm">She...</a> often wanders here as a street urchin of indeterminant age and gender - although young enough to be between 11 and 17 depending on the gender the viewer believes.</p>
