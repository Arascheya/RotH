<p class="pagecaption">Eternia - Overview</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Eternia exists as a mandel-bulb kind of 3-D space. It contains various areas where the art and constructs of various races throughout the multiverse are rescued, stored, and distributed from. Most sections of Eternia do not know there are other sections. This minimizes contact between disparate groups and races that might otherwise never know of each other.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The common, central link is the <a href="repository.htm">Great Repositry</a>. There are rail spurs that can connect sections, at the whim of the Keeper, but they aren't guaranteed or easy to find.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Death City train system is the one element that holds across all versions of Eternia. All items and personel travel using this system. The head controllers in dispatch are able to redirect trains with personel not of their version to the correct version in emergency cases. They are sworn to secrecy by the Keeper and will not discuss this with anyone else.</p>
