<p class="pagecaption">Absynthe Palace</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is a public house on the second floor of an older building near the river. <a href="../../npcs/erick.htm">Erick</a> runs it. It is small, seating about thirty at the max. There are two window alcoves overlooking the river. These are the prime places in the house. Tables in the main area vary in size between seating two and six. The tables in the window alcoves are designed for two only. Each table has a yellowed lace covering, silver candle holder, and ornate Victorian chairs designed with maximum comfort in mind. The room is lit with candle light and is kept dark, warm, and inviting. The walls are age blackened paneling with old portraits scattered about. The feeling is the cross between an old drawing room and a fancy club.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../npcs/merris.htm">Merris</a> comes here each year on her birthday. <a href="../../npcs/kali.htm">Kali</a> will come more often after she is introduced to the place. Probably once a month on average.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick took over for the previous owner when he decided to retire from the running of it. The previous owner still lives upstairs.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is one place you have to know about to find. The door from the street is marked only with a small green fairy in the center mullion of the door window. Once you are through the door the world changes. Inside the stairwell is faded opulence in muted reds and oranges.</p>
