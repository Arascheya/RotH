<p class="pagecaption">Goth City</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Goth City is the temporary identifier for the large gothic city between Death City and Portal Station. This city houses <a href="dans.htm">Dans Macabre</a>, <a href="emetals.htm">Eternal Metal Works</a> and various other locations. Goth City is a large tangle of tall buildings, winding streets, and dark, dim areas. Think something like a cross between New York City and Gotham City. The architectural styles surge and collide against one another in random patterns. There is a large park in the center of the city. It is surrounded by towering buildings and narrow streets.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Travel is by underground rail, walking, bicycles, and rail feeds from the rest of Eternia.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is a cathedral, <a href="citycath.htm">City Cathedral</a>, near the park. It is dwarfed by the buildings around it. <a href="../../npcs/rainy.htm">Rainy</a>'s apartment has a spectacular view of the cathedral.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Eternal Metal Works sits outside the city central core, in an industrialized area nearby. <a href="../../npcs/ron_o.htm">Ron</a> commutes to work by bicycle from his home in the fringes of the city. Rainy commutes from her downtown apartment by the underground.</p>
