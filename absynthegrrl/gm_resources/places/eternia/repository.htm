<p class="pagecaption">Great Repository</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Great Repository holds all the information and knowledge ever gathered by the dinizens of Eternia. It is located at the center of Eternia, burried deep in the fabric of the pocket dimension where Eternia is. It is accessible from all sections, times, and areas of Eternia, but only by those attuned to it. Otherwise the tracks, roads, cannals, etc. just end before reaching it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Information is stored in great cathedrals of thought resonant crystal and is accessed by various devices that allow linking to these giant repositories. Unlike Eternia itself, the repository does not store physical items, just data, mostly in image form. When text data is gathered, the <a href="../../monsters/gatherers.htm">Gatherers</a> store it as the images it creates in the mind of the perciever, rather than as direct text. There are translation errors in this, both during the sampling stage and at the viewing stage. Although the viewing stage is more error prone. without the context of the original culture, it is hard to correctly determine what nuance meanings were attached to the images. It takes years of study and emersion for a researcher to get the most benefit from the repository. To that end, there are many researchers on staff from many different species. Some of these researchers are the last members of their race, preserved in the repository with the data they are researching.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The <a href="../../monsters/keepers.htm">Keepers</a> are drider-like beings, recruited from the realms of Ishra. After all - knowledge is the root of all evil according to many religions. The <a href="../../monsters/gatherers.htm">Gatherers</a> are spider-like beings, that began as lesser demons, that the <a href="../../gods/younger_gods.htm">Balance Keeper</a> selected to work for the Repository.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../npcs/klktzash.htm">Klktzash</a> became one of these researchers after she left the <a href="../../../hut_online/marglaperim.htm">Hut</a>. For a brief time she resided at Centrys, but her love of knowledge and her connections through <a href="../../npcs/irena_k.htm">Irena</a> gave her access to the repository and a place she considers nervana.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Access to the Repository is down a large well with a stairway winding around it. Above there are canals and railroads that lead to the various times of Eternia. The Death City depot is a glass and steel victorian structure. Other races and times have different structures for their conveyances to dock at.</p>
