<p class="regtxt5">Just past the cathedral, on the inland side of the street, she saw a dark, brooding building crouching at the point of a triangular block. Her gaze was drawn by the heavy stonework and intricate carvings on its face.  A small sward of overgrown grass lay between the street and the doors with a cracked walkway cutting through it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Curiosity pulled her up the broken and twisted walk to the yellow tape spider-webbed across the carved wooden doors. She could still make out the faded black letters of, "Crime Scene - Do Not Cross". Large brass lion handles glowered at her from behind the tape and stone gargoyles stared down from the roof above.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Quiet waiting oozed from the building both pulling and repelling her. She slowly reached through the tape and pulled the left door open. The rusty hinges squealed in protest as she dragged the door open. Hesitantly she entered, almost as if the building had to reach out and drag her in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dusty colored light fell from a stained glass window high overhead illuminating a circle of orange cones with more yellow tape. Other pools fell on the wide stone stairwell circling its way around the open circular atrium. The hand of the building pulled her more strongly now. She walked to the steps and began climbing. By the time she reached the top she was almost running. She skidded into the fourth floor hallway and stopped confused.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Higher, she had to get higher. Searching she finally found the small oak door with a rose covered ankh carved into it. It opened to a narrow circular wrought iron stairway that drew her higher. Scrambling, almost falling in her haste she clawed her way up and into an ante-room. To her left was a circular room almost completely covered in windows. In front of her was an open space and then another wrought iron circular staircase rising to a higher floor. To her right was a hall leading off in two directions and a door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The view of the cathedral drew her into the circular room. Brightly colored throw pillows covered most of the rich Oriental rug centered in the room. Near the edges she could just see the hardwood floor underneath. A large, deep easy chair was pulled up to the windows and placed so it had a perfect view of the cathedral. An ornate chandelier hung over it with its wicks ready for the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still the need to go higher pulled her back to the stairs. They emerged into a round tower room, above the rest of the roof line and completely surrounded in windows. A huge four poster bed dominated the room, it’s blood red velvet curtains drawn back to reveal the black bed spread with a single red rose embroidered on it. Deep crimson silk sheets poked their tops from under the bed spread. It’s uprights and crosspieces were intricately woven wrought iron traceries. Lace curtains framed the windows while thicker ones brooded between them, waiting to close out the light, or hold it in at night. Toward the back of the buliding were  patio doors leading out onto a small balcony.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A teak wardrobe stood to the side of the stairs and a large trunk crouched at the foot of the bed. The cavern of the wardrobe barely noticed the meager stock of clothing within. A black cat suit hung next to three dark green flight suits, two pairs of jeans, and a couple of folded t shirts rested on the shelf. A worn pair of motorcycle boots with metal shin guards stood propped in a corner.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The trunk was also nearly empty, holding only a small oilskin pouch with a well crafted set of lock picking tools, a coil of climbing rope and a small bag of pitons with a hammer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The patio doors opened onto a small balcony that overlooked the roof line of the building. It looked down on a triangular section of roof that had been made into a garden. One either side were doors into the wings of the building that attached to the lower circular room she had just left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Curiosity dragged her away from the views and back down to the hallway. Halls led off to the left and the right. The door swung open to reveal a sky lit bathroom with an enormous claw footed tub. Ivy wove itself around the windows above the tub and up to a latticework near the skylight. She could just make out the railing of the balcony above through the twined leaves. A thick forest green throw rug masked the orange, red, and brown tile of the floor. Under the dust, fluffy purple towels hung expectantly on a brass rail, waiting invitingly for the next bather. Beyond the window was the roof garden. Bright flowers bloomed in the early morning light and a small fountain played in the center of an open area.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Turning back to the passageways she turned left and rounded a corner. The left wall was a series of windows looking out into the garden area and part way down on the right was another door. She stopped and opened it. Across from her were more windows. Mirrors lined the other three walls and a waist high brass rail encircled the room. A small stereo stood on a wheeled stand in the left corner near the windows. An impulse moved through her and soon she was half dancing, half just moving around the room. Small clouds of dust puffed up from her feet as she slowly warmed up. Somehow her muscles knew how to move, far better than they ever had before. Even the stiffness in her left shoulder was less noticeable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once her glance fell across herself in the mirror and she cringed at her reflection. She hadn't realized just how much weight she'd gained over the last year. The pudgy baby face her mom had given her was even more noticeable than it had been. So was the added thickness around her middle. Just like her mom she stacked it on in her stomach rather than her hips and thighs. Quickly she turned so she was looking out the windows as she moved.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took a while before curiosity pulled her out of movement and to the door at the end of the hall. Beyond it was a large study with an oak partners desk holding court in the room. The wall to her right was covered in bookshelves. The other three walls alternated between more shelves and windows revealing the garden, the back street, and the side street. The buildings beyond were slightly lower than the one she was in and showed jagged roof lines and intriguing oddities of angle. On the desk was a computer and keyboard. There was a door to the right of the one she entered through that led to the garden.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She crossed to it and stepped into the garden area. She wandered among the plants for a while, marveling at how healthy they were even though they showed signs of neglect. Someone had put a lot of work into the arrangement and care at one time. There was another door, almost directly across from the study that opened into a cavernous kitchen. A large brass rack hung from the ceiling in the center of the room and supported trailing ivy and large kitchen utensils. Beneath the rack was a butcher-block central island with a knife rack mounted on the side. An industrial size gas stove dominated the wall to her right and was backed by windows facing the road behind the building. On the wall to her left was an enormous icebox standing next to a door. On it was a poster of a ballet dancer in mid movement and the phrase, "Eat Right, Respect Your Body, Dance Forever". The door opened onto a hallway leading back into the rest of the apartment. It passed an empty room and emerged on the other side of the bathroom.</p>
