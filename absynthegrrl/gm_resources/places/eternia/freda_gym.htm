<p class="pagecaption">Freda's Gym</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Freda's is located in a block of older, run down buildings. It is a classic no frills gym. There is workout equipment, locker rooms with showers, weights, and a large room upstairs for aerobics and dance. There is a boxing ring in the basement and additional weights and workout areas. Also upstairs is a small office and locker room for use by the staff.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is not a meet-market gym. There is one of those in a more upscale area of Death City. Here people come to train and go home. Those who aren't serious about their workouts don't usually stay long.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Freda runs the gym and will work as a personal trainer for those that are serious about training. Mel is another staffer who oversees the gym and providers personal trainer assistance. Jessi is the dance and aerobics instructor. Most of her classes are in the evenings. Tuesday she has two intermediate classes and personal instruction times between the classes. Thursdays she has two beginner classes, wednesdays are the advanced class. Saturday, sunday, and mondays nights she has several different style aerobics classes. Jessi frequents the Cathouse on the friday nights when <a href="../../npcs/loves_bitch.htm">Love's Bitch</a> is playing.</p>
