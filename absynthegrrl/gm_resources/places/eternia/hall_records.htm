<p class="regtxt5">This is the facility where any recovered documents are kept. It is also the place where diaries, information, and logs from Eternia personnel are kept. Dementia started this going shortly after her arrival. Slowly it has grown into a vital resource. Not too long ago it recieved a significant boost in organization with the arrival of several historian recruits. Since their arrival Dementia has had more time to persue other concerns. Now it is common for one of the historians to go along on the more important rescue missions.</p>
