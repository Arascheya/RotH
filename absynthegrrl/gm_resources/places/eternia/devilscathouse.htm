<p class="pagecaption">Devil's Cathouse</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This Goth club is located in one of the crumbling industrial sections of Death City. It is a two level affair with the bar and dining tables set on the entry floor and the dance area in the old basement. There is a section in the center of the room where the flooring has been pulled up to reveal the dance floor below. To the right of the entrance are the stairs down to the dance area. It occupies part of an abandoned commercial building. Typically it opens around 8 and is open until first light.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Above the main level are two levels of various sized apartments. Erick lives in one of these. Dementia and Ennui live in the two tower-like projections on either end of the building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A variety of specialty drinks are available from the menu. Otherwise the selections are simple. A few types of good scotch, vodka, and schnapps, plus a good lager and a good stout.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The staff is mixed gothic and industrial types, tending toward elaborate costumes and affectations. <a href="../../npcs/dimentia.htm">Dementia</a>, the head bar-mistress is a tall, willowy, Morticia Addams looking young woman. She presides over the main bar. <a href="../../npcs/ennui.htm">Ennui</a> is shorter and very pale. She handles the secondary bar on the dance floor and oversees a small army of servers that prowl the floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mortiss handles some cleanup, bouncing on the rare occasions it's required, and general help. He also oversees the kitchen staff composed of Delerium and Dissolution.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"> Specialty drinks are dispensed from an elaborate glassware apparatus that sits behind the bar. It smokes, bubbles, and carries on like a demented science experiment from an old horror film. Stop-cocks regulate the mixing of the specialty drinks as they are created within it. There are two of these apparatus, one on the bar floor and one behind the secondary bar on the dance floor level. All drinks are served in various forms of lab glassware. For example, beer in large beakers, mixers in test tubes, erlenmeyer flasks, small beakers, or whatever is appropriate for the amount in a serving. Alien Blood and Morphine Drips are dispensed this way. Morphine Drips into test tubes and Alien Blood into the flasks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The house band is <a href="../../npcs/loves_bitch.htm">Love's Bitch</a>, a raucous, enthusiastic combination of Abney Park, Evanescence, and The Cruxshadows. They play two nights each week to a packed dance floor. Dementia is working to expand the dance area into an adjoining warehouse to make room. The band features the Cathouse's own Ennui on bass and vocals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Try for a blending of the Bronze, ie a cool place to hang, and the Coyote Bar, ie a wild place of hard driving music and craziness.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Notes on images:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Remove the ugly add-on on the front. Replace all tin siding with brick-work. Back loading area sits next to an unused rail siding where Leopardess will eventually stay between missions. The platform section will move out until it is even with the side of the building. This will allow it to function as a loading platform for trains. Remove all ugly paint and restore to worn brick look. Remove brick from widows and replace with windows into apartments and bar area.</p>
