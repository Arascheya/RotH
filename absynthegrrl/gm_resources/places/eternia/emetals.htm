<p class="regtxt5">This is a large foundry, smithy, and fabrication facility located in Goth City. This facility provides large metal items to Temple Heath for repair work. They also provide large metal works needed by others in Eternia. <a href="../../npcs/ron_o.htm">Ron Ostrander</a> is the Engineer and coordinator for the facility. He assigns incoming projects to the best team and oversees general operations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../npcs/rainy.htm">Renee "Rainy" Mirash</a> is the chief patern maker. She prepares the models, prototypes, and casts for the really difficult cast pieces. She also supervises the rest of the prototyping and fabricators.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../npcs/dimitri.htm">Dimitri Markov</a> is a bending wizard. When the final bending and forming of a difficult item occurs, he is the one that gets the job. He works very closely with <a href="../../npcs/rainy.htm">Rainy</a> for custom fabrications as well.</p>
