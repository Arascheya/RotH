<p class="regtxt5">Covered Promenade</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This section has totally collapsed. To get to the next section of the temple the party either has to hack its way through the vines and brush while stumbling over the wreckage. Or they need to make their way along the walls for the center rooms of this section of the temple.</p>
