<p class="regtxt5">Temple Entrance</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The unguarded steps lead up a broad walk that stretches the width of the temple. This walk is made of white stone that is weathered, stained and cracked. At the center point, a bridge stretches across the moat to connect with the island of buildings on the other side. The pools are empty and weed choked, the bridge is cracked and broken. Sections of it are no longer capable of holding weight.</p>
