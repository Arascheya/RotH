<p class="regtxt5">Library</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The books, scrolls, and wooden shelves have been consumed by the molds and mildews that now inhabit this room. In the far corner is a slime mold with acidic properties. Exposed flesh will be burned at the rate of 2 points per melee round until removed with alcohol.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is a fragment of a stone tablet under the slime mold that hints at the Dark Forces temple distribution map that can be found in the main section of the temple.</p>
