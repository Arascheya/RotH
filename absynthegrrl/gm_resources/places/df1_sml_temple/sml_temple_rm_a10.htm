<p class="pagecaption">Small Temple Room A10</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Scribes’ Hall</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This large chamber is arranged in multiple tiers of stone benches and desks. Rubble from the upper walls and ceiling along with roots and vines now chole most of it. Digging in the rubble will dislodge various biting crawling things. None of the bites are particularly dangerous, however they are exceedingly painful.</p>
