<p class="pagecaption">Small Temple Room C05</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Entrance Hall</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Standing to either side of the entrance to this area is a huge statue of a red and black streaked creature. These creatures have broad elephantine faces and sport horns and fangs. Their chests are a mass of wiry, matted tentacles. Their arms end in huge pincers. Their feet are clawed and webbed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The hall is choked with rubble from spot collapses in the ceiling. The only light filters through the plants choking the doorway.</p>
