<p class="regtxt5">Akhalt - place of power (from Paul Krumrey)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Devil cursed and demon haunted Akhalt, on the Plains of Neutral, where power mad sorcerers of yore called down to this earthly sphere a demon from beyond, to their unending sorrow...  Akhalt, where the Undying One rules from the Glowing Throne to this very day... doomed, cursed Akhalt, which the very gods spurned, transforming all the realm around it into a burning waste...</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Background:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Akhalt was formed when the great mages Tesch Mar and Nyigroth fought in the center of the sultanate of Kharatoum. This cataclysmic battle called forth destructive powers unrivalled since the Last War before the Ancients rose to power. Nyigroth detonated a thermonuclear device he had found. Tesch Mar countered with pulling energy down equivalent to a core tap regenerator pulse. The earth was scorched and laid waste. The rivers were dammed behind tons of displaced earth and everywhere destruction rained down upon the lands.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tesch Mar and Nyigroth disappeared in the titanic energies. No one knows whether they were displaced to another realm or if they were destroyed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tesch Mar was displaced to an as yet undetermined realm. Nyigroth was spit forth from the Gate at Skelos, into the heart of Margla’s majik school. There he sowed the seeds that led to the war of Skelos, a splintering of the great school and the destruction of a golden age for Arcanes there. During the battle Margla lost the ring Thock now has.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Back inKharatoum, now known as the Galhai Wastes, a young adventuring Arcane came across the Hand and Eye of Azeloth, two items that had been in Nyigroth’s possession. Also in the wreckage was the globe of invulnerability containing Kalyana’s body.</p>
