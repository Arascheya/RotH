<p class="pagecaption">Lestrade and Petrie Booksellers</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This bookstore is located at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Baker+St,+London,+United+Kingdom&hl=en&ll=51.52382,-0.158305&spn=0.001257,0.002873&sll=37.269174,-119.306607&sspn=13.15369,23.532715&oq=baker+st.,+london&hq=Baker+St,&hnear=London,+United+Kingdom&t=h&fll=51.523646,-0.158401&fspn=0.001257,0.002873&z=19&layer=c&cbll=51.52382,-0.158305&panoid=XgLIs2ebsRAKR-aStjh8KA&cbp=12,246,,0,-0.42">221B Baker St.</a> and takes up the spaces occupied by the Sherlock Holmes Museum and Kinleigh Folkard & Hayward Estate Agents. <!--down a dark alley-like street, in a section of London near the Temple areas.--> It has been in the Lestrade family for generations. <a href="../npcs/lestrade.htm">Inspector Lestrade</a> started it with his wife and his best friend, <a href="../npcs/petrie.htm">John Petrie</a>, when the inspector retired from Scotland Yard in the late 1890s.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bookshop takes up the first (street) level. Ange's family lives in the flats above. The archives extend deep below street level and evolved in an organic manner. As a result, it takes weeks for new employees to figure out where anything is. The archives are protected by energy barrier technology woven into the fabric of the structers and excavations. These were obtained from Irena and the Hut. The family has bolt-hole living quarters deep in the archives, but haven't had to use them. They can double as guest rooms for anyone not wanting to attract a lot of attention. There are tunnels to the Baker Street tube station and the Marleybone Station. Both exit in out of the way places where it would be hard to detect the comings and goings of any visitors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is always a selection of inexpensive used books for the thrifty. Behind the normal retail areas, where new and used common books are displayed, is a vast network of rooms containing rare, hard to find, and one of a kind items from throughout the centuries. These tomes can be accessed online, for a transcription fee. Many books have been transcribed over the years that networking has been available. In all cases, the transcription fee must be paid as a way to subsidize the work and the network connections to make them available. It requires very special requests and a high degree of cash and/or trust to gain access to the original materials.</p>
