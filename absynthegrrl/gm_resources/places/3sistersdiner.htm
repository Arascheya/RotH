<p class="regtxt5">The diner is located in the brick building to the right in the picture. It is next to <a href="underground.htm">The Underground</a> club.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The 3 Sisters Diner was started by Rhianna and Farahd Ahzahd and named for their three daughters. They bought the diner when they immigrated from Presaara. The diner serves traditional Presaaran Cuisine and easy Meriksan favorties in an informal setting.They focus on inexpensive, filling meals for people on the go. They have only recently added a more elaborate dinner menu, to cater to the gentrification of the Underland region. It has proven a rousing success. They are open twenty four hours a day</p>

<p class="regtxt5">INyasha, Mizyhra, and Adalaath are the three sisters the diner was named after. Adalaath is the oldest at 38, followed by Mizyhra at 30, and Inyasha is the youngest, at 22.</p>
