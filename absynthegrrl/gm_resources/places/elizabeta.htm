<p class="regtxt5">The Elizabeta is a hotel and condominium building in the upper west side of Yew Nork. It is privately held by the Mason family, who bought it after many years of negelect, in the late 70's. It has been restored to the glory it was at its construction and is once again, available for rent or ownership. It has been lovingly restored to its original glory, including the restoration of the skylight over the main staircase.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Elizabeta offeres rooms and suites for the more well to do traveller and apartments from studios to palacial suites for owning or renting. In a nod to the artistic residents of the past, one quarter of the apartments are kept at affordable pricing. These are highly valued and each one has an increidbly long waiting list.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Elizabeta was named for an aunt of the original owner.</p>
