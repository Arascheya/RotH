      <H1 align=center>New Scotland Yard </H1>
      <P>This red and white brick Victorian Gothic building designed by Norman 
      Shaw was located on Victoria Embankment, SW1 adjacent to Cannon Row police 
      station and built specifically to be the new Police Headquarters. </P>

      <P align=center class=photocapcentre><I>The Norman Shaw Building of New 
      Scotland Yard on the Embankment </I></P>
      <P>The building was the site of the unsolved Whitehall Mystery (1888) when 
      a woman's torso was concealed in the cellar by night as the building work 
      was in progress. Its main gates provided a background in many police 
      films, and it held the original telephone number Whitehall 1212. However, 
      the offices were cramped and inadequate and relocation was made essential 
      by the 1960s. </P>

      <P align=center class=photocapcentre><I>The new headquarters in Broadway, 
      1967 </I></P>
      <P>From 1967 the Metropolitan Police Headquarters have been located at 10 
      Broadway, SW1. This is a plain aluminium-clad office block behind St 
      James's Park Underground Station. Its most famous feature is the revolving 
      sign outside, which performs over 14,000 revolutions every day.</P>
