<p class="pagecaption">Waverly's Pub</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Waverly's is owned by Tom O'Malley, who claims to be a descendent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_O%27Malley">Grace O'Malley</a>, the Irish pirate queen b. 1530 d. 1603. He runs the pub his grandfather built and oversees Grainne Ni Mhaille Holdings, which controls several properties in the neighborhood. It started as an authentic Irish pub, serving the working class residents of the neighborhood. Once Irena started managing it, one year after she was hired, Irena turned the basement into a Goth club, called Waverly's. <a href="../npcs/uru_irena.htm">Irena</a> manages both sections for Tom, now that he is in his early 70's.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../npcs/uru_irena.htm">Irena</a> and <a href="../npcs/uru_shandi.htm">Shandi</a> rent the largest apartment above the pub. There are three other apartments that can be rented out. Once Irena takes ownership she keeps one open as guest quarters for friends. <a href="../npcs/uru_shandi.htm">Shandi</a> used to work at the pub until she moved to the gaming company.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tom has no heirs and is considering passing the pub to Irena. He hasn't told her at the time of the start of the stories. It can come out as things progress. He will do the transfer as a sale of business interests with the proviso that they split the profits and that Irena doesn't change the names of the pubs until he is gone. Currently Tom has been keeping the profits and giving Irena and the employees decent bonuses each year. Tom owns the entire downtown block that Waverly's is in. He sells the entire holding to Irena. Tom lives in the top floor of the building housing O'Malley's. He will remain until his passing, then Irena and Nyissa will move in there and rent the large apartment over Waverly's.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Waverly's is actually two bars, O'Malley's, the Irish pub and Waverly's, the goth venue. Waverly's books goth and industrial bands from all over and has been known to sponsor large shows at the local amphitheatre. Being booked into Waverly's is considered "arriving" if you are a local band. This makes Waverly's a contact spot for emerging talent. Waverly's is in the basement of the building and is heavily sound insulated to prevent disturbancesto O'Malleys and the apratments above.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">O'Malley's is styled after a traditional Eirleandra pub, just down the street from where Tom's family lived. It is on the second floor and takes up the space in the mainbuilding. The tent area is a summer deck.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The third floor houses rental apartments and the top floor is where Irean and Nyissana have their apartment. There is also a spare apartment, that they keep open for friends.Irena's apartment is in the back half of the third floor. The spare apartment is in the front.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* city, Cagocha, is modelled after Chicago, O'Malley's Pub is in the Cable House building, rest of the block contains mixed dwellings and businesses. There has been a lot of pressure over the years to sell for development. Tom has refused, liking the older feel of the block and hating the glass and steel uglies nearby - the block should be older brick buildings and stone buildings similar to the pub in feel - buildings should be mixed use, apratments over retail, retail would be coffee, books, food, upscale boutique kinds of things - block should be favorite hang-out for university crowd and could be in a location similar to the current location of aquarium, etc. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tom's Holdings - Grainne Ni Mhaille Holdings, named after a long lost relative. This company owns four sections of land in downtown Cagocha. Tom has trusted managers handling property management for the holdings. He is quite rich from the value of the assetts plus the income they generate. Irena has no idea until she signs the paperwork for transfer and is briefed by the managers and legal team.See GEarth locations for where the properties are.</p>
