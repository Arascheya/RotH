<p class="pagecaption">Level 666 of the Abyss - Succubi</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This realm contains the succubi. It is an old Level, with a rich history of rise, fall, and rise again. It is a place of desert, oceans, and towering cities. Some lie in ruins, some are fully functioning, and some are remants of old glories.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The realm was ruled by Iskandera, until a coup forced her to flee. This coup brought on a period of decline as the members of the coup fought among themselves once Iskandera was defeated.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../npcs/iskandera.htm">Arascheya ni Iskandera</a>'s two daughters took back the realm after the creation of the <a href="../planescape/asylumflowers.htm">Asylum</a> Tactical Teams in <a href="../planescape/centrys.htm">Sphere</a>. This was the first instance of the <a href="../planescape/asylumflowers.htm">Asylum</a> Tactical Teams being used for non-<a href="../planescape/asylumflowers.htm">Asylum</a> reasons.</p>
