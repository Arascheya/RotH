<p class="pagecaption">Kali-Yuga Temple</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Amidst the myriad wild vistas of Limbo, there lies a realm known only as the Endless Chasm, wherein one might fall between the planes should they but lose their footing. Within this dangerous expanse, there lies a small island of relative stability upon which there was built, of old, a temple hewn from the rocky cliffs that dominate the surface of the isle. None know, to what deity the temple was dedicated! Yet, within it's confines an evil jewel is entwined within the branches of a blood-red tree and pulses with a bright life of it's own above the four heads of an idol to some forgotten goddess. Since long ages beyond counting, others have erected many a monument of their own near the temple, but all now lie abandoned with the passing of the ages... their ruins left for adventurers to explore. Only a single name is known to sages who speak of this place, and it is this which so gives the ancient area it's much-feared name: Kali-Yuga. Kali-Yuga the Lost.</p>
