<p class="pagecaption">Level 665 of the Abyss - Spider Beings</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The residents of Level 665 are spider based beings. These come in many types, from the miriad types of spiderkin up to the Spider Born. It is a realm of forests and rocky outcropping, providing ample areas to string webs, create housing, and find food.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spiderkin range in intelligence from near sentient to basic spider-like functioning. They are cared for and nurtured by the Spider Born.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spider Born are the fully sentient beings of the Level. They are typically highly intelligent, social, at least among their own, and cooperative enough to form a civilization in the Level.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spider Born can easily assume three shapes, fully spider, although very large, drider, and fully humanoid. The form switching is an inate skill, that requires only development during the Spider Born's maturation.</p>
