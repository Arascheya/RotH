<p class="regtxt5">These were engineered worlds, created by the Creation Team in a dynamically stabilized pattern of one world on each side of the sun, positioned in the same orbital path, and held there by a dynamic control system embedded in each planet. Power is derived from planetary core heat and this is replenished by a solar energy to core heat exchange process. The control system and tapping system can be accessed through the Gigabolt mountains.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This was one of the last projects of the Creation Team before they disappeared from the galactic environs. As a result some unexpected or unresolved issues remained. One was a viral form that would slowly destroy higher brain functions in any organism on the worlds. The original experimental life-forms established by the CT died out from this issue. It also nearly destroyed the Karanal survivors after they arrived through the <a href="../gates_inx.htm">World Gate</a>.</p>
