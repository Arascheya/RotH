<p class="regtxt5">After taking massive falling damage Thock washed up here, unconcious and with very few HP left.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At the first door he comes to after awakening he will hear the following conversation. The three talkers are orcs.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">1 - At last, we get some visitors.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">2 - Hush, they might hear you. Besides, the old fool pays us whether we work or not.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">3 - I like the pretty one. She has a wicked sense of humor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">2 - But she isn't the one paying us.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">1 - I don't think the old guy likes her much anymore.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">2 - Shut up you. You know it isn't wise to talk about him</p>
