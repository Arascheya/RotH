<p class="pagecaption">Granite <a href="sphinxweb.htm">Sphynx</a> - (ENELSECRET)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Found in tunnels below the Enelman estate in Miskaton. Why this one is so far from the main walks of life is a mystery. Maybe it was placed more prominently in the past and then it was swallowed up by changes in Miskaton.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Its inscription is in plan text and says: "I am the way to knowledge and power. Those that follow in my footsteps are destined to be great leaders. Find my brother in the jungles of the elephant and you will be on your way. (ENELSECRET)"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A second line has been added in some kind of reddish paint saying, "Pretentious twaddle. Knowledge is found in all walks of life and power is an illusion. Yet this path might be worth a look." The script is flowing and beautiful. Heriskath would recognize it as being <a href="../gm_resources/npcs/kayara.htm">Vishina</a>'s script from the various examples she has seen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a hidden compartment, set to open to any of <a href="../gm_resources/eritsani_inx.htm">T'Sani</a> blood, that contains a <a href="new_hiero_xlate.jpg">translation sheet</a> for the script used on additional sphynxes, the <a href="../gm_resources/items/trickster_ring.htm">Trickster's Ring</a>, and a more detailed note in the same script as the painted text on the statue. The <a href="../gm_resources/items/trickster_ring.htm">Trickster's Ring</a> is a one time only, placed for Gamino. Otherwise this compartment contains a <a href="../gm_resources/items/ring_key.htm">Ring Key</a> instead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Note:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You of T'Sani blood, who have been reviled and spit upon by the Static, the landed, the "established", to you are granted the secrets of the multi-verse. Look for more of these notes, placed within the receptacles of the Insane One, to help you along your way. In this way his crazy path of vain-glory may actually provide enlightenment.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I will be leaving various interesting bits for you as well. I start with this fragment of a manuscript by Sri Yugaswar Devi, a noted plane wanderer and resident of the Sultanate of Kharatoum.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">We left Centrys for the Sphere of Concordant Discord, through a Door we knew to be safe. Knowledge and safety are an illusory thing as we found when we stepped into a strange realm. Ancient megalithic ruins thrust up from dark, tangled forests. Sharp mountain peaks thrust high into the sky and cast deep shadowy gloom over the narrow valley we were in. Soft footfalls paced through the branches above and beside us. Strange bird-like calls sounded forlorn in the still air. Now anf then a puff of wind would stir the higher branches, rubbling them against each other in strange rythms.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">We wandered narrow valleys and thick tangles for days, seeking a Door back to Centrys, or to anywhere else. When we had given up all hope we stumbled across another path, one we had not seen the night before. It wound directly toward one of the towering ruins, climbing a steep stair to a high platform. Below us was one of the valleys, spread out in a canopy of dense brush. A dark doorway yawned behind us. Desperate to leave, we stepped through and onto a narrow strip of dark grey sand.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The dense forest and the valleys were gone. Black void dropped off from both sides of us. Behind us the tongue ended abruptly in nothingness. Ahead was a low cluster of rocks. In front of us a high rock wall faced us. Set into its face was a giant iron door, set between shaply pillars. In an alcove above the door a featureless female statue stared out into the void. Above us was a canopy of stars and a strange swirling pool of light.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The doors would not open to any of our attempts. Ibrahmah attempted to climb around the statue and encountered a clear barrier just behind it. Within the cavernous room he could see giant statues and a deep pit. Above the pit a glowing red crystal pulsed and shone. He tried to find a lock to pick on the doors but there was none. Kalyana attempted to use her arcane skills to open the door, but was unable to as well. We resorted to walking the perimiter of the rock chamber, finding five more doors, all sealed as effectively as the first.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">On top of a smaller temple, the only one of the ruins in any sort of shape, we found a strange scrying device. It was of dark metal, pitted with age, yet still whole and solid. As Kalyana approached it, it sprang to life. An image floated upon its surface of a giant surface of fire, pulsing red and angry. Cryptic runes appeared near the bottom of the image as the image entered the fire and passed into a blackness so complete it forced the eye to the firy white sphere seen far in the distance.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The runes <a href="/* insert graphic link here */">read</a>: Time Probe 666 - sent to pre-time through gate one - mission start</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The sphere drew swiftly closer and as it came we saw streamers and tendrils rushing out from it, forming into little clouds and these clouds were pulled and sucked into a blackness blacker even the the balck surrounding it. Small motes of light flashed and danced where the deeper black met the firy white.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The cryptic runes flashed again as we saw the little motes swirl together, becomeing a small white light, a small grey blob, and a tiny blacker than black dot. They moved with a sudden swiftness that pulled a gasp from us and violent purple beams lept from them, pinning the large white sphere and the large darkness. The beams twisted and turned, weaving enormous cages of webbing and then a blueish white flash blinded us. When next we could see, only the three smaller spots remained. Small fires sped from the bright one, becoming as stars in the sky, one sped directly at us and when it flared red-orange across the viewer, blackness closed over us.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The second runes <a href="/* insert graphic link here */">read</a>: Indeterminant time shift - mission time - indeterminant - time coords impossible to compute</p>

<p class="regtxt12">We awoke in the gardens of the Sultan, to the ministrations of his personal physician and several serving maids.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">/* they will find their way to the Repository and be tended by the Keepers, before being gated back to Centrys. They were never able to find the temple, the valleys, or the Repository again */</p>

<p class="regtxt12">/* find this either on the walls of the temple or through the keepers in the Repository */</p>
