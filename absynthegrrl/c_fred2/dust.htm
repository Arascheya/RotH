<p class="pagecaption">Labyrinth Dust</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This dust is a fine powdery feeling grey dust. It has the feel of the perfect dust on a country road in the warm sun. It makes you want to walk bare foot through it, just for the sensuous treat of it. The dust moves and flows into a smooth surface. Tracks disappear in minutes after they are made. The dust is anywhere from one to three meters deep depending on location.  <a href="../gm_resources/monsters/dustskim.htm">Dust skimmers</a> swim through the dust in random patterns.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">All non-living things will sink into the dust. This includes dead bodies, so looting must be accomplished fairly quickly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To allow non-living items to remain available for the various visitors to the labyrinth Tyana can activate a protective field to keep them on the surface. If it is an item to be taken, the field will drop as soon as a character picks up the item. For stationary items the field remains in place.</p>
