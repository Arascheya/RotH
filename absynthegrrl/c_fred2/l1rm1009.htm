<p class="pagecaption">Labyrinth Level 1 Room 1009</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This room is not entirely to scale. This is a teleport point to the cantina facility for CF2. Here the monsters and even the adventurers can sit down in peace. An immediate stasis field is imposed on any attempting to attack any other while in here. There is a full service bar and cafeteria as well as numerous tables and booths for lounging and taking one's ease.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are entry points to this facility from all levels. When entering the entity is tagged by Tyana and returned to their entry location when they leave. Only employees may use the cantina to change locations of entry, and then only those allowed this facility by the controllers of CF2.</p>
