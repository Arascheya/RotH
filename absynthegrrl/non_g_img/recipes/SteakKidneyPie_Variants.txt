Printed from COOKS.COM

3 lbs. bottom round steak
1 calf or beef kidney
Pastry for 2 crust pie
1 med. onion, diced
1/2 lb. mushrooms, sliced (opt.)
Salt & pepper to taste
Worcestershire sauce to taste
2 pkgs. brown gravy mix
2 c. water

Oven temperature: 350 degrees.

Cover kidney with warm water and soak for approximately 1 hour. Cut steak into bite size pieces. Cut kidney into bite size pieces. Put meat into a small bowl and season with salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce.

Leave stand for about 15 minutes. Toss meat with flour. In a heavy skillet saute onions and mushrooms (if used). Add meat and brown on all sides.

Sprinkle with gravy mix and toss add water and stir. Simmer for 30 minutes.

Make your favorite pastry or use a ready made pastry shell, line a 9" pie plate.

Fill with steak and kidney mixture, cover with pastry. Brush top crust with a mixture of a beaten egg and 2 tablespoons milk.

Bake for 1 hour. Pastry will be a golden brown. Make sure you add all the gravy, or the pie will be dry.

This is a time consuming recipe, but for special occasions it is worth the time taken. If you really hate to make pastry, I have found that the Pillsbury Ready Pastry works very well.

STEAK & KIDNEY PIE
Printed from COOKS.COM

2 lb. bottom round or chuck steak, cut into slices 1" to 1 1/2" thick
1 lb. veal or 1/2 lb. lamb kidneys
1/2 lb. mushrooms
1/4 c. flour
Butter or oil
Salt & freshly ground pepper
3/4 lb. onion, cut into 1/2" cubes
1/2 tsp. minced garlic
6 c. beef broth
3 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
1 tbsp. Louisiana Red Hot Sauce (not Tabasco)
1 tbsp. tomato paste
1/4 tsp. dried thyme
Pie pastry

1. Cut steak into 1" to 1 1/2" squares.

2. Trim away and discard the white tough core and sinews from the kidneys and cut into 1/2" cubes.

3. Coat the steak and kidney separately with seasoned flour. Toss well to blend. Shake off excess.

4. Cut the mushrooms into quarters or slices or leave whole, depending on size.

5. Heat the butter or oil in a heavy skillet and lightly brown the steak. Put on only a few pieces at a time to insure they are sealed on all sides. Remove, then brown the kidney. Place steak and kidney in warm dish.

6. Saute the onion until wilted. Add mushrooms and garlic until mushrooms start to brown. Remove to a 4 or 5 quart cooking pot over low medium heat and add tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce and thyme.

7. Slowly add sufficient stock, stirring all the time, until it becomes a gravy. Add seasoned flour if needed. Bring to a boil and cook about 5 minutes.

8. Season to taste and place steak and kidney in the cooking pot and add additional stock so that the meat is almost covered. Cover with lid, place in 300 degree oven and bake about 1 1/2 hours or until steak is thoroughly tender. If the liquid level drops, add more beef stock. Cool and refrigerate overnight.

9. Spoon meat and sauce into an 8-cup baking pan (oval dish measuring 13"x8"x2" is ideal). The pie should have plenty of gravy and not become dry. Brush around outside edge of baking dish with beaten egg. Cover with pie crust. Decorate with pastry cut outs. Cut hole 1" or smaller in the center of the pastry and a few slashes to allow steam to escape. Brush with a little beaten egg. Set dish on a flat pan and place in oven. Bake at 425 degrees for 40 minutes for a large single dish or 32 minutes for small individual oval dishes.

10. Pie Pastry: 2 cups flour, 2/3 cup Crisco, salt to taste and 4 to 5 tablespoons ice water. Put flour and salt in mixing bowl. Add Crisco and cut it in with 2 knives or pastry blender until mixture looks like coarse cornmeal. Using fork, start tossing mixture while adding water. Add just enough water until dough holds together. Shape dough into ball. Wrap in waxed paper and chill overnight or for at least 12 hours. Roll as needed.
