Pecan Pralines

vegetable oil for baking sheets
2 cups firmly packed light brown sugar (a 1-pound box)
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, cut into bits
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
2 1/2 cups pecan halves

Oil 3 baking sheets lightly.

In a 2-quart heavy saucepan combine sugars, cream, salt, and cream of tartar and cook mixture over moderate heat, stirring and washing down any sugar crystals clinging to side with a brush dipped in cold water, until sugar is dissolved.

Boil mixture, undisturbed, over moderately high heat until a candy thermometer registers 238°F. Remove pan from heat and cool mixture, undisturbed, until thermometer registers 220°F. Stir in butter and vanilla. Beat mixture until creamy and stir in pecan halves. Drop tablespoons of mixture quickly onto prepared baking sheets and let harden.

Store pralines, wrapped individually in wax paper, in an airtight container in a cool place. Pralines keep up to 2 weeks.

Makes 2 pounds, about 36 pralines.
