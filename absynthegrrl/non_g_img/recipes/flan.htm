<p class="regtxt5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">For the caramel syrup</p>

<p class="regtxt12">3/4 cup sugar</p>

<p class="regtxt12">2 to 3 tablespoons water</p>
<p class="regtxt9">For the custard</p>

<p class="regtxt12">2 cups whole milk</p>

<p class="regtxt12">1 cup half-and-half</p>

<p class="regtxt12">2 vanilla beans</p>

<p class="regtxt12">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>

<p class="regtxt12">5 large eggs</p>

<p class="regtxt12">1/3 cup sugar</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Equipment</p>

<p class="regtxt12">1-quart saucepan</p>

<p class="regtxt12">a soufflé dish with 3-inch sides or 6 small ramekins</p>

<p class="regtxt12">2-quart saucepan with cover</p>

<p class="regtxt12">a wire whisk</p>

<p class="regtxt12">a sieve</p>

<p class="regtxt12">2 mixing bowls</p>

<p class="regtxt12">a paring knife</p>

<p class="regtxt12">a baking pan with 2-inch sides (for water bath)</p>

<p class="regtxt12">a large serving plate or 6 small serving plates</p>
<p class="regtxt9"></p>
<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Directions:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">For the caramel syrup</p>

<p class="regtxt12">1. Put the sugar in the 1-quart saucepan and stir in enough water to moisten all the sugar. Heat gently until the sugar is dissolved. Then bring to a rapid boil and cook for several minutes until caramel-colored. Do not stir. (Large, thick bubbles let you know that caramelization is about to take place - have your soufflé dish or ramekins ready.)</p>

<p class="regtxt15">The temperature needs to be well above 300° F, so the sugar crystals will melt.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">2. Pour the caramel syrup into your soufflé dish or ramekins, making sure that the bottom is evenly covered.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">For the custard</p>

<p class="regtxt12">1. Preheat the oven to 325° F.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">2. Put the milk and half-and-half into the 2-quart saucepan, add the vanilla beans, and heat to a boil. Cover and remove from heat; leave for 5 minutes.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">3. Put the eggs in a mixing bowl and gradually blend in the sugar, stirring with the whisk until the sugar dissolves. Don’t incorporate air into the mixture.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">4. Remove the vanilla beans from the milk/cream mixture, and slowly pour the milk into the eggs while stirring gently with the whisk.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Tip - Vanilla beans can be reused, although, without the seeds, the flavor will be less intense. Just wash and dry them, then store them in a glass jar.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">5. Put the sieve over the second mixing bowl and strain the milk/egg mixture through it.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Straining the mixture removes the chalazae, the cords that hold the yolk in place in the raw egg. Removing the chalazae will result in a smoother flan.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">6. Wipe any milk off the vanilla beans and slit them lengthwise. Use the tip of the knife to scrape out the black seeds from the beans. Add the seeds to the custard mixture along with the vanilla extract.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">7. Pour the custard into the soufflé dish or ramekins.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">8. Place your dish or dishes in the baking pan and put the pan in the oven. Add hot water (not boiling; just hot tap water) until it reaches about halfway up the sides of your dish or dishes. Bake for about 35 minutes if you’re using ramekins; about 50 minutes if you’re using a soufflé dish. Check the water bath from time to time to make sure it isn’t boiling; add ice cubes if necessary.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">A water bath (bain marie; baño de María) provides an even, moderate temperature. If the flan cooks too rapidly, it will look like a sponge. The proteins will have toughened, squeezing out liquid - a process known as syneresis.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Eggs in general are best cooked with gentle heat. Otherwise, they become tough and rubbery.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">9. Your flan should be done when it’s lightly colored and firm to the touch but not solid. To double check, stick the blade of your knife in the center of the flan and halfway down; the blade should come out clean. Carefully remove the baking pan from the oven, then remove the flan from the water bath. Let the flan cool to room temperature, then chill, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">10. To remove your flan, run your knife between the side of the custard and its container. Put a serving plate on top of the dish and quickly invert the two. Then lift the dish straight up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Notes:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The origins of flan can be traced to early Roman times. The invention of baked custard - containing eggs, milk, and honey - is attributed to Marcus Apicius, a cookbook writer from about the first century. (Translations of his work are still available today.)</p>
