mushroom and green bean salad

1 lb French green beans (haricots verts) or use regular green beans and cut as desired
1/2 lb fresh mushrooms (Italian browns if possible), stems removed and caps thinly sliced
2 ounces California goat cheese (fresh feta)
Finely minced parsley and chives or other fresh herbs such as basil, tarragon or chervil, to taste
2 tomatoes, quartered or whole cherry or current tomatoes, optional
1/3 cup walnut halves, toasted and chopped, optional

VINAIGRETTE SAUCE:
2 teaspoons Dijon-style mustard
1 tablespoon lemon juice or white wine vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil (if you use walnuts in the salad, use walnut oil)
2 tablespoons minced chives
2 tablespoon minced parsley
Salt and freshly ground pepper
pinch of sugar, optional

Trim green beans, and cut to desired size. Blanch beans in rapidly boiling water until just tender or cooked as desired. Taste! Do not overcook. Drain and run under cold water to stop further cooking. Pat dry and transfer to a bowl and set aside. This may be done 1 day ahead.

In your food processor or blender, combine the ingredients for the vinaigrette, process until well blended. Season to taste. This may be completed 1 day ahead.

To serve, toss mushrooms and green beans in a bowl with the dressing, and season to taste with additional salt a freshly ground pepper. Transfer to a shallow serving bowl or platter. Arrange tomato wedges (or whole tomatoes) around the serving dish and garnish with fresh herbs; then sprinkle with cheese and walnuts.
