Quick Spicy Kimchee

1 head napa cabbage, about 1 to 1.5 pounds
1/4 cup kosher salf
1/2 cup rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoons hot chili paste (recommended Srirachi Hot Chili Paste)
1 inch fresh ginger, grated
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 scallions, finely sliced

Remove outer leaves from cabbage. Cut cabbage into quarters and remove the tough inner core. Slice across sections into 1/2 inch slices. Put into colander, add salt, and mix well. Place over a bowl and let drain, covered, until wilted, about 2 hours.

In a large bowl combine the vinegar and sugar, stir to disolve. Add chili paste, ginger, garlic, and scallions and stir. Rinse the salt off the cabbage with a couple of changes of water. Dry well and add to the vinegar mixture; stir well to combine. Put into sanatized glass jar and pack the cabbage down; add enough water to cover. Close jar and refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving. This gets spicier the longer it sits.
