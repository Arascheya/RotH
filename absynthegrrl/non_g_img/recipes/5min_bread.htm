<p class="sectioncaption">Whole Wheat - variant 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1 1/2 tbsp granulated yeast (1 1/2 packets)</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1 tbsp plus 1 tsp salt</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1/2 cup honey</p>
<p class="regtxt9">5 tbsp neutral-flavored oil, plus more for greasing the pan</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1 1/2 cups lukewarm milk</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1 1/2 cups lukewarm water</p>
<p class="regtxt9">6 2/3 cups whole wheat flour</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Directions:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">1. Mix the yeast, salt, honey, oil, milk and water in a 5-quart bowl or other container.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">2. Mix in the flour using a spoon, high-capacity food processor with dough attachment, or a heavy-duty stand mixer with dough hook.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">3. Cover loosely, and allow to rest at room temperature until the dough rises and collapses (or flattens on top); about 2 to 3 hours.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">4. The dough can be used immediately after the initial rise, though it is easier to handle when cold. Refrigerate in a lidded (not airtight) container and use over the next several days.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">5. On baking day, lightly grease a 9-by-4-by-3-inch loaf pan. Using wet hands, scoop out a 11/2 pound (cantaloupe-sized) hunk of dough. Keeping your hands wet (it’ll be sticky!), quickly shape it into a ball following the method in Step 5 of The Master Recipe (above).</p>

<p class="regtxt9">6. Drop the loaf into the prepared pan. You’ll want enough dough to fill the pan slightly more than half-full.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">7. Allow the dough to rest for 1 hour and 40 minutes. Flour the top of the loaf and slash, using the tip of a serrated bread knife.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">8. 5 minutes before baking time, preheat the oven to 350 degrees, with an empty broiler tray on another shelf.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">9. Place the loaf in the center of the oven. Pour 1 cup of hot water into the broiler tray and quickly close the door. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until deeply browned and firm.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">10. Allow to cool completely before slicing in order to cut reasonable sandwich slices.</p>
