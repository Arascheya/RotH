<p class="pagecaption">Sourdough Starter info</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is from the <a href="http://www.cowboyshowcase.com/sourdough.htm">Cowboy Showcase</a> site.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The sourdough starter is the basic ingredient for everything you will make that's called sourdough whatever. Sourdough is simply home-grown yeast!  Given the hosts of flour and warm water, the yeast spores break down the starch into sugar, permitting fermentation to take place. In bread baking, the sourdough acts primarily as the leavening or raising agent. The sourdough base is often called a sponge and from it springs bread, biscuits and flapjacks. The sponge has also been used to heal burns and wounds and even make a kind of hooch. Sourdough fed generations of miners, trappers, mountain men and pioneers--and, later on, farm and city families.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are two ways of getting sourdough starter: make it or else get some from a friend. Starter can easily be maintained for years if treated properly. Sooner or later you'll do something stupid and lose your starter. No need to fret, my friend, just mix up another new batch. Keep the working starter in any kind of a coverable container, crock, mason jar or the like, but don't ever store the starter in a metal container. Before using the crock, mason jar, etc. scald the container well to kill unwanted bacteria spores. Old timers say that in cold weather the starter will lose some of it's potency so revive it with a tablespoon of pure cider vinegar. The lid to the container should never be tightly closed or sealed in order to permit yeast spores to be attracted from the surrounding air...and allow the sponge to vent gas to the atmosphere</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The real sourdough starter, like the old timers used, did not use yeast! The less yeast used the richer and headier the sourdough becomes but the trickier the recipes are.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Here's a recipe for sourdough starter made from scratch without using yeast:  Mix two cups of all purpose flour with enough lukewarm water to form a thick batter. Let this stand uncovered for four to five days, or until it begins working. This basic recipe requires storage in a well scalded container.  An alternate is to use warm milk in place of the lukewarm water.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Somewhere along the trail I picked up the following method for making the sourdough starter: mix one cup of flour with one cup of room temperature water. Cover the mixture and let stand in a warm place overnight. Next morning add one cup of flour and about a cup of room temperature water. Mix well, cover and let stand in a warm place for up to twenty-four hours. Repeat the adding of flour and water at least one more time then let the mixture stand and work in a warm place for a day or so until you see a lot of foam and bubbles on top of the starter. The starter is now ready to use.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">In times gone by, most people made their starter by mixing enough flour with water in which potatoes had been boiled to make a thick batter... let stand a day or two or else until it smelled right.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Here's another method of making starter: Mix four cups of flour, two tablespoons of salt, two tablespoons sugar, four cups lukewarm potato water in a crock or jar and let stand uncovered in a warm place for several days.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">And finally, let one cup of milk stand uncovered a day or so at room temperature then add a cup of flour, mix well and let the mess stand a couple of days at which time it's ready to use.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">If starter is normally kept in the refrigerator take it out several hours in advance of use or until it is at room temperature.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After each use be sure to replenish the starter by adding enough flour and water to restore the mixture to its original consistency and let the sponge work in the container at least a day before storage back in the refrigerator. Note: a teaspoon of sugar may be added to the starter during the replenishment.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Here’s another starter recipe called "Herman" as passed on to me by Mrs. Kim Kendall of the Peeples Valley community in Arizona. Dissolve I pkg. of dry yeast in ½ cup of warm water. When the yeast and water begin to foam mix in 2 teaspoons of sugar or honey, 2-1/2 cups flour and the remaining water [2 cups]. Store in a sterilized large glass jar (crock or plastic jar are OK too). Cover with clear plastic wrap. No Metal is ever permitted to come in contact with the starter. Keep at room temperature for 24 - 48 hours. The mixture will bubble up and should be stirred down and then placed in the refrigerator. Stir daily with wooden or plastic spoon. On 5th day feed Herman: 1 cup flour, 1 cup of milk and ½ cup sugar and stir well. On 10th day take out 2 cups of the starter for baking , then feed same ingredients as on 5th day to keep starter going/working.</p>
