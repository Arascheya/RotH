<p class="pagecaption">7 Grain Bread</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1-1/4 cup 7 grain hot cereal mix</p>
<p class="regtxt9">2-1/2 cup boiling water</p>
<p class="regtxt9">3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1-1/2 cups whole wheat flour</p>
<p class="regtxt9">4 tablespoons honey</p>
<p class="regtxt9">4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly</p>
<p class="regtxt9">2-1/2 teaspoons dry yeast (1 package)</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1 tablespoon salt</p>
<p class="regtxt9">3/4 cup sunflower or pumpkin seeds, unsalted</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1/2 cup oats</p>
<p class="regtxt9"></p>
<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Directions:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Place cereal in mixing bowl and pour boiling water over it. Let stand, stiring occasionally, until misxture cools to 100 degrees, about an hour. Whisk flours in medium bowl.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Add honey, melted butter, and yeast to cooled grain mixture. Stir to combine. Place bowl on mixer stand and, using a dough hook, add flour and mix until dough forms a ball. Cover bowl and let dough rest 20 minutes. Add salt and knead on medium/low speed until dough clears the sides of the bowl, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add seeds and knead for another 15 seconds. Transfer to floured board and knead by hand until seeds are evenly dispersed and dough forms smooth ball. Place in greased bowl and let rise until double.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Adjust oven rack to middle position and pre-heat oven to 375. Spray two 9x5 loaf pans with cooking spray. Transfer dough to work surface and pat into a 12x9 rectangle. Cut in half length-wise, shape into loaves, spray with water, coat with oats and place in pans. Cover and let rise until doubled.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Bake until internal temperature reaches 200 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from pans and cool.</p>
