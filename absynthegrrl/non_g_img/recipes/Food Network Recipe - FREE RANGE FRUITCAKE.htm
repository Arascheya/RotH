<H3>FREE RANGE FRUITCAKE</H3>Recipe courtesy Alton Brown
<P><!-- dynamic ingredients list --><I>1 cup golden raisins <BR>1 cup currants 
<BR>1/2 cup sun dried cranberries <BR>1/2 cup sun dried blueberries <BR>1/2 cup 
sun dried cherries <BR>1/2 cup dried apricots, chopped <BR>Zest of one lemon, 
chopped coarsely <BR>Zest of one orange, chopped coarsely <BR>1/4 cup candied 
ginger, chopped <BR>1 cup gold rum <BR>1 cup sugar <BR>5 ounces unsalted butter 
(1 1/4 sticks) <BR>1 cup unfiltered apple juice <BR>4 whole cloves, ground <BR>6 
allspice berries, ground <BR>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon <BR>1 teaspoon ground 
ginger <BR><BR>1 3/4 cups all purpose flour <BR>1 1/2 teaspoons salt <BR>1 
teaspoon baking soda <BR>1 teaspoon baking powder <BR>2 eggs <BR>1/4 to 1/2 cup 
toasted pecans, broken <BR>Brandy for basting and/or spritzing</I>
<P>Combine dried fruits, candied ginger and both zests. Add rum and macerate 
overnight, or microwave for 5 minutes to re-hydrate fruit. 
<P>Place fruit and liquid in a non-reactive pot with the sugar, butter, apple 
juice and spices. Bring mixture to a boil stirring often, then reduce heat and 
simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool for at least 15 minutes. 
(Batter can be completed up to this point, then covered and refrigerated for up 
to 2 days. Bring to room temperature before completing cake.) 
<P>Heat oven to 325 degrees. 
<P>Combine dry ingredients and sift into fruit mixture. Quickly bring batter 
together with a large wooden spoon, then stir in eggs one at a time until 
completely integrated, then fold in nuts. Spoon into a 10-inch non-stick loaf 
pan and bake for 1 hour. Check for doneness by inserting toothpick into the 
middle of the cake. If it comes out clean, it's done. If not, bake another 10 
minutes, and check again. 
<P>Remove cake from oven and place on cooling rack or trivet. Baste or spritz 
top with brandy and allow to cool completely before turning out from pan. 
<P>When cake is completely cooled, seal in a tight sealing, food safe container. 
Every 2 to 3 days, feel the cake and if dry, spritz with brandy. The cake's 
flavor will enhance considerably over the next two weeks. If you decide to give 
the cake as a gift, be sure to tell the recipient that they are very lucky 
indeed.
