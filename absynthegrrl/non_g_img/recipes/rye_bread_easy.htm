<p class="pagecaption">Easy Rye Bread</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">2 packages active dry yeast (1 pkg = 2.25 teaspoons yeast)<br/>
1 cup warm water (105-115 degrees)<br/>
1/3 cup dark corn sysrup<br/>
4 1/2 to 5 1/2 cups dark rye flour (see Note below)<br/>
2 teaspoons salt</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Preparation:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">1. Note: For a lighter loaf, use 3 to 4 cups dark rye flour, 1/2 cup dark rye meal and 1 cup all-purpose flour.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">2. If you are uncertain about your yeast, proof it before starting. In a large warmed bowl or the warmed bowl of a stand mixer, dissolve yeast in water. Stir in corn syrup and set aside for 5 minutes or until yeast foams.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">3. Add 2 1/2 cups dark rye flour and beat with a spoon until smooth. Stir in salt. Cover and let rise about 30 minutes.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">4. Add 2 more cups flour, gradually, mixing after each addition. When dough becomes difficult to stir, knead by hand or by machine, adding up to 1 cup additional flour, if needed, until dough is stiff but slightly sticky. Form dough into a ball and place in a clean, dry, warmed bowl (do not coat with cooking spray). Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">5. Punch down dough and, with floured hands, form into a loaf. Place in a 9-inch-by-5-inch loaf pan that has been coated with cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour (it probably won't rise above the pan).</p>

<p class="regtxt9">6. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Bake 30-35 minutes or longer or until instant-read thermometer registers 190 degrees. If you've used all rye flour, the top won't brown much, so don't measure doneness by that. Turn out onto wire rack to cool completely.</p>
