<p class="pagecaption">Focaccia</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It's everywhere, taking over restaurant bread baskets, carving out its own niche at gourmet markets and transforming the upscale take-out sandwich. Focaccia, the rustic Italian flat bread that's crusty outside and chewy inside, has taken America by storm. The best news is that it's easy and fun to make at home. All you need is a willingness to dig your hands into the dough and the patience to let it rise. (If you have questions about baking bread, see the Q&A following the recipes.)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Fresh herbs, onions, olives, bacon and other aromatic ingredients add to the earthy character of focaccia, as the recipes here attest. The first one is a relatively simple focaccia made with onion, garlic, basil, thyme and rosemary mixed into the dough, which is then coated with olive oil and coarse salt. The three variations that are given use the same onion-herb dough as a base but feature different ingredients, which are kneaded in and applied on top. Each recipe makes a large sheet bread that can easily satisfy 8 to 10 people.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ingredients:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1 cup (packed) minced yellow onion</p>
<p class="regtxt9">2 medium garlic cloves, minced 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh basil</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme</p>
<p class="regtxt9">2 teaspoons minced fresh</p>
<p class="regtxt9">rosemary Freshly ground pepper 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water</p>
<p class="regtxt9">(105° to 115°) 1 cup lukewarm milk (105° to 115°)</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1 scant tablespoon table salt</p>
<p class="regtxt9">2 teaspoons plus a pinch of sugar</p>
<p class="regtxt9">One 1/4- ounce envelope active dry yeast</p>
<p class="regtxt9">About 6 1/2 cups bread flour</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Cornmeal, for dusting</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Coarse salt, for sprinkling</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1/4 cup ice water</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Directions:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1 . Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over moderate heat. Stir in the onion and garlic, reduce the heat to low and cook until softened and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the herbs and a generous amount of pepper and cook for I minute. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Stir in 1 cup of the water, then the milk, table salt and 2 teaspoons sugar (Photo I on page 56).</p>
<p class="regtxt9">2. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and the pinch of sugar in the remaining 1/2 cup lukewarm water until creamy and starting to bubble. Add to the onion mixture. Stir in the flour, 1 cup at a time (Photo 2), just until the dough becomes too stiff to stir. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface (Photo 3). With the help of a dough scraper, knead in only as much additional flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking (Photo 4). Knead the dough until smooth, supple and elastic, about 5 minutes (Photos 5 through 8).</p>
<p class="regtxt9">3. Generously grease a clean large bowl with olive oil. Transfer the dough to the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap (Photo 9) and a kitchen towel. If desired, label the bowl lo remind you when to punch down and shape the dough (Photo 10). Set aside in a warm draft-free spot until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">4. Punch down the dough. Re-cover the bowl and let the dough rise again until doubled, about 1 hour.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">5. Brush olive oil over the bottom and sides of a 17-by-13-by-l-inch black steel or heavy aluminum baking sheet. Sprinkle cornmeal on the pan, then tap out excess (Photo 11).</p>
<p class="regtxt9">6. Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a cornmeal-dusted work surface (Photo 12). Turn the dough over and over to coat lightly with cornmeal and shape into a rough rectangle. Lift the dough and place in the prepared pan. Gently pull, push and pat the dough so it fills the baking sheet (Photo 13). Let the dough rise uncovered in a draft-free spot until billowy, 45 minutes to I hour.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">7. Preheat the oven to 450° and position a rack in the bottom third. If using a baking stone or tiles, place on the rack and heat for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">8. Dip your fingers in flour and make many deep indentations in the dough. Brush lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with coarse salt.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">9. Place the baking sheet in the oven, toss the ice water on the oven floor and bake the focaccia for about 30 minutes, until the edges are crisp and a deep golden color. Using a long metal spatula, slide the focaccia onto a large rack to cool. To serve, cut into pieces with a serrated knife.</p>
