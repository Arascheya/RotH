Sift together:
    3-1/2 cups cake flour

Fold in 4 egg whites beaten stiff. Bake in 2 deep nine inch pans at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes. This makes a large cake and is one I use for my weddings because it cuts so smoothly.

Icing:

1-1/2 cups sugar disolved in 1-1/2 cups hot water

Bring sugar and water to boil and add cornstarch - stirring briskly until thick and clear. Add 3 egg yolks, one at a time, then juice and rind of one lemon, and one tblspn butter. Cool slightly and frost cake.
