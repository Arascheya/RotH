METHOD

Peel lemons with potato peeler (only the yellow/green peel). Place peels in a large glass jar and cover with one bottle of vodka. Leave in a cool place for 21 - 40 days.

Make syrup by mixing sugar and water over a medium heat. Keep stirring until sugar is melted, then cook syrup for 5 minutes. Cool down.

Strain lemon peel and add the liquid to the syrup together with second bottle of vodka. Mix well and bottle. Leave again for 40 days (if you can!!).

If the vodka is of a good quality, you can freeze the lemoncello.

Serve over crushed ice.
