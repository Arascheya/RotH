 5 Cups Prepared Blackberries
Prepared means washing, removing stems,
   trash, overripe and under ripe berries.
Crush enough to fill air spaces
7 Cups Sugar
1 Sure Jell Pectin
Above will make about 4 pints of jam
    

Measure sugar and keep ready.
Mix pectin with fruit, and bring to a boil using high heat.
At once add sugar.
Bring to a full boil (a boil that cannot be stirred down).
Boil hard for one minute. Remove from heat and skim for 5 minutes.
This helps prevent floating fruit.
Put quickly into jars leaving 1/4-inch headspace.
Clean rim and seal with rings.
Water bath in boiling water for 15 minutes for pints and quarts. We use a steam canner. Time is the same.
Remove and set on newspaper to cool.
It should set in 24 hours.
The next day remove rings and wash jars. Store with rings off.
You can remove the seeds by putting fruit through a fine wire sieve before cooking. We remove some but not all of the seeds. Your choice.
