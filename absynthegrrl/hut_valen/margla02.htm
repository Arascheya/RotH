<p class="regtxt5"><a href="HutRmDetails.htm">Hut Room Details</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">The walls are paneled in teak. The room is lit by a pool of warm light over an ornate oriental style rug in the center of the room. The rest of the floor is an intricate parquet of many different woods, some recognizable, some not. (Oak, Teak, Mahogany, Ebony, etc.) Above the rug is a one foot diameter dish of clear crystal with purple swirls dancing in it. On the wall opposite the entry door is a large, three foot by three foot, mirror.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When the players enter the Control Room they see a frozen tableau where Margla is pulling Soul Eater into her chest, dragging Valen's hands along with it. Valen has a frozen look of horror on her face, She Who Must Never Be Named is holding the tale of the demon as it is in flight.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen will move the functions of this room to the <a href="margla13.htm">Throne Room</a> once she is settled and then purge this room.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">On the large mirror is a blinking <a href="../common/HutMainScreen.txt">message</a> in Ancient Runes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="navsys.htm">NavSys database</a> - shows locations the Hut currently knows how to jump to. When the Hut jumps there is a prompt to save the current location with some type of tag. Hut base control percentage is 10% + Int  as a percentage.</p>
