<p class="pagecaption">Magic Theory</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Magic Types</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are two basic "technologies" of magic. The first is priestly or god-driven magic. This is the type of magic available to members of the various religious groups in the multi-verse. Spells vary depending on which diety is worshipped and the worshipper's status within the faith.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The second form is Arcane Majik - spelled differently to distinguish it from the diety sanctioned forms. Arcane Majik is studied and learned rather than granted. It is the more "scientific" form of approach and is based on the concept that majik is a reproducible reality that can be studied, designed, and improved upon. This is the form most likely to produce large scale effects for good or ill.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The religions view Arcane Majik as heresy and the practice of it is likely to bring excommunication, exile, or death in extreme cases. The two forms are not compatable. Once a person starts learning majik, god spells disappear.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Tesch Mar Hypothesis - Unified Universal Magic</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Magic is the use of naturally occurring energies to achieve a desired result. These energies are universal and well defined. Any form of magic inherently draws upon these energies regardless of the method used for gathering. The gathering methods are just different techniques taught to access the same energies. Some techniques are easier to master and thus are easier to teach and use.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Each spell is a pattern of energy control that produces a predictable and desired result. These patterns may be taught or learned by intense study and experimentation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Each spell consists of several distinct sections. The first section is the preparation of the user's awareness and concentration, allowing the user to visualize the energies used to create the desired pattern. The second section is the actual construction of the magical pattern for the spell and draws on the inherent psychic power of the user. The third section is the gathering and binding of external, supplemental energy required by the spell. This step often requires additional energies from the user to control the gathered energy. The final step is the targeting and release of the finished spell.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Margla's Corollary to Tesch Mar Hypothesis</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Majik and energy are similar things. Majik can be used and controlled like energy. Given suitable devices majik should be able to be interfaced to technological artifacts. Some type of energy resonant device must be the key to this effect.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Spell Basics</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Spells are taught as complete patterns to the neophyte, only as the user's skill and abilities grow is the user able to figure out how to change the amount of external energy required to vary the effect of the spell. Subtle changes in the pattern creation will allow changing the range or area of effect of the spell.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Majik identification is done by following the patterning of the spell(s) on the item in question. To be adept at this skill the identifier must have had exposure to a broad base of spells and pattern examples.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Items are created by first weaving a binding spell (enchant) into the material parts of the item. Once the item is assembled then the actual effect spell(s) are woven into the hooks left by the enchant base spell.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A 12th level spell, Encryption, allows the creator of an item to put a randomized pattern into the overall pattern of the item. This randomizer constantly changes so it is very difficult to unweave the majik on the item. Exhaustive research is required to attempt to dispel majik that has been encrypted this way. Usually this requires access to many spells and items created by the developer of the item to be dispelled. The caster of the encryption can unweave this pattern at any time.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Spiritual Magic - Theory and Concepts</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This form of magic is simpler in many ways. The dieties grant this magic to their followers. It is not necessary to understand the form or function of the spell, although as one progresses in the religious order a type of understanding evolves. It is this that allows the leaders of the religion to develop new spell concepts. Then through a regimen of prayer and interaction with the diety the new spell is created.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is a type of feedback loop between worshippers and their god. The worshippers donate personal power on holy and high holy days. This energy strengthens and feeds the diety making it possible for there to be more powerful magic available to the followers. If all worshippers disappear the god weakens, falls into a sleeping state, and eventually dies.</p>
