<p class="sectioncaption">26 - Valen Chambers</p>
<p class="regtxt5">CH, 10' flat in room A, 40' peaked ceiling in room B, 20 ' flat in rooms C-F: IL, see below.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="mHutRmDetails.htm">Hut Room Details</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">These chambers are dimly lit by small candles set upon tables, chairs, wall mountings, and elsewhere. Room B is rather spacious, and contains only a few articles of furniture (a workbench, several chairs, a writing table with chair, and several small bookshelves). Nothing appears to be of any value here, at first glance. The room is done in a gothic motif, ornate wrought iron candle holders, a large fireplace, and various gothic appearing hangings grace the walls. The aroma in this room is of scented candles.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The side chambers are screened by thick curtains. Room C is the sleeping chamber, D and E have equipment used when manufacturing magical items, and F contains a loom and assorted items for sewing and making woven items. Few magical devices will be found, most of them relatively minor in nature (a wand of magic missiles, for instance). Room E has a secret door in the ceiling.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In this room is a large canopy bed with dark red curtains embroidered with black roses. Near the bed is a teak night stand. In the bottom drawer of the night stand is the <a href="../gm_resources/items/HutWhistle.htm">skull whistle</a>.</p>
