<p class="sectioncaption">19 - Wine Cellars</p>
<p class="regtxt5">CH, 10' flat in rooms A-D; IL, none.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="mHutRmDetails.htm">Hut Room Details</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rooms A, B, C, and D each hold numerous kegs, barrels, and bottle-filled shelves containing the finest alcoholic beverages that twelve universes have to offer. Room A contains fine wines, B holds brands of vodka, C has assorted beers, meads, and ales, and room D is filled with exotic fruit drinks. Some of the drinks (20%) will infect the imbiber with dipsomania, as per the DMG, due to their quality and certain special enchantments.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Characters will soon discover that one can go continuously downstairs from room to room in this area, thanks to a peculiar warping of space that cannot be negated by magical or physical means. Hiding behind one of the wine barrels is Ivan, a giant mouse who can communicate telepathically with beings up to 10' away from him (like the ability of Vladimir the giant cat, from area 1). Ivan is one foot long (AC 6, MV 12", HD 1+1, HP 9, bites for 1-4 HP) and is very intelligent; he can learn and cast spells like a 4th-level magic-user. Ivan has chaotic good alignment, and a bad case of dipsomania; he will befriend anyone who offers him alcoholic drink, and (like Vladimir) he may be willing to offer limited information about the Hut.</p>
