<p class="pagecaption">Tesch Mar Theory on Gates</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are two forms of gates on the average world. These are the "Natural" gate and the "Hell" gate. Both come into being where the boundary between "Real Space" (an Ancient term for the Prime Material Plane) and the "Gate Dimension" are thin. Through my researches I intend to determine the usual number and placement strategy of these gates. I also plan to prove the connection between Hell gates and Natural gates. I believe the two are connected phenomenon.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Further I hope to prove these gates are actually linked to local magical nodes (called Earth Nodes in some papers) in some way. I plan to prove these gate nodes are actually super nodes in the earth node network. As such mathematical analysis indicates there should be seven super nodes for each local network in the Prime Material Plan. (mathematical modeling based on the Tesch Mar Hypothesis of Unified Universal Magic)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Natural gates may be used to travel between places in the Prime Material Plane. All that is required is the appropriate magic spells. These gates may be stabilized with powerful spells and held in one place, otherwise they tend to open, close, and drift randomly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hell gates open, close and drift similar to Natural gates but their stabilization requires sacrifices of sentient beings at each gate location.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Kaltereth addendum</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Minor power nodes link to major nodes and these link to "super" nodes. Tests have shown there can be no more than seven of these "super" nodes. Research at one of these "super" nodes demonstrated it also was a World Gate location. Using standard Gate detection methods around a major node revealed glimmers of the nearest Gate energy flowing into the node. Casting a majikal gate spell bounced the caster through the nearest World Gate location and then to the destination.</p>
