<p class="regtxt5">CH, each room (A-E) is domed, 15' high in center and 10' high along walls in rooms A-D, 25' hemisphere over E; IL, I CL centered in ceiling in each room.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="HutRmDetails.htm">Hut Room Details</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Each room in this area is devoted to a different form of game or hobby. Room A contains sewing materials and a small loom; B has assorted card and trinket games; C is a dressing room for dancers and actors, and D contains various musical instruments. Room E has a lowered floor in the center, 3' down, for dancers and actors to perform upon. The entertainers who perform here are usually ones who have been kidnapped by Margla, and they must please her with their performances in order to be released (poor performers are eaten).</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The curtains that separate each room are enchanted to deaden all sounds passing through them, effectively isolating the rooms during musical performances or dances. Several magical items collected from various planes and worlds may be found here, but when rooms A, B, and D are not in use, permanent illusions are cast over them, making them appear to be storage rooms with nothing valuable in them.</p>
