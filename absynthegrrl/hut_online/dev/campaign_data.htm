<p class="sectioncaption">Fully Online Version</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Note: Looting of "dead" PCs is not possible because they immediately respawn in their instance of the Hut. PCs are considered immortal for this game, although there could be healing times imposed to make "death" more debilitating.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Start in Miskaton, same as NWN, however, in this case each player has an instance of the Hut, disguised as a small suit of rooms in one of the slum sections of the city. Each instance links into the center of an old warehouse through a door that would normally lead to a small storage area. An outside observer would see an open central area with several levels of walkways with doors leading off. Behind each door is a Hut instance. Only authorized owners or crew could enter an instance.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In this version Valen already has become the Balance Keeper. She is recruiting others to help with the tasks through use of the Hut instances. She no longer is able to single handedly keep up with the tasks at hand and needs others as surrogates to help with stabilizing the Balance.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Starting package consider using <a href="../absynthegrrl/hut_online/marglaperim.htm">starting config</a>. Hut power system is damaged enough the the Hut cannot jump or alter layout. First repairs will bring internals back online, allowing mods. It should take a while before the Hut can be returned to a Jump capable status. These Hut instances do not contain a Cauldron or Cauldron Control.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">New players should find places where they can pick up small missions and get introduced to the various forces at play in the world. Need these to be less pointless than the StarWars/Everquest model, but a bit more defined than the Uru wander until you find something model. They can also overhear various conversations in taverns, inns, markets, etc. that will drop names and recent happenings to inquire about or check out.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Factions in Valley of Experiment: see also <a href="../absynthegrrl/gm_resources/powers_inx.htm">Powers and Alliances</a> for more information</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Aztol - return nobility to power and find the Ghost Wind crew, primarily Shandi and Krystal</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Kayara/Sharyl and the School of Arcanes arcane position, expansion of knowledge base</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Kara and River Wind crew - find their missing friends</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Merchanters - maintain power</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Nobility - regain power and status from Merchanters</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Piesthood - gain followers, reduce influence of Arcanes</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Arcanes - keep from losing power to the preisthood</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Sphinx clue - Elentaryn puzzle, available somewhere in Miskaton</p>
<p class="regtxt9">There are several political sections to the Valley as well</p>
<p class="regtxt12">The Shifters hold the upper west area and are fairly independent and low order</p>
<p class="regtxt12">need to refine/define the other sections and how they interact with each other as part of the trade and power situations</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Make sure to keep an open end to the adventures, however, allow for endings as well. For example, the players can confront Aztol, free Ishra, and change that part of the world. This ability to change the course of events needs to be apparent from even the small first adventures. Also remember, cannot be all things to all people and do any of it well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Also, remember, since the PCs can't die, the NPCs shouldn't be able to either. As an example: if Aztol is defeated, he is returned to a zero base of operation, however, he will begin rebuilding as soon as he can and could emerge in a mutated form later.</p>
