<p class="regtxt5">These notes pertain to the NWN/NWN2 scenario and to the broader, online, version</p>
<p class="regtxt5">These are the up to date, current, versions of these concepts - in cases where the data in the NWN/NWN2 folders disagrees with these versions, these versions are the final word.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">add to Hut Key - function to create additional Companion rings for non-Hut based modules</p>

<p class="regtxt5">add another set of Irena's weapons to consider giving to the Tiefling NPC</p>

<p class="regtxt9">in theory activating an item will trigger a script named the same as the tag for the item
for the Hut Key this would be: KeyofIrenaKatarya - for an example look at x2_it_sample</p>

<p class="regtxt9">modify this item to have tag of hutmasterkey - script uses conversation of hutkeyconvrs - create a simple one and test in a module after adding hutmasterkey.nss - use Uninvited Guests module - this is the toolset sample module - for dev testing</p>

<p class="regtxt12">OK - works if name the script i_hutmasterkey_ac - might have to split out the pieces into activity based calls</p>

<p class="regtxt12">setting a placeable active and attaching a conversation to it works - now try creating an active placeable at a target location with a script attached to simulate calling the Hut - make sure to name it uniquely so can use to find as exit target for the Hut interiors - test script is gazebotest, use 2nd guard shack - has nicest appearance for Hut entry</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">in Hut Based modules</p>

<p class="regtxt5">need to figure out why Irena wants a new generation of adventurers to find the Hut - what is her master plan?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">gathering adventurers to end the Dark Times</p>

<p class="regtxt9">adventurers to oppose Aztol and free Ishra</p>

<p class="regtxt5">how closely tied to Kayara and Sharyl is she?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">quite close</p>

<p class="regtxt12">she returned Shandi to them - even though Shandi resides in the Hut</p>

<p class="regtxt12">swiped the Level 7 library with them</p>

<p class="regtxt12">freed Tyana</p>

<p class="regtxt12">occasionally provides backup or transport to Kayara as Yara, the seer and others of her band of Wanderers</p>

<p class="regtxt5">do Kayara and Sharyl have an agenda of their own?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">want to get the word out about the world's past</p>

<p class="regtxt12">entails getting people to read the Cobra Books and visit some of the Ancient sites</p>

<p class="regtxt9">reduce tensions between Arcanes and Cults</p>

<p class="regtxt9">reduce power of Elentaryn and Aztol</p>

<p class="regtxt5">make sure the majority of romantic/flirtation interactions are gender neutral</p>

<p class="regtxt5">add relinkable door scripts to NWN2 and create a door blueprint to use it</p>

<p class="regtxt5">create a <a href="../musings.htm">Musings of the Hut Crew</a> book that can be found in the <a href="../margla27.htm">Library</a>. Maybe one the residents must find on their own, rather than the <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/koria_d.htm">Librarian</a> knowing of it.</p>
