<p class="regtxt5">Greetings traveler.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You are likely wondering where you are and how you got here. You have been carefully selected from the masses of the realms to undertake a role in the upheavals happening all around. I have selected you because you have shown intelligence, curiosity, and ability in your daily life. You have been brought here by means both magical and technological. I am sorry, however, the only way to return to your point of origin is by your own discovery of its location.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wish I had time to give you all the information you will need for this task, however, the knowledge would fill a library and take life times to impart. Such a library is one of the many rooms available to you inside this magical construct which will be your home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You should have found a key with this notebook. It will grant you access to everything within this construct. The key has many features to help you figure out its various functions and uses.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A librarian has agreed to stay in the Hut to assist you in finding other volumes that might be of assistance. Her name is Koria and I would take it as a great kindness if you treat her with respect. If you do not, she is under no obligation to remain and you will need to find items in the library for yourself, rather than being able to ask her for them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When you enter the library, ask Koria for the suggested first volumes. There are five of them, titled as follows: <a href="magic_theory.htm">Magical Theory</a>, <a href="gate_theory.htm">Gate Theory</a>, <a href="gods_theory.htm">Gods, Goddesses, and the rest</a>, <a href="hut_notes.htm">Hut Concepts</a>, and <a href="short_hist.htm">A Quick History of the World</a>. They are not nearly enough to tell you all that is happening, but they will give you a fighting chance at knowing what to ask. The realms are vast and we are but one among the multitudes. It is not possible to be all places at all times. The slice of the realms you experience will be different than the ones I have seen. Take heart that your contributions will always effect those around you and may change the very fabric of the realms you touch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This construct is large, comprising thirty-two rooms, although some are merely connecting items. But I digress. To save you a bit of confusion, there are two areas you should visit as soon as possible. The first is the library and you may reach it by descending the stairway to your courtyard and taking the first door on your right. The second is the throne room. This is the main control center for this construct. The recommended reading list will give you some idea about what this means. This room is accessed by descending the stairs to the first landing, entering your sitting chamber, and taking the door in the wall to your left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once again, I apologize for not being able to provide you with more assistance in this initial transition, however, events are unfolding far more quickly than I expected and I must rush to meet them. The last advice I can give is watch everything and pay attention to anything you hear. Sometimes the smallest statement carries the biggest impact. Good luck and be careful.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Moved the <a href="margladiary.htm">From Margla</a> section to its own Diary since this would be at the front of a diary system for the player.</p>
