<p class="pagecaption">Hut Starting Conditions - Option 1 - Not Used</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in"><a href="../hut_gm/margla29.htm">Start in Hall of Gateways</a></p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">Hut starts out in the woods near Mordentshire after Count Borusa causes the space/time rip during his experiments.</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">Count Borusa arrived in Mordentshire after his Tardis malfunctioned. He is trying to bind the energy of the land and occupants into the failed power cells of his Tardis. He is also working on creating new control crystals from bound souls.</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">Strahd wants to end the disturbances unbalancing his lands caused by Borusa. He will need to cantact the players while they are in Mordentshire.</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">Blend this so Strahd is more the "good guy" and Borusa is not. Use the concept of Gary Oldman style count for Strahd.</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">Threats to the village are more from the spacial instability and the desire to use soul energy to rebuild the Tardis. This anomaly will cause episodes of madness and other unpleasant effects in the townspeople.</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">Strahd will recognize one of the party as his long lost Elizabeta - could either pick a Ghost Wind crew member or Virginia Weathermay if want to allow Strahd to actually find a companion.</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">The apparatus is being used to compress souls into a condensed form to try and reach a critical mass to create a control matrix crystal. If it is destroyed then the souls will be released back into the bodies they came from. During the time the soul is imprisoned the body will function at minimal life support and operation. Intelligence is reduced to that of a moron and the victim requires a high level of care to remain healthy.</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">Borusa is a Time Lord. He has been driven mad by the space/time rip created during the Tardis crash. If he can be restored to sanity he will realize the evil of his previous experiments and can be persuaded to swap one of his remaining control crystals for a jump back to Galifrey. If he is killed instead, then his crystals can be appropriated with minimal fuss.</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">Inside the Hut Margla, the Lady of Pain, and the Consumer are locked in a Time-Stop initiated by Margla when she realized something was going wrong. This Time-Stop has extended to the Ghost Wind crew through the connection formed by Valen driving Soul Eater into Margla. To free Margla and the Lady of Pain the Consumer entity needs to be trapped in a spirit binding crystal placed in Soul Eater. Can get help from the librarian or maybe Shandi. Shandi is almost able to fight off the Time-Stop - if the party is in serious trouble she can actually free herself and come to the rescue. The crystal can be found in the Hill House in the lab.</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">Weathermay mansion - cross between Collinwood and as written.</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">On transfer - something goes wrong - a space/time pulse from Borusa's equipment - right at transition time. Margla issues a time-stop when she realizes the demon will get loose and infect either the hut or one of her daughters. The time-stop grabs the Ghost Wind crew, herself, the demon, and the Lady of Pain piece. When the players enter the Control Room they see a frozen tableau where Margla is pulling Soul Eater into her chest, dragging Valen's hands along with it. Valen has a frozen look of horror on her face, the Lady of Pain is holding the tale of the demon as it is in flight.</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">Margla is able to get a message to Katie - "Daughter, something has gone terribly wrong. You must find a way to imprison this demon or it will possess one of you. When you are ready the Hut Key can trigger the release of this time-stop."</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">at transfer - Thock and Heron experience visions of this realm. This gives them the ability to have some programming/computer skills come across.</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">Hut - legends of the hut exist in Ravenloft - it is a great power, it can move, etc. many of the powers seek it, feeling it could free them from the ravenloft realm. borusa comes across one of these legends in the libraries of the Weathermays. besides his experiements to create new control crystals and provide power to his ailing tardis he will try and follow up on legends of the Hut. remember - make Strahd the "good guy" in this scenario</p>
<p class="regtxt" style="text-indent:.5in">consider some spelljammer cross-over into the multi-planar aspects of planescape. also consider using the LegendOfSpelljammer to instead describe a bio-ship developed by either the Seed Team, or somethinglike them.</p>
