<p class="pagecaption">A Short History of the World</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">History of the Time Before</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When the World was young the Ancients walked the earth. We inherited this world from the. They traveled in strange and mysterious ways, in the air in Fiery Chariots, through the earth in Eggs of the Ancients, and through the seas in submersible shells.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The SunStar passed and the Ancients left taking Thoql with them and leaving only the unfertilized Eggs of Life reposing in the Primordial Womb. This is Naramahasan, the time of unfulfilled fertility, passion, and knowledge.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Yimara took pity and fertilized the Eggs of Life fulfilling the promise of fertility and passion. The Eggs of Life developed and grew to term. Thus the Ancients and the gods gave us life. Blessed are the Ancients, Thoql, and Yimara; age, knowledge, and passion, for from them springs life.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As Mahasan approached the Primordial Womb gave forth the Eggs of Life in which slumbered Man. At Mahasan the Eggs of Life gave birth to Man. Man was born in the labyrinthine bowels of the Earth. Thus began Khamen'a, the Trek of Life, the search for meaning and fulfillment. Man journeyed through the Underworld finally emerging into the Dawn of the World.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Man must journey far in his search for Nehaa - hra - Qemet, the mystic spirit world. He must journey through passion, thought, concentration, knowledge, and behold the Aryleton, the Core of Being. In gazing upon the Aryleton he will finally gain the holy truths and shall look upon Nehaa - hra - Qemet, for it dwells in the secret places within all of us.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When the SunStar passed the Ancients left for N - Dimensional Hyperspace to fight the demon Razaks. The Ancients now dwell within the infinity of N - Dimensions, clearing the Way to Mahasan for those condemned to the Outer Worlds. Our lives must be a constant preparation for joining the Ancients in the fight against Demons who seek to subjugate and destroy life.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When All have attained all knowledge of Nehaa - hra - Qemet then shall come again Thoql. He shall be known by his personal power, and he shall wear the Swirling Stone of Knowledge, the Scarab of Power, and the Centipede of Purpose. He shall master the Cavern of Eternal Concentration, the Veil of Cold Thought, and the Veil of Passion. He shall then ride the Fiery Chariot through N - Dimensional Hyperspace to rescue the Outer Worlds. Then shall the World be at Peace and dwell in Mahasan for all time.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">The Between Times</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Between the time of the passing of the Ancients and the beginning of the Hell Gate Wars, many beings immigrated through the World Gates to fill the once empty places. Empires rose and fell, evolved and devolved from this melange of outsiders. Added to this mix were the people who emerged from the Eggs of Life buried deep within the Man's Birth Caverns. As they emerged into the light of day the World Gates were sealed by some unknown Power. From that time forward only a few have managed to travel to or from this world by any magical means. Still, there have been cases. Margla Fleshfeaster, for a time, was headmistress of the Great School of Magic on a distant world. The Mistress of the Arcane School at Miskaton is said to have learned much of the art when she was off-world as well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The empires and cultures of the current world evolved from these beginnings. Here in the Valley of Experiment we were kept safe from many of these outside influences by the great barrier mountains around us. Few braved the perils of the Ancients Way or the fierce storms of the sea to venture to the distant lands. Yet we are not totally isolated. There is passage through the abandoned dwarven mines to the High valley, where religious fanatics rule a populace of god-magic given peoples. A short section of the Ancients Way leads to the Isle of Research, presided over by a mad mage and his army of mechanical creations. And some brave the sea and pirates to journey to the Sea Kingdoms, the Lotus Empire, and the Free Islands.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">History of the Hell Gate Wars</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Dark Times Forces arose around the world in the late teens of 6700. The main purpose being to open the seven Hellgates to allow the Princes of Hell through to this world. The Dark Times Forces here on this world are lead by a being known as the Black Hand or just The Hand.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Hand's major holding is at the Hellgate that was not sealed during the Hellgate Wars. To seal this Hellgate a special set of artifacts have to be found and the Chosen One needs to be found to use them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Late in 6717 there were groups of adventurers looking for ways to stop the Dark Times Forces. They found clues to the finding of these artifacts but determined that the Dark Times Forces were amassing too much strength and would probably have the Hellgates open before anyone could find the artifacts. So they organized the Hellgate Wars. While the armies were attacking the fortifications around the outside of the Hellgates, groups of these adventurers gated into the main Hellgate chambers, destroyed the temples to the Demon Princes, and sealed the Hellgates. This was done so the Hand and the Dark Times Forces would be so disorganized that other adventurers could go and seek the artifacts needed to completely defeat the Dark Times.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It is impossible to kill the Hand without some information contained in a Gold Dragon Hide bound book, whereabouts unknown.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As far as anyone knows no one is searching for the magical artifacts needed to permanently seal the Hellgates. Nor has anyone seemed inclined to figure out where the Gold Dragon Hide book is.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Current Times</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The current time is 40 years after the Hell Gate Wars. The Dark Forces are stirring in the far corners, hidden in the shadows. Old alliances are breaking, new ones are forming, and a storm of chaos once again threatens the world.</p>
