<p class="pagecaption">Grand Library - CH, 15' flat in each room; IL, each room has 5 CL's, one in center and one in each corner.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="HutRmDetails.htm">Hut Room Details</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">The library resembles the layout used in Name of the Rose. Each book chamber is 10x10 with four ways out. Four link to the rest of the Hut. Otherwise there are stairways linking to platforms around the chambers and to other chambers. At startup there are only a few stairways that attach to the rooms that access the rest of the Hut. As additional information is released more stairways will link new rooms in with additional data for the Players. The spell books of ancient mages lie here beside texts discussing the nature of magic and the universe, and volumes covering hundreds of other topics. Books are distributed in what looks like random order. In fact the order makes perfect sense to the Librarian.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At startup there are five rooms open in the configuration shown in the diagram. Frome the stairways between these rooms the players can see the additional areas that they can't yet get to.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">On one shelf in chamber E there are two books that appear solid. One is labelled <a href="akhalt.htm">Akhalt</a> and the other is labelled <a href="starstones.htm">Star Stones</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">All other books on the shelves in the various chambers appear greyish and almost transparent. These are volumes that have not yet been released. Releasing new data will be a combination of opening new rooms and un-greying various volumes in existing rooms. In all cases the Librarian will be able to point to the relevant material if the Players ask her about something. Otherwise the Players may wander around and see what has appeared.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../gm_resources/npcs/koria_d.htm">Koria</a> serves as librarian here. Margla attempted to free her from her contract before the final jump but she refused to leave. Valen also offered her the chance to leave, however, she refused again. She is devoted to the library and the books. She will respect and assist any who show the same concern and respect for the library as she does.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Near each door is a magical niche where books may be placed. Any book placed within is automatically re-shelved.</p>
