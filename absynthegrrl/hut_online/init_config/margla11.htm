<p class="regtxt5">The walls of the "cellar" are made from packed earth, but very little can be flaked off or dug away; like all other walls in the Hut, these are immune to spells like dig or disintegrate.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The musty "cellar" serves as a dumping ground for items newly brought in from one of Margla's trips around the land, as well as a sort of trash bin for unwanted nonmagical refuse. Few things found here will have any real worth, though some may prove interesting as curios.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A single torch burns on the wall near the interior door leading to room B. Room A is filled with skulls and bones of adventurers who fell victim to the Hut or its guardians - perhaps seventy creatures of various races are represented. Burried in the refuse is a <a href="../gm_resources/items/HutPowerLinker.htm">Power Linking Crystal</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Room B is empty.</p>
