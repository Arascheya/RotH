        <p> There had been numerous proposals for a tunnel under the channel throughout 
          the 19th Century including one by Napoleon, but the first serious attempt 
          to build a tunnel came with an Act of Parliament in 1875 authorising 
          the Channel Tunnel Company Ltd. to start preliminary trials. This was 
          an Anglo French project with a simultaneous Act of Parliament in France. 
          By 1877 several shafts had been sunk to a depth of 330 feet at Sangatte 
          in France but initial work carried out at St. Margaret's Bay, to the 
          east of Dover had to be abandoned due to flooding. In 1880 under the 
          direction of Sir Edward Watkin, Chairman of the South Eastern Railway, 
          a new shaft (No. 1 shaft) was sunk at Abbot's Cliff, between Dover and 
          Folkestone with a horizontal gallery being driven along the cliff, 10 
          feet above the high water mark. This seven foot diameter pilot tunnel 
          was eventually to be enlarged to standard gauge with a connection to 
          the South Eastern Railway. </p>

        <p> After Welsh miners had bored 800 feet of tunnel a second shaft (No 
          2) was sunk at Shakespeare Cliff in February 1881. This tunnel was started 
          under the foreshore heading towards a mid channel meeting with the French 
          pilot tunnel.</p>
        <p>Both tunnels were to have been bored using a compressed air boring 
          machine invented and built by Colonel Fredrick Beaumont MP. Beaumont 
          had been involved with the Channel Tunnel Company since 1874 and had 
          successfully bored a number of tunnels without the use of explosives 
          and 3 ½ times faster than manual labour. It was not however Beaumont's 
          boring machine that was used. Captain Thomas English of Dartford, Kent 
          patented a far superior rotary boring machine in 1880 capable of cutting 
          nearly half a mile a month and it was this not Beaumont's machine that 
          was used on this first attempt at tunnelling under the channel. The 
          tunnel was credited to Beaumont in 'The Engineer' magazine and despite 
          letters of protest from English the editor refused to correct the mistake 
          and Beaumont did nothing to clarify the situation. Even to this day 
          this early Channel Tunnel trial is often credited to the Beaumont machine.<br>

        <p> The Channel Tunnel Company expected the pilot tunnel to be completed 
          by 1886. Sir Edward Watkin applied to the government for public funds 
          to complete the 11 mile section to meet the French mid channel. These 
          funds were not forthcoming so Sir Edward formed a new company, The Submarine 
          Continental Railway Company that took over the shafts and headings from 
          the South Eastern Railway in 1882. The company prepared a new Bill to 
          put before Parliament but by now the government were getting worried 
          about the military implications of a link to Europe and a new military 
          commission heard evidence from Lieutenant General Sir Garnet Wolseley 
          that the tunnel might be "calamitous for England", he added 
          that "No matter what fortifications and defences were built, there 
          would always be the peril of some continental army seizing the tunnel 
          exit by surprise." Despite assurances from Sir Edward that the 
          defence against invasion was adequate by flooding the tunnel, cutting 
          of the ventilation and forcing smoke into the tunnel and cutting the 
          cables on the lifts in the shaft thereby trapping any invader at the 
          bottom, the commission was not convinced.</p>

          Political instability in France didn't help the situation and the Anglo/French 
          Tunnel Treaty which five years earlier had been warmly received was 
          now looked on with opposition by the government and public at large 
          who still had a lingering fear of their old advisory across the Channel. 
          To counteract this fear Sir Edward conducted a series of visits to the 
          tunnel inviting prominent businessmen including the Lord Mayor of London, 
          the visit culminated in luncheon in a chamber cut into the side of the 
          heading. Many such visits followed and an account of one of them in 
          the Illustrated London News on 4th March 1882 was most revealing "The 
          Channel Tunnel was again opened to another party of London visitors 
          on Tuesday of last week. Under the guidance of Mr. Frances Brady, CE, 
          engineer of the Channel Tunnel, and Col. Beaumont, RE, the visitors, 
          six at a time, having put on rough overalls to save their clothes from 
          dust, descended into the shaft by means of an iron cage, such as is 
          used in coal mines. </p>

              at the foot of the Shakespeare Cliff, between Folkestone and Dover, 
              and is about one hundred and sixty feet in depth. The opening is 
              circular, with boarded sides, and the descending apparatus is worked 
              by a steam engine. At the bottom is a square chamber dug in the 
              chalk, the sides of which are protected by heavy beams; and in front 
              is the experimental boring, a low roofed circular tunnel, about 
              seven feet in diameter, the floor of which is laid with a double 
              line of tram rails.</td>

        <p> This tunnel is admirably ventilated, and on visiting days is lighted 
          with electric lamps, the steam power at the mouth of the shaft being 
          sufficient for all purposes. The stratum through which the experimental 
          borings have been made is the lower grey chalk. This material, while 
          perfectly dry, and very easily worked, is sufficiently hard to dispel 
          any apprehensions of crumbling or falling in.</p>
        <p>The length of the Submarine Continental Railway Company's Tunnel, under 
          the sea, from the English to the French shore, will be twenty-two miles; 
          and, taking the shore approaches at four miles on each side, there will 
          be a total length of thirty miles of tunneling. The shaft goes down 
          to the beginning of the tunnel, which is here 100 feet below the surface 
          of the sea. A heading, now three quarters of a mile long, has been driven 
          in the direction of the head of the Admiralty Pier [Dover], entirely 
          in the grey chalk, near its base, and a few feet above the impermeable 
          strata formed by the gault clay</p>
