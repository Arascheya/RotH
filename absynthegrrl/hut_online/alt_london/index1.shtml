        <p> The present heading is 7 feet in diameter. Machinery is being constructed 
          by which this 7 feet hole can be enlarged to 14 feet by cutting an annular 
          space, 3 feet 6 inches wide, around it. This will be done by machinery 
          furnished with an upper bore head. One machine will follow the other, 
          at a proper interval; and the debris from the cutting by the first will 
          be passed out trough the second machine, The compressed air, likewise, 
          which is necessary to work the advanced machine, will be similarly passed 
          through the machine coming behind; only two men are at present needed 
          for each machine.</p>

        <p> At the end of the tunnel the visitors found one of the Beaumont compressed 
          air boring machines at work. The length of this machine from the borer 
          to the tail end is about 33 feet. Its work is done by the cutting action 
          of short steel cutters fixed in two revolving arms, seven cutters in 
          each, the upper portion of the frame in which the borer is fixed moving 
          forward 5/16ths of an inch with every complete revolution of the cutters, 
          In this way a thin paring from the whole face of the chalk is cut away 
          with every turn of the borer, A man in front shovels the crumbled debris 
          into small buckets, which, traveling on an endless band, shoot the dirt 
          into a skip tended by another man. The skip when filled is run along 
          a tramway to the mouth of the shaft. At present these trolleys, each 
          holding about one third of a cubic yard, are drawn by men; but before 
          long it is hoped that small compressed air engines will be used for 
          traction. The rate of progress is about one hundred yards per week, 
          but will soon be much accelerated. As worked at present, the number 
          of revolutions it makes is two or three per minute, which amounts to 
          bring nearly an inch a minute while the machine is at work. But Colonel 
          Beaumont anticipates no difficulty in making the machine cut its way 
          at the rate of 3/8ths of an inch per revolution, and getting five revolutions 
          per minute, which would give a rate of advance of two inches per minute&#8230;</p>
        <p>The boring has now advanced to the length of 1,250 yards and it is 
          going on at the rate of three miles a year, which speed of working, 
          as we said, will be increased. Simultaneous borings from the French 
          side at the same rate would give six miles a year, or a complete tunnel 
          underneath and across the Channel in three years and a half.</p>
        <p>The shape which the completed tunnel will assume will probably be a 
          circle, 14 feet in diameter, but flattened at the bottom to receive 
          the rails. It will be lined with two feet thickness of cement concrete; 
          not that this is necessary to ensure the stability of the work, but 
          to prevent accidental falls of chalk. The concrete will be made of shingle 
          from Dungeness, and of cement formed from the grey chalk excavated from 
          the tunnel itself. In this manner, the tunnel will afford the means 
          of its own lining at a cheap rate. The gradients will be 1 in 80, on 
          each side, until the depth of 150 feet below the bottom of the sea is 
          reached; after which the line may be said to be level, subject only 
          to a very slight inclination from the centre outwards, to prevent the 
          lodgings of water.<br>

        <p> <br>
          The ventilation of the tunnel is, perhaps, the simplest matter in connection 
          with it, but as some doubts have been expressed upon this, it may be 
          here shortly explained. During the construction of the tunnel, the air 
          necessary for ventilation will be more than enough supplied by that 
          used to drive the boring machines. When the tunnel is opened for traffic, 
          the trains will run through by means of Beaumont compressed-air locomotives.</p>
        <p>The Channel Tunnel locomotive will weigh from sixty to seventy tons, 
          and will be charged with 1,200 cubic feet of air, compressed to the 
          density of seventy atmospheres, the equivalent of which is over 80,000 
          cubic feet of free air. This will give power sufficient to draw a train 
          of 250 tons gross weight (including the engine) the distance of twenty-two 
          miles under the sea, Assuming that the rate of traveling be thirty miles 
          an hour, the air discharged by the engine would give a supply of free 
          and pure air to the amount of 2,000 cubic feet, approximately, which 
          will be far in excess of what is needed by the passengers in the train. 
          Reservoirs will be placed at convenient intervals, so that the engines, 
          should they need it, may be replenished with compressed air. It will, 
          therefore, be seen that Colonel Beaumont's system of compressed-air 
          engines affords equal advantages with the ordinary steam locomotives, 
          and with no increase in weight."</p>
        <p>Later visitors to the tunnel included the prime minister and Mrs. Gladstone, 
          the Prince of Wales and the Archbishop of Canterbury but the Military 
          Committee were not convinced and two Bills submitted to Parliament did 
          not receive their recommendation.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to put a stop to the tunnel the Board of Trade invoked 
          Section 77 of the South Eastern Railway Act of 1881 which forbade tunneling 
          beyond the low water mark without specific authority and demanded the 
          boring should stop; after protesting the company agreed to suspend the 
          operation. Watkin informed the Board of Trade that by turning off the 
          machine, which was also responsible for the ventilation in the tunnel, 
          it would be putting the lives of the workforce at risk. The Board of 
          Trade relented and tunneling continued pending an inspection by the 
          Boards officials.<br>
        </p>

        <p> Watkin put various obstacles in the way of this inspection and eventually 
          the Board of Trade applied for a High Court order giving them access 
          to the Shakespeare Cliff heading; following this the tunneling stopped. 
          Following the inspection the Board recommended that the work should 
          cease but Watkin again ignored this request and continued boring the 
          tunnel whenever there were no visitors.</p>
        <p>By the end of 1882 the Abbot's Cliff heading had reached 897 yards 
          and that at Shakespeare Cliff was 2,040 yards in length. The Board of 
          Trade paid a further visit and reported that a further 70 yards had 
          been bored in breach of the injunction as a result the Board took out 
          further court proceedings against the company despite the fact that 
          they later admitted their calculations were wrong.</p>
        <p>In the following years numerous Bills were put before Parliament both 
          by the South Eastern Railway, the Submarine Continental Railway and 
          other tunneling rivals but all were thrown out and this valiant first 
          attempt at building a Channel was dealt its final fatal blow in 1898 
          when the South Eastern Railway and The Channel Tunnel Co. Ltd (which 
          had by this time merged with Submarine Continental Railway Co) were 
          permanently restrained from any further boring beneath the sea bed by 
          the Chancery Division of the High Court. </p>
        <p>Both shafts were infilled and the No. 2 heading lay forgotten until 
          1974 when another tunnel was proposed and work restarted at the Shakespeare 
          Cliff site. As the 1882 tunnel was likely to be bisected by the new 
          bore, the original No. 2 shaft was excavated and the tunnel dewatered 
          to remove any iron lining that may have got in the way of the new boring 
          machine. The shaft was found to be unlined down to solid rock and a 
          circular steel ribbed and timber lining was installed. At the shaft 
          bottom the access tunnel was found to be intact although some of the 
          timber supports had fractured due to pressure and there were numerous 
          chalk falls. The timber was replaced at shaft bottom, a new sump was 
          constructed and the area generally made safe. 40 metres from the shaft, 
          the circular bore of the 1882 tunnel was located. Having pumped out 
          the first section of tunnel the condition was found to be poor with 
          numerous collapses and broken ring linings. The falls were cleared, 
          some linings repaired and new colliery type arches installed. Away from 
          the cliff line the condition of the old tunnel improved although there 
          were some falls to roof level leaving voids above that could be climbed 
          through, these were cleared. A concrete bulkhead was installed at 810 
          metres and no attempt was made to reach the tunneling machine in the 
          unsupported section of the tunnel beyond. With the abandonment of this 
          channel tunnel scheme the shaft was backfilled but the 1882 tunnel was 
          uncovered again in 1988 when it was bisected by the machine boring the 
          present Channel Tunnel. </p>
        <p>Access to the No.1 heading at Abbot's Cliff has been maintained. It 
          has been intersected by one of a number of drainage adits driven from 
          the base of the cliff under the main railway line. Until the late 1990's 
          this adit was readily accessible but the portals of each adit have now 
          been rebuilt and are secured by locked doors. The Channel Tunnel workings 
          are accessed through Adit No 20 (Access is now controlled by Railtrack) 
          where a timber lined square section tunnel (concrete lined where is 
          passes under the railway line) meets the 1880 tunnel after 70 metres. 
          At the junction, there is a short stub timber lined passage to the left; 
          the original shaft would have been here with the boring machine assembled 
          close to the shaft bottom. The bored tunnel is to the right and initially 
          is in good condition with wooden boards on the floor. After 78 metres 
          there is an inscription on the wall left by William Sharp, possibly 
          one of the Welsh miners who bored the tunnel. Unfortunately Mr. Sharp 
          made a spelling error, which he clumsily corrected and left, for posterity. 
          The inscription reads 'This tunnel was begubnugn in 1880 William Sharp'.</p>
        <p>Beyond the point the tunnel begins to dip downwards, there are a number 
          of chalk falls and the water gets deeper. There is some timber propping 
          on the right hand side. At 180 metres there is a large chalk fall, which 
          can be reached although the water is 3 feet deep at this point. Beyond 
          here the water quickly comes up to roof level and <br>
          no further exploration is possible.<br>
