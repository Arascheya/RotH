He is in his teens during this time frame and could be encountered running errands for his mother or working odd jobs. Make sure he is involved if Fu becomes entangled. - Nayland Smith is contemporary of Rhomer - they are of the same age, Smith encounters Fu early in life during this time and thus begins his life-long quest to foil his plans. Petrie is slightly older and aquainted with Drs Watson and Seward. (first Fu stories appear circa 1913)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Henry Irving (b. 1838) - Born John Henry Brodribb, Henry Irving has been one of the best-loved actors and directors on Gothic Earth almost since the day he first appeared on stage in 1856. Originally from Somerset, he was educated for a career in business and spent some time as a London clerk before beginning to tour with a small theater group. In 187 1, he played the role of Mathian in Lewis’s 7he Bells at London’s Lyceum Theatre, earning critical acclaim and renown. In 1878, he took over the management of the Lyceum and ushered in a new age for London theater. Among his most respected performances were Hamlet (1874), Shylock (1878), Twelfth Night ( 1884), Tennyson’s The Cup ( 188 1 ) and Becket ( 1893), and Cymbeline ( 1896). He was knighted in 1895, becoming the first actor so honored.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In addition to his acting and directing success, Irving contributed many innovations to theatrical art, including the increased use of stage lighting and the darkening of the theater during performances.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Oddly, Irving’s performance in the lead role of Macbeth in 1889 was not well received, and he seems to be having difficulty recovering from that outing. Perhaps his career will soon draw to a close. Even if that is the case, he can certainly look back on a productive and brilliant career.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first door appeared shortly after Borusa arrived through a faulty gate. This triggered the formation of the Doors, (<a href="../gm_resources/info/gateinfo.htm">World Gates</a>). The leader of the <a href="../gm_resources/info/doorkeepers.htm">Keepers of the Doors</a> was the first to see it and to step through. A great deal of luck allowed him to step back through before dieing in Sigil. Now he and his followers check out any Door reports or rumors. They have a log of Doors and their locations. This information can be had for a fee. No Door Keeper will willingly go through one of these Doors after hearing what the founder experienced.</p>

</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jack Seward knows Jekyll and Watson from his connections in the medical circles. He ends up introducing Lucy and Borusa. Borusa seeks to mary Lucy and gain access to her resources, not so much wealth, that he got from Jekyll, but political influence and access to resource bases. Dr. Petrie is also in this group. Petrie lives somewhere near Rectory Grove - south and a bit east of Battersea - probably just south of the 1859 map - mostly south of column 14 - place him on <a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?grid2map?X=528750&Y=174750&zoom=1">Manchuria Rd</a>. to the south-west of Clapham Common - see the contemporary London map south of Battersea.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Seward will mention at some point how two of his good friends have changed lately. Henry Jekyll doesn't seem quite himself - after a bout of reclusiveness he was briefly more social, then became a recluse once more. Now he just doesn't seem to be the Henry Jekyll Seward used to know. Then there is the strange case of James Petrie who of late has become nervous and aprehensive. He seems to start at shadows and yet be seeking something in them. Jekyll used to not be that interested in women, now he is one of those persuing Luci Wellingham, even though it had seemed like she was going to marry Arthur Holmwood. Hut occupants can over-hear a conversation between Seward and Quincy Morris about this. They will also mention Mina and her Count, expressing distaste over her being seen with him while Harker is off "god knows where".</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hut is in the outer sections of the Wellingham Estate. Luci Wellingham is a friend of Mina and Jonathan. The family finds the whole military thing tedious, however it is easier to go along rather than fight it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lucy's family has ties to the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, the owners and operators of the Orient Express, and Borusa is hoping to get an in with them. This company is financing the tunnel and employs some of the brightest techs available. CIWL has also built enough tunnels to link all the railroads leading into London. (remember to add this to the London map when converting it)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fu and the Si Fan are working for terrestrial power and to find one of the Doors the Door Keepers watch. He will also be made aware of the Hut through one of his spies in the Wellingham household. So far Lord Willem has managed not to let anything slip in front of the spy about his connection to the Door Keepers.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Babbage Engine used for <a href="../gm_resources/info/chunnel.htm">Channel Tunnel</a> (<a href="../common/place_images/chunnelmap.pdf">map</a>) calculations is currently being kept at the Wagon Lit offices in downtown London. Fu also would like to get one of the design engineers of this into his research group. Lord Willem's father funded Babbage when the government backed out. The prototype was built in 1865 and worked poorly, mostly from the inability to create the proper precision in the parts. Lord Willem and a couple of friends were experimenting with an old tome they found in the Wellingham library and opened the first Door. Through a bit of luck they were befriended by an <a href="../gm_resources/npcs/engineer_v.htm">engineer</a> in Sigil who wanted to escape from the Cage and return to Real Space. This engineer was able to create the machines necessary for the creation of precision parts used in Babbage Engines. He is in his sixties now, but is still the chief engineer at International Calculating Machines, a wholy owned subsidiary of Wagon Lit.Wellingham is the leader of the Door Keepers. Their symbol is an infinity symbol with a sphere at the crossing point.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tunnel construction material is from another place, reached through the Doors. Willem brought it back a few years ago. Seward might remember his being gone at that time. This material should be some sort of spun material, something that can be flexible, water-proof, and tough.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Key will transfer to Valen for this scenario - mostly to keep the complexity down. She will collapse for several minutes as she comes to grips with the barrage of data from the Hut systems. She will begin to take more control after this, especially when assigning tasks to her own crew. Before venturing out again she will sew small dagger sheaths into sleeves of her top and fit a carrying pouch into a purse for Soul Eater.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen has accidentally approached the council and they think she is the <a href="../gm_resources/npcs/slayer.htm">Slayer</a>, arrived early. She is thinking of actually undertaking the task the council wants the Slayer to do. This task is to eliminate a nest of 20 <a href="../gm_resources/char_type_info/vampyr.htm">vampyr</a> in Whitechapel the area. When they visit Prince Sergei remember he and Princess Maria know and respect each other.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Holmes will have Dr. Watson with him the next time the players visit. Watson can be asked about Dr. Seward and may mention van Helsing coming ahead to look at Lucy Wellingham. Holmes will mention <a href="../gm_resources/npcs/slayer.htm">Princess Maria</a> and her father King Carol I coming on state visit. They are expected to arrive two days from present. Part of the state visit is for King Carol to persuade Lord Wellingham to base some of CIWL's continental activities in Roumania, particularly the Eastern Europian and Russin arms of CIWL's transport support. He is also calling on Queen Victoria as required by state protocols. He knows his daughter is the Slayer and will be extremely upset if something happens to her while she is on duty.Van Helsing is the royal family doctor and <a href="../gm_resources/info/watchers.htm">Princess Maria's Watcher.</a></p>
