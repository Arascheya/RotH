<p class="sectioncaption">13 - Throne Room</p>
<p class="regtxt5">CH, vaulted ceiling 60' high along long axis, down to 20' high at sides, supported by pillars; IL, none except for I CL (red) over throne, 30' above floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="HutRmDetails.htm">Hut Room Details</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Grand Throne room is an awe-inspiring structure, with floors and walls composed of black marble with veins of pale gold light. The pillars lining the room are clear purple glassteel. Through the ceiling a swirling spiral galaxy floats in a black sky.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the head of the room is a raised dais 2' high, upon which four titanic human skulls, each 10' across, rest facing the opposite end of the hall. The skulls are made from carefully fitted sections of ivory, rendered hard as steel through enchantments. Centered between the skulls is the great throne of Margla, rising an additional 3' above the dais.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The throne is composed of fossilized dragon bones. The seat and back are parts of the spine, pelvis and rib cage, the canopy over the seat is the skull, and various other bones form the arm rests and structure of the chair. The chair is the perfect chair for the Hut Controller, cradling them in a warm and comfortable embrace. To all others it is cold and forboding. This chair grants the Hut Controller True-Sight and Detect Lie while seated in it. It will also allow the casting of Flames of Doom and Morgan's Red Death using power from the Hut instead of from the Controller. The throne will allow the Controller to teleport to it from any location in the Hut and teleport from it to any other location in the Hut.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Valen will move the functions of the <a href="margla02.htm">Control Room</a> to this room and then remove the <a href="margla02.htm">Control Room</a> from the Hut. The thought crystal interface is moved to the dragon skull over the throne. The dias is expanded with smaller chairs arrayed near the throne for the rest of the normal Hut occupants. The display screen of the control room is now a series holo-projections in the air near the throne and other chairs. The Controller can call up any view(s) desired on these screens, including Hut status, programs, debug, etc.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When first seated in the throne a glowing screen appears, hovering in front of the throne, with a blinking <a href="HutMainScreen.txt">message</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the mster instance there is a gate behind the throne that links directly to the throne room of the <a href="tac_team.htm">Tac Team</a> Hut instance. This allows direct access between the master and this instance for debriefings and mission planning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Also visible is a button labelled <a href="navsys.htm">NavSys database</a>. This shows locations the Hut currently knows how to jump to. When the Hut jumps there is a prompt to save the current location with some type of tag.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider - add to throne room - for story - consider for gaming - a jeweld orb floats inside a clear crystal gem. this orb is a detailed map of the world the Hut currently resides on. with appropriate concentration the Controller can use it to get prelim visuals for navigation. these visuals can be used at a -5% penalty for nav, otherwise they can be used to plot a course for the cauldron so on-site visuals can be gotten */</p>
