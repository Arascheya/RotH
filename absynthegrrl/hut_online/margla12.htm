<p class="regtxt5">The attic looks very much like what one would expect to see, except that no chimney rises through it from the stove, and the ceiling isn't pointed like the roof of the Hut. Instead it looks like the attic of a fancy victorian house, all weird angles, odd nooks, and small hidden places behind trunks, boxes, etc. Scattered about the floor of the attic are trunks, chests, and boxes full of old clothing, used-up wands and burnt-out amulets, and the other useless paraphernalia that an ancient witch might accumulate. There are also misc tools and implements here. For instance maybe a shovel or two, rakes, trowels, and various other items that have no place here, but got dumped anyway in the odd corner or nook. A rusty sword and a ratty set of cloth armor can also be found scattered among the junk.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">One of the trunks contains 20-80 gems, 20-50 jewels, and a pouch of 4 <a href="../gm_resources/items/HutSummonGem.htm">Summoning Gems</a>. Beneath this treasure is a silk cloth covering up a symbol of insanity inscribed on the trunk's bottom. A second trunk contains a <a href="../gm_resources/items/HutPowerLinker.htm">Power Sharing Crystal</a> hidden in a false bottom.</p>
