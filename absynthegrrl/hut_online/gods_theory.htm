<p class="pagecaption">Theory of Gods, Goddesses, and the Cosmic All</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This first section is a quick explanation of the various powers in the fabric of the multiverse. There are three main levels with the Old Ones being the highest, oldest and most powerful. Next are the three Younger Ones, the Greater Powers, and last are the Lesser Powers, the Proxy Pack as Irena often calls them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are two Old Ones. These are the Creator and the Destructor and in the beginning of this version of the multiverse they were the driving forces. At first they were in balance with each other, but then they began to try and dominate each other, trying to create more than was ended, trying to end more than was created. To achieve these goals each Old One created a servitor, the original two of the Younger Ones, the Greater Powers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a time the two Greater Powers went along with the wishes of the Old One that had made them. As they watched and interacted with each other they began to see the craziness in the things the Old Ones were doing. They banded together and discussed the insanity that was falling upon their creators and they each split a part of themselves off and formed a third Greater Power, the Balance Keeper, to provide an impartial viewpoint to the tasks they were assigned. In time they came to understand the Creator and Destructor were on their way to destroying the multiverse, without thought or concern for the rich beauty of the creation itself. They took action and imprisoned the Old Ones, sealing the places with great magics and hiding the required keys in distant and unknown places. Once this was complete they settled into their current tasks and let the multiverse evolve.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The three Greater Powers are She Who Must Never Be Named, The Null, and the Balance Keeper. She Who Must Never Be Named resides in the City at the Center. She... is the avatar of order, form, and revealed knowledge. The Null embodies the unknown, the formless, the potentials unrealized as yet in the multiverse. The Balance Keeper maintains the balance between any extremes and provides perspective to the other two. She will destroy if there is too much creation, create if there is too much destruction, give law when there is too much chaos, create chaos when there is too much order.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Lesser Powers, the Proxy Pack, are the gods and goddess most beings worship. Everyone has a different theory about where these came from, but there are several common points. The Lesser Powers can be created and destroyed by each other, by the Greater Powers, and by mortals if they have the necessary tools. They tend to be jealous and petty and fight among themselves all the time. They also inflame their followers into fighting among themselves.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">More Notes</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I realize this is very condensed and contains some concepts that may not be understood. The descriptions below should help a bit with some of the confusion.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Multiverse, Realms, and Worlds</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Multiverse is the entirety of this cycle of creation and form. It encompasses all worlds, time-lines, and Powers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A World is a set of similar places in multiple timelines that have a similar basic set of races, circumstances, and Lesser Powers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A Realm is a single instance of a World. Each being is from a Realm, although there may be echoes of each being in multiple Realms. For example you could go to another Realm of your home World and meet yourself. The self you met would not be you, it would be that Realm's version of you. It is confusing and I try not to dwell on it much.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Hut</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Hut is a Transdimensional Device that is a cross-breed of magic and technology. It consists of a pocket dimension, where all the internal structures reside, and an interface to the rest of the multiverse. By moving the interface the Hut moves between Realms and time-frames at the will of the Mistress. Because the Hut is a pocket dimension it can easily be changed in terms of rooms and configuration at the will of the Mistress.</p>
