<p class="pagecaption">Hut Tactical Team</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is the Keeper's personal unit for dealing with extreme trouble. This is the team capable of going head to head with large problems and sorting them out. It includes assassins, data gatherers, analysts, technicians, and arcanes capable of dealing with whatever technology and issues arise in very hostile locations. The team was recruited from <a href="../gm_resources/places/planescape/centrys.htm">Centrys</a> and understands the what of the multiverse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Over time the Tac Team swells to include a large number of various races of personel. Their duties expand to include infiltration and data gathering in suspected hot spots. Sometimes they will be given the mission to fix something, other times their data will be sent to another Hut for implementation depending on resources required.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This team is also used to research backgrounds of potential <a href="../gm_resources/info/hutdaughter.htm">Hut Daughters</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Should include someone that has abilities similar to Alexandra of the <a href="../gm_resources/info/carnival.htm">Dark Carnival</a>. Alexandra could be in an early version of the team, but she would want to return to the <a href="../gm_resources/info/carnival.htm">Carnival</a> as soon as a replacement could be found or trained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../gm_resources/npcs/krystal.htm">Krystal</a> will be the head of the Tac Team because of her background under <a href="../gm_resources/npcs/aztol.htm">Aztol</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some of the team should be very good at blending in, seeming harmless, and not worthy of note. They would be the ones to sit in the coffee shops or bars and scope out the lay of things.</p>
