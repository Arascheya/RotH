<p class="regtxt5">The swirling fog in the doorway behind the sphynx statues is a red hering. The Gate is in existance only when a glowing spider web of light is in place between the two statues. The two sphynx statues are carved of worn sandstone. These are similar to the sphynx web statues on Zeltrop, however, the Gate settings are controlled by the Hut and the Controller instead of a control panel on the left sphynx.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">During Margla's residency the Sphynx Web wall has a portal to the DemonWeb instead of the Sphynx Web controller.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Gate can be auto-configured by the NavSys when the Hut jumps to a particular location. For example: when the Hut jumps to Home0, the Outlands near Centrys, the Gate is configured to link to the World Gate dimension. These locations are given in the <a href="navsys.htm">NavSys database</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is the primary gate. It can be directed to send incoming traffic to various special rooms. Arcanes arriving for their tests are directed to the testing area, seekers and gatherers are directed to the Repository, keepers to the crew lounge, etc.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This entire room is constructed of Adamantite.</p>
