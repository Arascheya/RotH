<p class="regtxt5">CH, 10' flat overall; IL, rooms A-D each have 2 CL's, one in each corner, and room E has 4 CL's, one at the top or foot of each stairway.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="mHutRmDetails.htm">Hut Room Details</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">The walls in this area are lined with shelves and boxes full of alchemical materials used in the preparation of magical potions, poisons, inks, medicines, and chemical substances. Many of the materials have deteriorated from age and disuse, and some will now produce altered effects if used in magical rituals or experiments. The contents of these rooms came from numerous worlds, and most of them are labelled as to their origin. Room A contains various acids and caustic liquids; B has an assortment of solid components; C has biological supplies; and room D contains gems and unusual materials (demon ichors, devil scales, and so forth).</p>
<p class="regtxt5">If a magic-user or illusionist looks long enough here, he will probably find any chemical components for his spells or alchemical preparations that he desires. However, as noted above, there is a chance (15%) that whatever materials are found will be useless or will produce unexpected effects if used.</p>
