<p class="pagecaption">Fall-Back Plan</p>

<p class="regtxt5">valen talking to the other two powers about slipping selves and Great Repository out of the multi-verse if the Creator and Destructor cannot be contained. She as urchin, Void as old woman in a black robe, Keeper as Irena, at the 12 Factols</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena was the last to arrive, stepping through the Hut Gate and into the smoky, noisy room. Her sisters were already seated at the small table, with its lone candle. One looked like any disreputable street kid, the other, an old woman in a hooded black robe. She strode to the table and slid down into the third seat. A bar man was at her elbow almost before she was seated. "Lady Irena, what would you like tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* fall-back plan is to attach the Hut to Eternia and the Repository, create the ability to initiate a "big bang", then wait until the multiverse is collapsing. Just as it ends, light off the big bang around the Hut Interface, thus linking the Hut into the very fabric of the new multiverse and removing the Creator/Destructor problem */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was all falling apart. Worlds were dying as great sections of the multi-verse ceased to exist. Valen sat in the throne, staring out at the displays showing the increasing turmoil. Shandi, are you certain this can work?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rail thin, twitchy woman standing next to the throne shrugged. A small oriental woman said, "We ran as many simulations as we could. The patterns look sound, but there was no way to test it. If we are gong to try, we need to start immediately."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kara, recall the sisterhood. We start once they are recovered."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">TYANA: Fall-Back Protocol - Phase Two Active</p>

<p class="regtxt5">TYANA: Fall-Back Protocol Phase Three initialized, See you on the other side</p>

<p class="regtxt5">SHANDI: Now we see if this will really work</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The big band trigger will create a feeling as if the Hut and everything is being compressed into nothingness, then expnding rapidly. In the post-flash stun, a voice will say, "Let there be light"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the glare clears, Tyana will shrug and say, "Well, somebody had to say it."</p>
