<p class="pagecaption">Margla - ONLINE - Diary</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Balance Keeper, I leave you this as an explanation of what has come before. Near the end of this is a section on the Prophecies Of My Release. I don't know exactly what to say to you, now that time grows short. There are so many things I wish I had done differently, although the disaster that lead to the First Triad is what started it all. If I had begun writing at the first Prophecy, maybe I could have left more for you but such is the way of it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At first I was going to place all the information in this one volume. Then I realized it would be easier in several. Here on the Library table are the volumes you should use for reference.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is one about <a href="magic_theory.htm">Magical Theory</a>. This one is notes from the School of Magic on Trilbarash at the Great Well of Worlds. These are some of the interesting ideas I heard as the Mistress of the School.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is a volume on <a href="gate_theory.htm">Gates</a>. This volume deals with the concepts of Dimensional Gates and travels. Many of these notes are from Tesch Mar when he was studying at Trilbarash. I have not heard from Tesch Mar after he left the school so there is no way of knowing if he ever found any proof for his hypothesis.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have also included an additional concept proposed by Kaltereth ni Marasha. She was an ardent follower of Tesch Mar and his theories and hoped to expand on his understanding through her own researches. She was one of the few who sought me out that I deigned to speak with. She was an intelligent and thoughtful Arcane of great promise. After our first encounter we saw each other often.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Interestingly there was some type of techno locking device on the World Gates of the world where Kaltereth was conducting her studies. She didn't have the knowledge necessary to do much more than identify it as such.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My last communication from her said she was headed off with someone named Aztol. He was going to provide her access to other worlds and gates for additional research. I have heard nothing from her since. Should you come across my friend, please render her any assistance you may. I fear however that she is gone.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Addendum: Aztol has come to ask me for information. When I asked about Kaltereth he said she was lost. He is an arrogant, sniveling worm of a man. More mad than anything with a twisted brilliance that has allowed him a following. Be wary of him for he is insane and without honor. He shall seek you once he learns you possess this device.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The third volume is the notes on the construction and operation of this <a href="hut_notes.htm">device</a>. It is an inter-dimensional construct powered by a hybrid of majik and Ancient Magic, that which was once known as "technology".</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Within the Hut is a strange crystal item. I am not sure how to describe it other than to say it is amethyst in color and I am not certain where I left it. It seems to be able to replicate in some strange manner over long periods of time. It allows anyone holding it to see what another person holding one of its siblings sees. I haven't trusted anyone enough to figure out much about it. Maybe it will be of use to you.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Your paths will likely cross the legends of The Hand. Balance Keeper, I hope you can find and stop this being. His use of the Hand and Eye of Azeloth threatens to bring things to an end. I have talked briefly with my acquaintance, She Who Must Never Be Named, and she has told me this being wields the powers of a long dead priest in the service of the Destructor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Hand must be "killed" with the Sword of Lorsan, which will force him back to his stronghold. Then, before he can fully regenerate his form the Hand of Azeloth must be cut from his body. The Hand of Azeloth looks like a withered, fire blackened left hand and forearm when it is regenerating . This must be destroyed by soaking it in the tears of a cat eyed virgin in a lost holy relic of Ertan, known as the Bowl of Purity. She Who Must Never Be Named believes the Eye of Azeloth must be destroyed in a similar fashion, however she has no idea who might be wielding it at this time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Prophecies reveal the only way into the Hand's fortress is with the help of a pair of twins. The bond between them will bridge some type of distortion he has created around his fortress. Without these twins there is no way to gain entry without succumbing to his powers. I believe his fortress resides in <a href="akhalt.htm">Akhalt</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have seen a reference, long ago, in a tome I have been unable to recover, that says one of the twins can be released from her curse by sprinkling her physical form with water in which the Hand and Eye of Azeloth have been dissolved.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">PROPHECIES ABOUT MY RELEASE</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My old friend Kayara has appeared to me in a dream and told me to seek a Gypsy seer of great skill. I have seen the woman and am recording all her statements that I may follow the one path that shall free me.</p>
<p class="sectcapt2">FIRST MEETING</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The web of your destiny entangles many times and many lives, yet I see a strand that may free you. The path is long and full of pain yet you may succeed. You shall have a daughter and she shall be the key to your salvation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A daughter shall be born to you. Once she reaches her first birthday you shall leave her in the desert, in the tent of a wandering band destroyed by the burning sands. At the edge of the burning Galhai Wastes where the City of the Watchers, Imlythalium, stands proud. A woman of the Red Street shall rescue her and foster her for a time. This girl shall grow strong and powerful. She shall be touched by the High Elder, the Perverter of Spiders, and come at last to the Balance Keeper. Through all she shall come into her own power.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Come to me again once your daughter has been rescued by the Lady of the Red Street.</p>
<p class="sectcapt2">FOSTERING OF MY DAUGHTER</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A Second Triad must be formed. It shall be their purpose to take the place of the Three-As-One, the First Triad, that you now are. The three shall come from diverse places. One shall be your <a href="../gm_resources/npcs/krystal.htm">daughter</a>, touched by the Perverter of Spiders and returned to you by the conveyance that brings the other two. The other two I have not yet seen.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Another triad must be formed. This shall be known as the Weapons Triads and they shall be the protectors of the Second Triad. To them falls the honor of protection and service. More shall I know about them as the time for your release approaches.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Patience must you have for the unfolding of your destiny requires time for your daughter to grow. Seek me again in the thirteenth Naramahasan from now. More will I know then.</p>
<p class="sectcapt2">NARAMAHASAN MEETING</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Your daughter is well. She prepares for her destiny even now, though she knows nothing of it as yet. Know then that this is what you must do.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Your daughter shall require a weapon. This weapon shall protect her and bring her to the Hut when it is time. This weapon shall be <a href="../gm_resources/items/scorpion.htm">Scorpion Tooth</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Scorpion Tooth shall create living armor around the hand of the wielder. It shall also possess the ability to shoot a Jamis Thorn once each day. The final enchantments shall bind it to the Hut as a tracking device and give it the power to detect undead and demon taint. Scorpion Tooth shall have a spirit bound to it so that it may attune itself to its wielder and power its own detection spells.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Scorpion Tooth must you place in the hands of your daughter when she is driven from her home in the House of Nilyarma of Imlythalium. She may know it came from you only upon your death.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Come to me again at the falling of the leaves, on this the home of your birth, in the lands of your place.</p>
<p class="sectcapt2">WHEN THE LEAVES FELL</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In a twist of Fate worthy of the Epics themselves has been revealed the second of the Second Triad. She shall be a <a href="../gm_resources/npcs/shandi.htm">Time Dancer</a>, one who has crossed and re-crossed the oceans of time, she who has been touched by the Perverter of Spiders himself. Twisted, yet unbroken, she shall achieve a peace of sorts as the Second of the Triad. She shall wear the <a href="../gm_resources/items/bracers.htm">Bracers of the Assassin</a> that you created for Aristandilus Raisul in the time of the rise of Kharatoum. She shall have recovered them from the floating city of Vilyanu where they were taken by the Mad Mage after the fall of Kharatoum. Gifted to her by a friend, they draw from her poisons similar to those that afflict you.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Again I must urge patience for you must wait to come to me for another twenty seven zyrodyls. Then seek me at Mahasan and I shall tell you more.</p>
<p class="sectcapt2">MAHASAN MEETING</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Weapons Triad requires weapons to serve them in their duties to the Second Triad. One of the Weapons Triad shall come with weapons. You must create a <a href="../gm_resources/items/dagger.htm">dagger</a>, and a <a href="../gm_resources/items/katana.htm">katana</a>. The weapons master Hiromata, weapons master to the Jewel of the Lotus, shall craft the weapons. The enchantments shall be created by you based on the prophecies and this shall be the making of them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The dagger blade shall be formed of simple weapons steel, the finest Hiromata can forge, and it shall be set into a handle of demon bone. The likeness of a goat shall be carved on it. Bind into this weapon the hooks for holding spells that you may store two in it when you shall have finished its creation. At the time of its completion the first two spells you think of shall be the ones it carries.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The katana must be an exact replica of the katana he forged before the Hell Gate Wars. Into this weapon you must bind many and various majiks. The greatest of which shall be the spell binding it to the hut and binding it to its wielder. This spell shall be the link by which you shall bind the wielder to the hut when the time of your freedom is at hand.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Those that shall wield these weapons I have not yet seen. Nor have I seen the last of the Second Triad. The mists of time are clouded by the powers of the Factions that seek to pierce them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Seek me again once the weapons have been enchanted.</p>
<p class="sectcapt2">WEAPONS COMPLETE MEETING</p>
<p class="regtxt5">More have I seen. The Triads shall be hunted by the Perverter of Spiders. He has linked them to an Arcane that escaped from him, the one who assisted him in the enacting of a cruel revenge.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And it shall come to pass that the undoing of this curse shall be of great complication. The Weapons Triad shall exist more to assist a shadowy force for your salvation that as a protection for the Second Triad. The mists swirl heavily over the turning of it. Yet the glimpses show a strange and foggy shifting. Ghost echoes shall be the key, ghost echoes in the mists of time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">More there is to see, more shall I reveal at the turning of the seasons.</p>
<p class="sectcapt2">TURNING OF THE SEASONS</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have seen the horror of the final weapon. It is one that has feasted upon you of old. The dread blade <a href="../gm_resources/items/souleater.htm">Soul Eater</a> is required for your release and it shall come to you as booty from one seeking audience with you upon the Plains of Neutrality. I have not yet seen who shall be cursed with this foul blade, for the bearer is shrouded in the mists of uncertainty.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Weapons Triad is still blurred by the mists. Come to me in midwinter.</p>
<p class="sectcapt2">MIDWINTER MEETING</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Two members of the Weapons Triads shall come from across the rift of time and stars. Into the hands of the one known as <a href="../gm_resources/npcs/lynn.htm">Engineer</a> shall you give the katana. Into the hands of the one called <a href="../gm_resources/npcs/kara.htm">Captain</a> shall you give the dagger.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The <a href="../gm_resources/npcs/angelique.htm">last</a> of the Weapons Triad shall be found by the Time Dancer herself. This third shall be the last key to the Time Dancer’s sanity. This one is hidden from me. All I know is this one shall come from an unexpected place and time and shall already possess the weapon necessary.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is one who remains. She shall be the last of the Second Triad and she shall be the Key Wielder, she whom shall replace you. Still she hides in the shadows. Come once more to me at the Dark of Both Moons, then shall I try again to pierce the veils and bring forth her identity.</p>
<p class="sectcapt2">DARK OF BOTH MOONS</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The last of the Second Triad shall also come from beyond the rift of time. It is her blood, the blood of the <a href="../gm_resources/npcs/valen.htm">Balance Keeper</a>, from which you descend. She knows it not for this came from her in ways she did not know. Into her hands shall you place Soul Eater for she alone possesses the strength to control this fell creation. You must tell her that it is a weapon of great effect. On its edge balances many things. It may bring <a href="../gm_resources/npcs/thehand.htm">The Hand</a> to power and set loose the <a href="../gm_resources/gods/destructor.htm">Destructor</a>, or it may cripple the Hand and aid in his defeat. You shall know her for she shall resemble you, even more than your daughter shall resemble you.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Triads shall come to you in the city of Miskaton. There shall you place into their hands the weapons and items required. None must know who you are.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have spoken of this course now for many years, yet I must now tell you, while there is still time, of the ending of this. Your release shall also be your death. It is not too late to turn from this path should you desire. Your torment will continue and the Consumer shall slowly grow stronger. In time it shall bring a fading to your power and the power of your associate, She Who Must Never Be Named. With that fading the City of Doors shall become vulnerable. There are many who would seek its dominance, yet the one poised is the one working in the background to undermine the entire planar structure through ill-advised experimentation and blatant arrogance. He heeds not the wisdom of the powers in his actions. This one, the Perverter of Spiders, is the arrogant upstart that has repeatedly assaulted your peace.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The final key to this shall be the gathering of the Triads in Miskaton. At this time agents of the Hand shall have sat in conference with the Faceless One. A Razak demon shall have turned from its path of evil and shall actively seek alliance with the Faceless One and an explanation of its purpose on this plane. When all are in proximity, then shall the Second Triad be brought in and the transference take place. The Weapons Triad must remain in the Places of Assembling; only in this way shall the bonds of love, shared by the Captain and the Balance Keeper, be the way of return.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soul Eater must be driven into your heart by the hand of the Balance Keeper as the Hut reweaves itself around the new Triad. The horns of Soul Eater shall hold a <a href="../gm_resources/items/binding_crystal.htm">Gem of Holding and Binding</a> into which the <a href="../gm_resources/monsters/consumer.htm">Consumer</a> shall flow. This shall free you and She Who Must Never Be Named. For only by this action will their lives be spared, lest all shall die with you. No more is there to tell. Now there is only the doing or the not doing of the thing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This message in particular must you leave those who come after.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Know you that you hold the fates of many in your hands. Your drawing to this place is for more than the freeing of an Old One. Powers there are, some in the shadows, some in the light, all with their own purposes. Few will guide you, many will seek to use you. You may seek me should you desire prophecy for yourselves. Old Yara will give what help she may. As shall the love of the Time Dancer, a powerful Seer in her own right.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">TO MY DAUGHTER - AND ALL OTHERS</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My daughter you are beloved of me. I shall not curse you with the guiding of this device. To that I leave the Balance Keeper, she from whom we descend. I am sorry you must learn of me in this way. I wish it had been different. Through the years I have seen you grow to a woman of great strength and courage. Know that I am proud of you.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Balance Keeper, I know not how your blood came to flow in my veins. Perhaps the Seer Yara could explain it, perhaps not. It has given me the courage to see this through. Use this construct wisely, for the seer has revealed you are the only one capable of this task. The three of you in the Second Triad are considered permanent residents of the Hut. You may grant this to others as you wish. Balance Keeper, you may also grant access to other Hut abilities as you choose, however only you may control the moving of it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Within this Construct are the methods for the using of it. You shall have no trouble divining them for yourself.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../gm_resources/npcs/klktzash.htm">Klktzash</a>, the librarian, has remained, even when I sent all others away. She has refused to leave the library and her books. I would ask that you allow her to stay. She will not harm any resident of the Hut so long as her library is not threatened. I have left her bound to the Hut since she refused release. I am sorry for what I have done to you and hope you can forgive me.</p>
