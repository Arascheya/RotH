<p class="pagecaption">Hut Book - Madison</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My daughter, I leave you this as an explanation of what has come before. Near the end of this is a section on the prophecies of my release. I don’t know exactly what to say to you, now that time grows short. There are so many things that could have been different. So many things I wish I had done differently, although the disaster that lead to the First Triad is what started it all. There is so much I should have said if this had been a real diary instead of random notes.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Tesch Mar Hypothesis</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Unified Universal Magic</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Magic is the use of naturally occurring energies to achieve a desired result. These energies are universal and well defined. Any form of magic inherently draws upon these energies regardless of the method used for gathering. The gathering methods are just different techniques taught to access the same energies. Some techniques are easier to master and thus are easier to teach and use.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Each spell is a pattern of energy control that produces a predictable and desired result. These patterns may be taught or learned by intense study and experimentation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Each spell consists of several distinct sections. The first section is the preparation of the user's awareness and concentration, allowing the user to visualize the energies used to create the desired pattern. The second section is the actual construction of the magical pattern for the spell and draws on the inherent psychic power of the user. The third section is the gathering and binding of external, supplemental energy required by the spell. This step often requires additional energies from the user to control the gathered energy. The final step is the targeting and release of the finished spell.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Spells are taught as complete patterns to the neophyte, only as the user's skill and abilities grow is the user able to figure out how to change the amount of external energy required to vary the effect of the spell. Subtle changes in the pattern creation will allow changing the range or area of effect of the spell.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Magic identification is done by following the patterning of the spell(s) on the item in question. To be adept at this skill the identifier must have had exposure to a broad base of spells and pattern examples.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Items are created by first weaving a binding spell (enchant) into the material parts of the item. Once the item is assembled then the actual effect spell(s) are woven into the hooks left by the enchant base spell.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A 12th level spell, Encryption, allows the creator of an item to put a randomized pattern into the overall pattern of the item. This randomizer constantly changes so it is very difficult to unweave the magic on the item. Exhaustive research is required to attempt to dispel magic that has been encrypted this way. Usually this requires access to many spells and items created by the developer of the item to be dispelled. The caster of the encryption can unweave this pattern at any time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">End of Tesch Mar Hypothesis</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Tesch Mar Thesis Brief</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Gates</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are two forms of gates on the average world. These are the "Natural" gate and the "Hell" gate. Both come into being where the boundary between "Real Space" (an Ancient term for the Prime Material Plane) and the "Gate Dimension" are thin. Through my researches I intend to determine the usual number and placement strategy of these gates. I also plan to prove the connection between Hell gates and Natural gates. I believe the two are connected phenomenon.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Further I hope to prove these gates are actually linked to local magical nodes (called Earth Nodes in some papers) in some way. I plan to prove these gate nodes are actually super nodes in the earth node network. As such mathematical analysis indicates there should be seven super nodes for each local network in the Prime Material Plan. (mathematical modeling based on the Tesch Mar Hypothesis of Unified Universal Magic)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Natural gates may be used to travel between places in the Prime Material Plane. All that is required is the appropriate magic spells. These gates may be stabilized with powerful spells and held in one place, otherwise they tend to open, close, and drift randomly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hell gates open, close and drift similar to Natural gates but their stabilization requires sacrifices of sentient beings at each gate location.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">End of Tesch Mar Thesis Brief</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I still have not heard from Tesch Mar again. The last message said he had found an ideal place to begin his researches and he was going to build his residence there. Damn, and I so wanted to know his results. He was the most promising of the students at the school in so many years.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Margla's Corollary to Tesch Mar Hypothesis</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Majik and energy are similar things. Majik can be used and controlled like energy. Given suitable devices majik should be able to be interfaced to technological artifacts. Some type of energy resonant device must be the key to this effect.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">End of Margla's Corollary</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It works, I have combined a techno device and a majik spell! So far it is crude but it will work. The hardest part was creating an operating system hook in the small computer of the techno device that could read and interpret the majik energies linked to the thought crystal interface. I wish Kayara was still around, she was an absolute genius with software, particularly operating systems, and could have written a new system to handle all of this. I must acquire more computer equipment, maybe a larger system will work better.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Now that old hyperdrive engine has finally come in useful. It’s been a real bother having to stay near it to ease the pain. It will form the techno part of the core of a new device, a linking of majik and tech the likes the universe has never seen. Around it will be woven a shell of majik and techno energies, self replicating and sustaining, that will be able to form ‘matter’ and ‘substance’. In it I will be able to roam the universe and still keep that damn anchor near me.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There will be several main class types in this construct - one will be based on the fundamentals of ‘real space’ matter, this will be the absolute base class, ZeroRM, and will provide the inheritance for all other classes. Derived from it will be StaticRM, TransRM. StaticRM will be alterable by me and only me, TransRM will be modifiable by anyone who shares this place with me. Further derivation will yield StaticObj and TransObj. StaticObj will be to objects as StaticRM but for objects and items that I might wish to have around me. TransObj will provide the same function as TransRM. AttachObj, LinkEntity, and AttachEntity will allow ‘real space’ objects and beings to be linked into the construct so they can be moved with it. All of this will be done in majik and tech, kind of a true ‘multi-platform’ approach.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Room objects may contain several room objects allowing a suite of rooms to be considered a single instance object in the hut operating environment. A classic example is the library StaticRM object which is composed of several StaticRM objects.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">LinkEntity - 1 Instance - me</p>
<p class="regtxt9">AttachEntity - Instances vary with number of guests</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It works. I just don’t think I’ll ever try to relink anything at the ZeroRM level - the first, and only, time I tried it, it hurt so much I wasn’t sure I could even get through the start-up procedures. So far I have been able to visit anywhere and not have troubles. The construct is powered by both majik and techno and seems able to function in areas where one or both types of energy exist.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have found a strange crystal entity? It allows two or more beings to share power for resisting attacks but apparently not for casting spells. It allows transference of pictures from one mind to another also. I will have to research this further when I have more time, once I remember where I put it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have found the Hand's weakness! Now I can negotiate from a position of strength! The Lady of Pain has given me scraps of the old legends, the ones dealing with artifacts known as the Hand and Eye of Azeloth. Azeloth was the high priest of  the Destructor, the deity responsible for endings.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He must be "killed" with the Sword of Lorsan, which will force him back to his stronghold. Then, before he can fully regenerate his form the Hand of Azeloth must be recovered. These item looks like a withered, fire blackened left hand and forearm. This must be destroyed by soaking it in the tears of a cat eyed virgin in a lost holy relic of Ertan, known as the Bowl of Purity.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The last open hellgate can be sealed with the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs, another lost artifact of Ertan. <a href="../gm_resources/info/valen_notes.htm">Valen Notes</a> - additional data pulled from the Hut systems</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The only way into the Hand's fortress is with the help of a pair of twins. Something about a bond between them bridging the distortions he has created about his fortress.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have seen a reference, long ago, in a tome I have been unable to recover, that says something about one of the twins that helped access the Hand's fortress being released from a curse by sprinkling her physical form with water in which the Hand and Eye of Azeloth have been dissolved.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Another curiosity has come my way. I currently have it stored in the Bestiary. It is a creature that engulfs its prey and then assumes its form. Currently it is in the form of a large dog. I found it in a cold area as it fled from a group of burning buildings. At that time it was in humanoid form until it saw a large dog which it fell upon and devoured. It is similar to the "possessors" the Hand has contracted me to transport, although it doesn’t seem to be as adept at host memory assimilation as the "possessors".</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">PROPHECIES ABOUT MY RELEASE</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My old friend Kayara has appeared to me in a dream and told me to seek a Gypsy seer of great skill. I have seen the woman and am recording all her statements that I may follow the one path that shall free me.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">FIRST MEETING</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The web of your destiny entangles many times and many lives, yet I see a strand that may free you. The path is long and full of pain yet you may succeed. You shall have two daughters and they shall be the keys to your salvation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">One shall be born of a desert nomad and left to foster with his tribe. You shall feign death as the mother of the child, seeking respite from the burning sands that took your mate. This girl shall grow strong and powerful. She shall be touched by the High Elder, the Perverter of Spiders, and the Butcher. Through all she shall come into her own power.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The second daughter shall be born of a chance encounter. More I will not know until the birth of your first daughter. Seek me then.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">BIRTH OF MY FIRST DAUGHTER</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Your second daughter shall be fathered by a random encounter in the city of your friend, the Lady of Pain. Seek drink and distraction at the Twelve Factols 7 zerads from now. The father of your child shall be a worlder that has wandered to the City of Doors by accident. He shall spend his last pleasant night in your embrace. You shall not consume him, for he is destined to fall elsewhere in the service of another power. Seek me once more when your second daughter’s birth is near.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">SECOND DAUGHTER BIRTH IS NEAR</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once she is born you will take her to the place where the Eldest of the Seven was punished by the One from Before, the one known as the High Elder. Here was the Perverter of Spiders created and here was the place where three times met and became one. Go to the tower of the Star Mages and search for the Cavern of the Gate nearby. Within its depths shall you see the way to the place your daughter must go. This must you do before you leave your daughter. Make for her a duplicate of the Key to your Hut. This Key must be an identical copy of yours and bound to it as if they were one. Bind it to her in a pocket place that is with her always. It shall open if anything should happen to you. Trust the settings upon the Gate Lock for they are the ones for the time and the place of your daughter’s fostering. Place her where the blue baby is.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once this is in motion seek me again in thirteen Naramahasans when I shall know more.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">NARAMAHASAN MEETING</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Your daughters are well. They prepare for their destinies even now, though they know nothing of them as yet. Know then that this is what you must do.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Three triads must be formed. The first shall be known as the Second Triad. It shall be their purpose to take the place of the Three-As-One, the First Triad, that you now are. The other two shall be known as the Weapons Triads and they shall be the protectors of the Second Triad. To them falls the honor of protection and service.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Second Triad must be formed of three that shall come from diverse places and times. Your daughter fostered where the Perverter of Spiders was created shall be one. She shall be returned to you through another continuum. She carries the duplicate Key and through this Key will you be able to help this Triad survive. Another shall also strive for them, using her majiks for her own desires.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The second shall possess the Bracers of the Assassin that you created for Aristandilus Raisul in the time of the rise of Kharatoum.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The final member of this triad shall come from a far away place, a place where you formed the first arcane school. More shall I know of him later..</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The weapons for the Weapons Triads are still hidden from me. Seek me at Mahasan and I shall know more.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">MAHASAN MEETING</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You must create several weapons for the Weapons Triads. Those that I have seen are a flute, two daggers, a bastard sword, and a katana. The weapons shall be crafted by the weapons master Hiromata, weapons master to the Jewel of the Lotus. The enchantments shall be created by you based on the prophecies.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The flute is part of the Weapons Triads arsenal for it shall sustain its wielder and thus keep the strength of the Triads undiminished. Into this flute shall be placed the spell of charming. This charming will be in the form of music so sweet and delightful to the hearers that any thought of free will and opposition shall be driven from them. The wielder may suggest actions to any listener that will be followed as long as they are not deliberately hurtful to the listener. Further the flute shall be able to fire a sleeping dart at a single target once each day. This dart shall render the target to sleep for a duration based on the target’s physical strength, but for no less time than half of a night.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Two daggers shall be made. The first, Scorpion Tooth, shall create living armor around the hand of the wielder. In combat it will grow a majikal tail ending in a stinger that will dispense paralysis poison each time it hits. The Scorpion Tooth must first have tasted of the flesh of the victim before it can sting. The final enchantments shall bind it to the Hut as a tracking device and give it the power to detect undead and demon taint. Scorpion Tooth shall have a spirit bound to it so that it may attune itself to its wielder and power its own detection spells.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The second dagger blade shall be formed of simple weapons steel, the finest Hiromata can forge, and it shall be set into a handle of demon bone. The likeness of a goat shall be carved on it. Bind into this weapon the hooks for holding spells that you may store two in it when you shall have finished its creation. At the time of its completion the first two spells you think of shall be the ones it carries.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The bastard sword shall be crafted in the same way as the goat dagger. Once again the spells it shall contain shall be the first that you think of once it is completed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The katana must be an exact replica of the katana he forged before the Hell Gate Wars. Into this weapon you must bind many and various majiks. The greatest of which shall be the spell binding it to the hut and binding it to its wielder. This spell shall be the link by which you shall bind the wielder to the hut when the time of your freedom is at hand.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Scorpion Tooth must you place in the hands of your first daughter when she is driven from her home in the brothel of Altarkran. She may know it came from you only upon your death.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The owner of the katana will be the son of the owner of the original katana. He shall receive a katana from his family that is said to have come down from the Hell Gate Wars. This must be the replacement you have enchanted rather than the original his mother carried. The family realizes not what it has.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The owner of the second dagger will be a friend of the owner of the katana. He shall receive the dagger from his family that is said to have come down from the Hell Gate Wars. This must be the replacement you have enchanted rather than the original his father carried. The family realizes not what it has.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The bastard sword shall be gifted to the companion of your daughter as she returns from the other continuum.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Those that shall wield these weapons I have not yet seen. Nor have I seen the other members of the Second Triad. The mists of time are clouded by the powers of the Factions that seek to pierce them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Seek me again once the weapons have been enchanted.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">WEAPONS COMPLETE MEETING</p>
<p class="regtxt5">More have I seen. The Triads shall be hunted by the Perverter of Spiders. He has linked them to an Arcane that escaped from him, the one who assisted him in the enacting of a cruel revenge. Kaltereth has mentored the One Who is Two. From her he learned the beginnings of the art. The forces of the prophecy shall bring the Triads together at the holding of Raisilian as the Perverter seeks them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">More there is to see, more shall I reveal at the turning of the seasons.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">TURNING OF THE SEASONS</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The second of the Second Triad shall bring to you that which was lost. That which you lost during the time of the battles at the Gate of Skelos shall he wear. With him shall also be the backup controller you will need as you free yourself.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In a twist of Fate worthy of the Epics themselves has been revealed the third of the Second Triad. She shall be a Time Dancer, one who has crossed and re-crossed the oceans of time, she who has been touched by the Perverter of Spiders himself. Twisted, yet unbroken, she shall achieve a peace of sorts as the last of the Triad. She shall wear the Bracers of the Assassin, recovered from the floating city of Vilyanu where they were taken by the Mad Mage after the fall of Kharatoum. Gifted to her by a friend, they draw from her poisons similar to those that afflict you.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have seen the horror of the final weapon. It is one that has feasted upon you of old. The dread blade Soul Eater is required for your release and it shall come to you as booty from one seeking audience with you upon the Outlands plane. I have not yet seen who shall be cursed with this foul blade, for the bearer is shrouded in the mists of uncertainty.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Weapons Triads are still blurred by the mists. Come to me in midwinter.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">MIDWINTER MEETING</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The final members of the Weapons Triads shall come from across the rift of time and stars. Into the hands of the flying one shall you place the flute. Her part to play is unclear, yet she must survive and become one of the Weapon Bearers.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The second one from beyond the rift of time shall have in her blood that from which you descend. She knows it not for this came from her in ways she did not know. Into her hands shall you place Soul Eater for she alone possesses the strength to control this fell creation. You must tell her that it is a weapon of great effect. On its edge balances many things. It may bring the Hand to power and set loose the Destructor, or it may cripple the Hand and aid in his defeat.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We have spoken of this course now for many years, yet I must now tell you, while there is still time, of the ending of this. Your release shall also be your death. It is not too late to turn from this path should you desire. Your torment will continue and the consumer shall slowly grow stronger. In time it shall bring a fading to your power and the power of your associate, the Lady of Pain. With that fading the City of Doors shall become vulnerable. There are many who would seek its dominance, yet the one poised is the one working in the background to undermine the entire planar structure through ill-advised experimentation and blatant arrogance. He heeds not the wisdom of the powers in his actions.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The time shall be at hand when agents of the Hand shall have sat in conference with the Faceless One. A Razak demon shall have turned from its path of evil and shall actively seek alliance with the Faceless One and an explanation of its purpose on this plane. The transference shall occur when the Ageless Child, she whom you know as Sharyl, brings forth the Gem of Summoning and the final chord tolls. Soul Eater must be driven into your heart by the hand of your mother from beyond time as the Hut reweaves itself around the new Triad. For only by this action will their lives be spared, lest all shall die with you. No more is there for me to tell. Now there is only the doing or the not doing of the thing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This message in particular must you leave those who come after.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Know you that you hold the fates of many in your hands. Your drawing to this place is for more than the freeing of an Old One. Powers there are, some in the shadows, some in the light, all with their own purposes. Few will guide you, many will seek to use you. You may seek me should you desire prophecy for yourselves. Old Yara will give what help she may.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">TO MY DAUGHTERS - AND ALL OTHERS</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My daughter you are the Chosen, the Controller, for you bear the Key. Treat your sister well, offing her a place within the Hut, or assistance as she goes her own way. You will be the only one able to use all the functions of this construct. To use any hut function you must visualize the desired result, then the hut will activate and grant it. You may command the hut to walk, or 3 times a day you may tell the hut to go to a place you have visualized. This may be anywhere. To allow others to use some of the hut functions (i.e. automatic door opening or cauldron control) you must visualize the desired function followed by the image of the person you want able to use the function. To remove a person follow the same procedure but then visualize a red circle with a red slash over the person. You may query the hut by visualizing something you want information on. Anyone added to hut functions is considered a permanent resident and may use the cauldron.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This hut is currently set in its minimum configuration. You can add more rooms but cannot delete any that currently exist. You can however change which rooms connect to which other rooms.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To the others of the Second Triad, the Weapons Triads, and any others accompanying them when I was freed, I leave this hut to you. I ask that the Second Triad allow any who desire to live here the opportunity do to so. Klktzash, the librarian, has remained, even when I sent all others away. She has refused to leave the library and her books. I would ask that you allow her to stay. She will not harm any resident of the Hut so long as her library is not threatened. I have left her bound to the Hut since she refused release. I am sorry for what I have done to you and hope you can forgive me.</p>
