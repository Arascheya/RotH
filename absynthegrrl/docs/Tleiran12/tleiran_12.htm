<p>Pain exploded in SnowDancer's head as the hut systems painted a bright red dot into the status display. Instantly it expanded to show the power systems and a red blotch where the backup power unit had been. Next the warning, "Jump Unstable - Drives Offline - Jump Abort-Terminated" flashed as a deep gong echoed through the room around her. The very air rippled and shimmered as even more pain flashed through her, this time as if her entire being was being pulled apart, atom by atom. The pain crescendoed into liquid fire, then cut off as she lost consciousness.</p>

<p>Consciousness returned slowly, leaving in its wake a persistent headache and a silence deeper than any she had experienced in many, many years. She peered into it, realizing that Kara’s presence was missing. Panic surged through her as she feared Kara was dead. It faded as she realized Kara’s presence was quiet, not silent. "Tyana, Teleport please - Throne to Engineering" she thought into the data streams.</p>

<p>"Warning - Power systems not stable. Teleport off-line" flashed back to her. With a muttered groan she clawed her way up from the dragon skeleton throne and staggerd down from its platform. Behind it she half fell half climbed down the ladder-shaft to a rough hewn rock tunnel which was the Engineering connecting cooridor. She almost dropped on a wiry dark olive skinned woman who was reaching for the lowest rungs of the ladder. The woman's dark olive complexion was a sickly greenish and her eyes were glassy. "Sorry Krys..."</p>

<p>She began speaking almost before Snow could even get a word out, "Kara and Will took the full blast of the explosion and Kyira took a nasty hit too. They were running routine checks on the auxiliary power systems when it exploded. The auto-repair spells and systems don’t seem to be coping with the damage."</p>

<p>"How is Kara? Kyira, Will?"</p>

<p>"Same thing. I was able to heal some of their injuries, but they're still comatose. Shan and I have moved them into room zero. I don't know what else to do..."</p>

<p>"I don't either. Regular healing doesn't work with us linked into this thing. Looks like Shan's right, entropy is catching up to us." She leaned against the wall as a surge of dizziness pulsed through her. A quick glance showed Krystyl leaning against the other wall. For a moment she focused inward again and checked the hut status displays. "Looks like primary power is severely depleted too. Guess we'd better find out where we are." Snow turned and headed back up the ladder. Krystyl followed along close behind.</p>

<p>They emerged back into a huge columned hall. High overhead where the arched ceiling should have been a spiral galaxy drifted in the depths of space. Their voices echoed in the hollows of the room as Snow moved back to the steps she's just descended. Moving slowly she settled herself back into the cushions of the bone throne. An ornate massive wooden chair and platform appeared as Krystal moved to sit as well.</p>

<p>With a quick flick of thought Snow painted a data window in the space in front of them that quickly wrapped around their platform. "OK Tyana, show us what we've got." The image of a dark narrow alley faded into view on the screen. Dirty blank walls bordered it on two sides. Rusty metal ladders clung tenaciously to the walls at various points, reaching to their tops far above. Grey poured stone filled the gap between and bits of paper and other detritus swirled along its surface, pushed about by stray puffs of wind. Concentrating a bit more she slowly spun the view to show they were near one of the walls. Immediately to one side of them was a large metal container. "Tyana, please show the interface direction." A dotted red line appeared in the image outlining a section of the open alley.</p>

<p>A thought command from Snow brought a faint pulse of pain to both of them. "There, we look just like that metal box. I hope it isn’t too odd for two of them to be sitting near each other. Tyana, could you check local conditions?"</p>

<p>"Local gravity and atmosphere are acceptable. There is a bit more oxygen in the mix and gravity will be a bit heavier. There is a lot of EM radiation and the air has elevated levels of various organic toxins. Long term exposure will incur risk, especially with the auto-repair systems not functioning. The EM traffic appears to contain large amounts of data, shall I attempt to interpret?"</p>

<p>"Please, and keep me updated. I’ll be in room zero." Snow stood once more and made her way back to the ladder. "Krys, you want the display?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I want to see what the locals look like."</p>

<p>Snow slid down the ladder, turned left and began walking down the tunnel. Gravity began to fall off as she moved closer to the door at then end of the passage. It door opened into a featureless spherical room covered in non-descript fabric. Three still forms floated near its center. With a gentle push she drifted over to them. One was a human male, the second a human female, the third was a bat winged humanoid female. Snow drifted to the woman and stared for long moments at her burned face and torn skin. "It’ll be all right love. We’ll find a way to fix this thing." She drifted in silence, one hand curled around Kara’s, until Tyana's voice broke through to her.</p>

<p>"I've got something, it's sketchy right now. The data speeds are
incredible and the coding is extremely complex. So far all I've managed is a partial decode of some type of journal or something. It deals with a project called Puma. If it's to be believed there should be enough tech here to get what we need. At least your implant stuff and basic equipment. There's a curious lack of information on any sort of off-planet exploration or capability in the fragments I've gotten."</p>

<p>"Link me to the Puma stuff." Moments later the data painted into her
awareness and she quickly scanned through it. "Can you get me any kind of local mapping? I'd like to see where this Chatsubo place is."</p>

<p>"Maybe in a bit.... this stuff is really dense." She went back to drifting until Tyana broke in once more. "I think I've got it. Here." A
two-dimensional map floated into view with a red spot on it. Several minutes later a green dot appeared right next to it. "If I have the decode right, we should be right next to it."</p>

<p>"How strange. I'll go check it out. I need to do something or I'll go
crazy." She spoke softly to Kara, "Gotta go love. Gotta do something, anything... I'll be back soon, you just take it easy." She thought she felt a slight squeeze from the silently floating woman as she carefully withdrew her hand. Using careful swimming motions she eased herself back to the door and hurried toward the entrance. "Tyana, send me a scan of our surroundings, I'm headed out. Let everyone know and I'll yell if I need help. Can we keep our comm secure in all this hash?"</p>

<p>"So far I think so. Our encoding scheme is very different from what I'm seeing."</p>
</br>

<p>PROCESS - BeginMain (Ref=SnowDancer ) </p>

<p>Slowly she eased the heavy oak door open and looked out into the night. Cold wind swirled into the warmth of the hall at her back, bringing bits of refuse in with it. She sucked in a deep breath and stepped out, closing the side of the dumpster behind her. Light-spill from the ends of the alley painted it in shades of grey and black. The damp night air and wind quickly oozed into her and stiffened her injured knee in an all-too-familiar way. She limped quietly but confidently toward the near end of the alley. Neon and sodium light threw fitful pools into the blackness of the night. Traffic of various kinds slid by as she turned left and walked in the direction her map said should lead to her target.</p>

<p>The end of the block appeared along with the flickering neon sign she expected. She hesitated a small moment, then pushed open the door and limped in. She had intended to head to the bar and try for information but a conversation stopped her partway there. A group at one of the farther tables were talking about names from the file fragments she had read, "I'm reluctant to tell you what I thought of Visage, because it's possible I perceive him very differently than he was, but I guess I will anyway. He was so...disconnected. He was this exquisite soul but with nothing to really _care_ about. And he wanted something so badly that he gave his life for it, without hesitation. A tragic hero with flaws I can really sympathize with." Someone in worn and wrinkled clothing was saying.</p>

<p>They looked up as one of them noticed the woman limping their way. She was around 5 ft 6, with silver hair left long and braided. There were lines around her eyes and mouth, leaving her looking neither old nor young. She was dressed in a worn and tattered olive drab flight suit with I. Katarya on the name tag. As she drew near the table she executed a faint bow. Speaking quietly she said, "Please pardon my intrusion, but I heard you talking of Neko and Visage."</p>

<p>The previous speaker bowed in return, with the same depth and duration. "No intrusion. If I had wanted privacy, " he said with a faint smile, "you wouldn't have heard me speaking." He gestured vaguely to a small bundle of electronics on the table. A standard noise muffler with a few mods haphazardly epoxied to the matte black casing.</p>

<p>Snow spoke again, "I also enjoyed both Puma and ISON, and I also had a few moments of confusion realizing they were about the same woman. I only recently came across the diary of their events and have been searching the net for more. Alas I have found plenty of fantastic art, but no new stories. I am really curious about what happened to Dyne and how his relationship to Neko changed over time. Especially after the changes that occurred in Neko..." She paused in thought for a moment, the continued, "I’m glad Rune perceived him right. That is the way I saw him also. The romantic in my soul very much wanted him to survive, even though he took himself to his own end." Unshed tears glistened in her eyes as she joined the toast, "To Visage"</p>

<p>He lifted his glass again, "To Visage. I agree. I wanted him to live too, but after a while, I realized he'd done something very special. And very unusual. He stayed true. Didn't sell out, back off, or change. He paid the ultimate price with the ultimate cash--blood. He paid it because that was who he was...and he'd rather lose...lose and die, than be something else."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, I'm Va..SnowDancer." The old name came unbidden to her
lips, only to be choked back at the last moment. No use inviting trouble from the past if it had reached here too.</p>

<p>"Rune," replied the man who had bowed.</p>

<p>"It is a very strange thing to be ripped from your own place and dropped unsuspecting into another..." She paused, seeing again places from her past, then shook her head to clear the fog.</p>

<p>Rune could practically feel his prosthetic spine creak, seeing and feeling his own history. "Every bit as bad to be cast out of your place, forbidden to return," he said, cryptically.</p>

<p>"I probably should intrude no longer." She turned to leave.</p>

<p>His head snapped up from his musing, "Nice to meet you..." She turned back as he finished, and sat down pondering a long knife he had strapped to his belt, absentmindedly rubbing the matching scar on his stomach. Spoils of battle.</p>

<p>"I am obviously new here if you have time later I would not mind a bit of conversation, it seems we both might have interesting tales to tell..."</p>

<p>Startled, Rune pulled his hand away from the knife. "Oh, the blade," he said, lamely, "not really my style. It's a reminder--the streets are never safe."</p>

<p>His eyes clouded with the remembering. "I was corporate--GalletoCo. An electrical engineer. Used to come down here for fun...you know, fascination with the dark side of the street. Never really fit in. You might not know it right off the bat, but these guys can tell their own. One day my boss gives me a courier bag, asks me to carry it to our chiba
lab," he frowned. "I should've known it was trouble. I got jumped on my way here. Barely got away--I was lucky. This," he pointed to his holstered .45, "was more of a fashion statement back then; I learned to use it the hard way. I made it in here. Thought I was safe, you know. Who starts trouble in the Chat? Well, I found out. The Shrenka do." His eyes hardened, "You know Shrenka? Mean bastards. They're genetically engineered Hunter-Killers. Genetic engineering's answer to the Model
66, which were a little too hard to control. They're big, 6, 7 feet tall, no hair, really long limbs. Real fast. A non-chipped guy like me didn't even have a chance." He drew the knife. It was unusual, the handle forming a T with the blade, so it stuck out between his fingers like a single steel claw. "The first one stabbed me with this. Right in
the gut, sliced my spinal cord in half. I was all set to die, but I had one more card to play. A little home-made weapon. Don't have it on me now--it's not really safe. But it killed the first Shrenka, while the other made off with my bag. Ratz got a hold of my company, and they took care of me." He paused, staring into space, "Or at least halfway, anyway. They fixed my guts. Apparently spinal injuries aren't life threatening. So they left me in a chair in a Venezuelan clinic. I came back here, started out on the slow road to my grave-- no corp, no experience on the streets. Ironic who saved me. Apparently GalletoCo was doing some engineering on a biotech project for Peterson Pharmalogicals. They made me an offer: Be a test subject for their new prosthetic spine. Do a job for them and I get to keep it. The job was to kill the guy who sent the Shrenka after me," he smiled fiercely, "How could I refuse? The spine works great...in me. Apparently about 1/3 of the test subjects are just incompatible with it, so they never marketed it. It was meant as a combat prosthesis - it smoothes your nerve impulses, and quickens them. Lets me react quicker, takes away some of my natural clumsiness," he shrugged, "I'm not a fighter, never will be, but I'm better off in a fight now than I was before." He pulled a slip of paper out of a pocket and wrote a net address on it. "Wanna know more, consult your local library," he said, handing her the paper. "Nowadays I do freelance. Some corporate work, some shadow work. It pays the bills. You got something you want done? I can mod pre-existing stuff, or I can build something from scratch." He took another pull off his beer, "So that's my story. What's yours?" he asked, eyeing the flight-suit.</p>

<p>Rune spun one of the chairs at his table around, to face her. "No need to stand," he commented.</p>

<p>Carefully she positioned it so she could watch most of the room and then she sat down. "Mine is somewhat long. I would first like to ask a small bit of aid. I have arrived here from a place VERY far away and thus I have no Ident Card, or whatever it is called here, and no standard credit, money, exchange device, medium, again whatever the standard is. What is considered exchangeable items here for buying a drink? I have a few stamped pieces of various metals, and some polished mineral objects, if those work?" She paused for a moment, then continued, "What sort of Ident stuff am I required to have in this domain?"</p>

<p>"Well, ident stuff, huh? In the arcology sector, you need some pretty heavy ID. Depends on who you work for." He slid up one sleeve to reveal a tiny scar, "GalCo implanted me with a chip. Hit it with microwaves and it wakes up, makes a low frequency signal of its own that GalCo used to ident me. It's nice because it's completely passive--you don't have to get it yanked every few years to get a power source replaced. Of course, they yanked it out of me when they dumped me. Didn't care much about cosmetics, so they left a scar, the fuckers. Round here, though. Chiba, the Chat, etc, you are who you say you are. Nobody looks at you too hard--that's a great way to get into trouble down here. As for money, that depends on where you are, too. Corp-types like credit. It's all
handled electronically, they just carry cred-sticks to make transfers. We use credit and cred-sticks here, too, but we also use nuyen." Rune fished one out of his pocket and placed it on the table, smoothing the paper carefully, "Now a nuyen is worth a little more than a credit, there are only so many of these floating around out there, and they're completely untraceable. Ideal for characters like us, so you might have to give a little extra cred to get the nuyen you want. The metal and such will work, but not directly," Rune replied, "Ask Ratz about a decent jeweler--one who won't rob you completely blind. He ought to know somebody.&quot; Looking at her Rune gave a small mental shrug, pushed the nuyen across the table. "You want a drink, take that. It'll buy you a couple, if your tastes aren't too exotic."</p>

<p>She picked up the paper money and studied it carefully before looking toward the bar. "You want anything?"</p>

<p>"Nah. You can pay that back when you can."</p>

<p>Snow stood and moved quickly to the bar, ordered two fingers of Bombay Sapphire gin and a Guinness.</p>

<p>She took a sip of gin, then a pull from the beer, thought a moment and began, "I come from a world named Aristaleez Prime, an odd mix of university planet and backword pit in the COre Sectors. At this point I couldn’t tell you where or when that is in relation to where we are right now." Once again she paused to consider how best to proceed. "I fear this could be very long - how would you like to hear it? I can try to do the reader’s digest condensed version, or go with the long form... Or..." A lopsided grin crossed her face, "I can do the really short form, which is only a few steps up from - I was born, I grew up, I aged, then I approached death."</p>

<p>He grinned back and replied, "How about a bit more than that?"</p>

<p>Her eyes unfocused for a minute, then she began. "The short form of my life - on Aristaleez Prime I escaped from an abusive father, masqueraded as my dead best friend, had half my brain replaced with a cyberware implant when an enemy of my best friend tried to kill me, joined the Alliance Security Service, prevented a planet-wide riot, became disillusioned with the Security Service, clawed my way up the political ladder using the training from the Security Service, became premiere, was deposed by my security chief, fled on a space freighter with a woman who later became a good friend - and then it started to get weird. Our ship suffered a hyperdrive malfunction and threw us out in another space-time where technology was a thing of the past and magic was the order of the day. Our ship was destroyed and a powerful sorceress bound us into an artifact of her design, then tossed us back into the realm between ‘real’ dimensions. We’ve been bouncing around for a while now..." Her gaze settled on Rune as she finished her drink. "It has been a long, weird ride. I’m not sure I believe it all, and I lived through it."</p>

<p>Rune listened to the story of her life with growing disbelief, then looked down at the table, swishing his beer around in its glass. Like the Odyssey he thought. Quietly he murmured, </p>

<p>"'Vexed the dim sea. </p>

<p>I am become a name </p>

<p>For always roaming with a hungry heart</p>

<p>Much I have seen and known--cities of men</p>

<p>And manners, climates, councils, governments...'" Rune recited, glancing at her flight suit, decision suddenly made. "I believe you. You definitely aren't Local...and neither is _that_," he said, pointing to the patch on her flight suit. A patch with writing that no one on earth had ever seen before.</p>

<p>She glanced at the worn patch which showed a cat leaping from a skull. "Ah, I hadn't noticed that yet... the writing says 'Ghost Wind'. Anyway, before the hyperdrive problems we were trying to fight back against the coup, and the creatures that had been released to help with it. There is a race of beings whose only purpose is to enslave and consume anything in their path that is not them. We are valuable as food or slaves, nothing more. As part of the coup they were released from their containment zone." Her gaze focused on the distance for a while, "Much later, after a bounce into the distant future of my time, I found out the resistance was only marginally successful. They dispersed enough of us that the Razaks never did manage to wipe out the other races, but the multi-planet alliance didn't survive either. Most worlds returned to being alone." She looked down at the flight suit again, "This became my favorite style of clothing on the star freighter. I've not found anything better since..."</p>

<p>"You might want to add a little body armor," he said, opening his much-abused leather jacket to show the bullet-proof lining, "This zips out to make a light vest. It's a rough neighborhood. So you're here. Now what?" Rune asked, looking at her over the rim of his glass as he took a long pull off his beer.</p>

<p>SnowDancer started to reply when the door opened again and a man stepped in. At first there was nothing remarkable about him until he stood by the door a fraction too long. Then he moved with a slight oddness of gait toward the bar. He must have ordered something to drink because in a few moments Ratz had pushed a drink to him. Once he sat down the oddness disappeared and eyes turned back to previous points of interest. Just as Snow again began to speak he made a rasping, whistling sound, convulsed and collapsed to the floor. Within moments one of the other patrons had moved to the fallen man, picked him up and headed out the door. "Does this happen often?"</p>

<p>"Probably one too many double blitzers absorbed at the grease pit just down the way. Or one too many modifications or implants. Seems to be an increasing problem of late."</p>

<p>Snow turned back to Rune, noticing as she did that a young woman had casually moved over to the area where he had fallen and picked up something, then moved back to a booth in the back. For a moment their eyes met and she saw something, an innocence under the hardness perhaps, that reminded her of herself a very long time ago. She filed it away for
later thought as she framed a reply, "A couple of things first, I guess...Sell enough stuff to get some armor and weapons, then I need to find someone good with cyberware implants. The device we are bound to protects us well enough but Shan says we aren't safe from entropy at some level. There are parts of my systems that aren't working as well as they used to and I need to have them worked on. There are some upgrades I would like to add also. And then we need replacement parts for our device, it is suffering similar problems"</p>
</br>

<p>PROCESS - SpawnNewThread( Ref=Maelyn )</p>

<p>I was sitting in the corner when I saw it. There, under the high bar stool where the funny man with the scary eyes had fallen. Small and black like a perfectly polished piece of charcoal. Seemed no one had noticed it but me, so I just went over and picked it up. Just like that. The Chat junkies probably just thought I was picking up another stray penny. I do that a lot. Only this time a stranger woman noticed me. For a second our eyes met and something flashed. Her eyes really saw things, not just the cursory search for weapons but the look of someone probing your soul.</p>

<p>I always sit alone, so privacy wasn't a problem. Not that I like sitting alone, I just don't think anybody really understands me here. They all kind of wander around wallowing in their cheap drinks listening to the metal whirring around under their skin, trying really really hard not to look happy. At least it seems that way. Like someone painted everything black. What was that saying I found in that old book? Something about painting everything black in the present so the future looks brighter. Whoever wrote that ditty would love this place.</p>

<p>So I took the pebble back to my crummy little torn up booth at the back, y'know, the one where one of Lonny's girl went meltdown when he dropped her. What a mess. Anyway, the pebble was all metal and smooth, with sort of a blue glaze. When I flipped it over it had some threads still stuck to a tiny cuff clasp. They were white and wispy, but looked like they'd been torn from something pretty expensive. I don't know why they seem so clear to me now, 'cause all I did was pick them off and toss them under the table.</p>

<p>The clasp is what really caught me. Y'see, I'm one of the trashy ones who hacks around the torn out old malls and such looking for the old twentieth century computer leftovers. Most of it got sick and died when the big 2K bug stung it, but I still manage to find a couple of old hard drives and neat little things stashed away in the old chips. What I'm saying is, I know old stuff. The little jacks on the clasp, which nobody probably noticed, made it pretty clear that the whole thing was "old stuff". They were like the ones one the old CPUs before the corps. took over and made everything their way or no way.</p>

<p>So, into the pocket it went. I figured I'd take it home and plug it into Katy. She'd know what it was, and if she didn't at least she'd learn something. I wasn't in a hurry, and right then I didn't really have the patience to be holding Katy's hand while she figured things out (she's like a kid sometimes), so I just sat back with drink in hand and listened. The Blue Monday in my palm was cool. It was another drink I'd brought Ratz from one of the old books I'd found.</p>

<p>I thought maybe things would pick up and Mr. Shivers would come back safe and sound for his little sparkly pebble, so I decided to wait around a bit. Besides, there was a real cutie down at the bar I'd never seen before who had taken an interest when I picked up the thing. I figured if I was lucky I wouldn't be going home lonely. Katy could wait.</p>

<p>I just wish I'd been smart enough that night to remember cute guys are so much trouble.</p>

<p>Oh, this one was a real doll face. He had the knock-em-sock-em all natural puppy brown eyes, and the smooth curve of a nice long highway I knew outside of town. Seemed he was into the Neo-Celt thing, since his arms and neck were decorated with that funky black knotty stuff. I usually hate tattoos, but on this guy they just snaked and slithered in all the right places.</p>

<p>His staring made me a bit uncomfortable. No one stares at me here. Well, Lonny used to stare, but he doesn't count. He was just shopping, but this guy could've burned holes through my head. Really hypnotic-like and sort of soothing. I don't even really remember him getting up and coming over.</p>

<p>"I know it's overused and kind of shallow, but buy you a drink?" Melting time. This guy's voice was hot. I think I even got shivers.</p>

<p>I did the stupid little flattered girl giggle. Embarrassing, but I really didn't know what else to say. I think I managed to blurt out "Blue Monday" when the look of waiting confusion started to show on him.</p>

<p>Everything about him was set. Chiseled from marble like that David guy over in Europe. Well, David meets Chiba, anyway. Six feet of cuts and ripples, five o'clock shadow and olive skin with a voice of melting iron and crewed ash hair. No implants, no wet outlets, all skin sinewy muscle. And he was talking to me. Wow.</p>

<p>"Got a name?"</p>

<p>"Maelyn". My voice sounded squeaky in my ears, but I guess everyone gets that in situations like this, right? Geez, was my heart beating fast. I was almost worried he'd hear it. I said something just to cover the sound. "Have a seat?" For some reason I almost expected him to say no, but he sat. I was stuck now. I really didn't know what to say. It really didn't help matters that he was looking down at my chest. I'm sure
my face must've been ten thousand shades of red.</p>

<p>"That's a neat little pendant you've got there," Okay, so it wasn't my tits "What is it?" For a second I wasn't sure whether to be relieved or have a bruised ego. I think I decided on a bit of both.</p>

<p>I absently reached down and ran my fingers over the smooth black square hanging on my neck. "It's an old chip. I found it on a twentieth century circuit board a couple of years ago in one of the Night Town scavenger shops." I think he could tell I was self-conscious. "So, what do they call you?"</p>

<p>"Depends who you are," he chuckled, giving me a weak-knees pearly white wry smile. "People here generally don't call me anything. I'm usually only ever in here on business".</p>

<p>My throat tightened a bit. "Business" in the Chat usually meant something bad, with lots of bullets and metal and blood. I guess I didn't notice that I started fidgeting with the pendant again or shifting around, but he sure did.</p>

<p>"Is something wrong?" His smile faded a bit, but not much. I had a brief hormonal flash when I saw his lips to just lean forward and kiss him. I think I almost did, too. The dyed blue stripe in my bangs fell into my face, telling me that I had actually leaned forward a bit. Blush time again. I was sure by now he thought I was an absolute flake. He had that kind of absent questioning look on his eyebrow.</p>

<p>I searched around in the muck of my brain for something non-committal and vague to say, but the most I think I managed was a rather labored sounding "No, no...not at all," accompanied by a cheesy smile. He leaned back and sighed, still smiling. I felt a little more comfortable. "So, if you only come here on business, why are you here now?"</p>

<p>He looked at me for a really long time. Of course, it was probably only a few seconds, but at lest it was enough time for me to see how his shirt stretched across his chest and stomach. I remember it was white, and that I was slightly embarrassed that I could see the darkness of his nipples under the light fabric. Yum.</p>

<p>"The cufflink you picked up back there at the bar. I've been looking for it." The ease of his matter-of-fact tone told me he wasn't going to ask for it back. I was either me giving it or him taking it. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a little round polished semi-sphere.</p>

<p>"This thing?" I held it up under the light, absently watching how the surface reflecting the halogen over the table. It reflected both of us in a warped dark way, like the old scary mirrors in the funhouses Mom used to take me to when I was a little girl back home. "You can have it. I just thought it looked kinda cool, y'know. But if it's yours..." I handed it over to him, and his reaction sort of reminded me of the Cheshire Cat I read about in that Alice book. Like he knew something no one else did.</p>

<p>"Thanks. You've made my job a whole lot easier." The smile he gave me almost gave off heat, it was so warm. Somehow I wasn't surprised that he began to get up. He may have had a nice butt, but he was still a bastard, what with leading a girl on like that. "I've got to get going. This little thing is paying my bills, and it's time to get it cashed in with the boss." Surprise, surprise.</p>

<p>I tried to be nice about it, but I don't think I came off too well. "Wouldn't want ya to starve." I noticed his smile starting to grow kind of thin, so I cut my losses. "Nice meeting you...uhh...," it occurred to me that he never did say his name. I hung on my words looking rather stupid.</p>

<p>"Tom," he replied with another one of his chuckles. They were beginning to sound a little fake. Maybe I was just bitter.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the drink, Tom. Take care of yerself." I deliberately added a bit of venom, but I doubt he noticed. He was already heading for the door. I don't know why, but the whole thing left me feeling spotlighted. Sort of like everyone was watching me. Of course, no one was. No one ever did. I was just that-flakey-chick-in-the-corner here. Except the stranger woman. Her eyes had flicked over at Tom's sudden departure. Again it seemed as if she had read the whole situation. And Ratz, he was the only one who ever smiled when I came in. Probably because I was always bringing him the old drink mixes I dug up.</p>

<p>When he left, I reached back into my pocket and fiddled around in the old gum wrappers and odds n' ends, finally picking out the little clasp of the sparkly blue-glazed pebble. I held it out in my palm, slowly turning it over, watching how it caught the light. Just like the old chip I'd handed dear old Tom. Lucky I was down in Night Town earlier scavenging. Like I said, nobody knows "old stuff" like me. Tom probably
wouldn't know he'd been handed a fake until he tried to cash it in with the "boss". I might be flakey, but I'm not stupid. Besides, revenge is better than Christmas.</p>

<p>It was creepy when I thought about it. How had Tom known I was going to pick up the sparkly and how had he known Mr. Shivers was coming here?</p>

<p>Then there was the Stranger Woman. I turned to look at her once again and found that she was pointing my way and talking to another stranger.</p>

<p>Suddenly unnerved I downed the last of the Blue Monday in two gulps. It kinda burned, but I was in a hurry to get away from all the sudden attention. I also wanted to get this thing plugged into Katy and see what she made of it. It was obviously a chip of some kind, and apparently worth a lot of money. Maybe going home alone tonight wouldn't be such a big deal...</p>

<p>PROCESS - SwapThread( Ref=Maelyn -> Ref=SnowDancer )</p>

<p>Peripheral movement caught SnowDancer’s eye and she glanced up in time to see a predator in fancy dress close in on the girl in the corner. She watched the interchange long enough to see the girl holding her own then turned back to Rune. There was a whisper of cloth from the back and the predator left abruptly with a satisfied smile. Another glance at the girl told her that he was going to be disappointed. Again ghost-echoes of her long lost past pulled at her. 'I really shouldn't get involved in this...' She thought to herself as she directed a message through the comm, "Tyana, please have Shandi come to the Chatsubo, stat."</p>

<p>The sound of the door opening again brought SnowDancer and Rune’s attentions back its way. They saw a rail thin woman with wavy auburn hair glide in. Her pixyish face wore a vacant little half smile, but her eyes looked like doors into the pits of hell. Moving with a swift cat-like grace she glided over to the table where they were seated. She leaned close to SnowDancer's ear and spoke softly. Her broken, jerky voice was just audible to Rune. "Here now. Want?" Her words emerged stilted and bitten off, as if her voice was seldom used. For a few moments her face held a look of presence while she spoke, then lapsed back into the vacant half smile when she was finished.</p>

<p>SnowDancer quietly replied, "The girl over at that table," Snow gestured and Shandi's eyes tracked over breifly. "Make sure she gets to where she is going once she leaves."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Snow looked at her, startled, "I don't know why. She reminds me of someone I knew a very long time ago. A predatory type just left after trying to get something from her. She still has it and I think he might try for it again. I believe I heard her say her name was Maelyn. And Shan, don't attract attention, we don't know the rules here yet."</p>

<p>"OK," Shan replied in a light, little girl kind of voice. She pulled a chair from the table and sprawled into it. Her face relaxed back into a vacant stare with only her eyes alert. Every so often she would glance back at her assignment then return to aimlessly watching the rest of the bar. When her target slammed the last of her drink and stood Shan pulled a small vial from a side pocket of her jeans and downed it. The aroma of extremely strong coffee and mint drifted briefly past the table. She then rose and glided back out the door a few seconds after the girl.</p>
</br>

<p>PROCESS - SpawnNewThread( Ref=Shan )</p>

<p>The woman named Shan paused outside the Chatsubo and made a quick scan of her surroundings. The girl Maelyn wasn't hard to spot. She was moving somewhat carefully down the street, but not with the level of paranoia some might have employed. As Shan moved the vacant look faded from her face, to be replaced with a grin of satisfaction. Her senses came alive as her danger sense swept the seemingly empty street for dangers to her target.</p>
</br>

<p>PROCESS - SwapThread( Ref=Shan -> Ref=SnowDancer )</p>

<p>Rune looked at Snow as Shan slipped back through the door. "Same Shan that mentioned entropy? Is she always that twitchy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Snow's look turned sad at the mention of Shan. "She is a puzzling one. We rescued her on one of the Fringe Worlds. We've been able to figure out she was used as a revenge object by a being called 'Aztol'. Seems Aztol had been inconvenienced by Shan's father and decided she would make the perfect revenge. Aztol captured her and hacked her biochemistry in some obscure ways. It seems like it involved combining one or more different DNA sequences with hers. She is the fastest being I have ever encountered, but it has warped her in many ways. She is only 'awake' or present when she is in a highly threatening situation, or if she's strung out on heavy stimulants. The Galaihan coffee is the absolute minimum that seems to work. Most times she functions as if she were totally brain dead. If you point her and tell her to do something, she will do it, as long as it isn't complicated at all. Even when she's wired up, she has serious trouble forming thoughts into words. She can do a bit better with signing. The weirdest part is she's a kick-ass sorceress, though. She says she can see the patterns of magic in things, and from what I've seen her do - I would have to agree."</p>

<p>Rune glanced at the clock behind Ratz, stood and sketched another bow to Snow, "Damn, how did it go so late? I need to get going, projects to work on and things to do. I hope to see you here again?"</p>

<p>Snow smiled in return, "I should try and track down some cash myself and check on my device. I'll be back though!" she trailed Rune as he headed toward the door, then broke off and approached the bar. "Excuse me, Ratz isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. May I help you?"</p>

<p>"I would like a shot of your best tequila, a slice of lime, and the name of a good money changer, jeweler, something like that... I am not certain of the local name for it. Someone who would be able to tell me the relative worth of various metals and mineral crystals I have, and then convert those to local..uh...nuyen?"</p>

<p>With quick efficiency he handed her the shot and lime then commented, "No legit business would touch your items unless you can prove clear ownership of them. Some gems and such are not hard, metals on the other hand...gold and silver especially, are only legal in a few specialized forms."</p>

<p>"Aren't there are others who might help?"</p>

<p>"I imagine there are, but I certainly wouldn't know of them. I am a legitimate business owner."</p>

<p>"Of course you are. You do have an interesting cross section of clientele though. Then there is the matter of the odd transactions I glimpsed that occur here. Why haven't you reported them to the proper authorities? This is a bar, people talk about all sorts of things. Perhaps you've accidentally over-heard something?"</p>

<p>After a long pause he replied, "Well, I have heard through the rumor mill that A'Brecht Loan and Pawn might bend some of the proof of ownership regs once in a while... He is said to be an unpleasant sort of person though. I wouldn't look to be treated nicely by him..." He provided detailed directions to the small store front A'Brecht used as she handed over a bit of the nuyen for the drink sweetened considerably for the information. Ratz favored her with a much warmer smile as she turned toward the door. If anyone was watching they would have seen her face harden to a predatory mask not unlike Shan's as she left the bar.</p>

<p>PROCESS - SwapThread( Ref=SnowDancer -> Ref=Maelyn )</p>

<p>It was kind of cool, I guess. The corps'. little runner being outwitted by a ten-year old magic trick, simple as pulling a coin from behind my ear. Everything was easy like that around here if you knew what you were doing. I guess that's why I've always had a thing for the old tech. Things get really powerful when no one remembers or knows what they do.</p>

<p>Take MFMs, the really old data storage drives people used back in the
nineteen-eighties. I found Katy in an MFM attached to the old Asus board Xackary tossed at me down at the shop. He had no way of getting into it, and neither did any of his boys. That's the key. All the spiders and subskin cracking implants, and none of them could get inside because MFMs were obsolete, and why would anyone want inside one these days anyway, right?</p>

<p>So they tossed it off on me. I guess they thought I'd just scrap it or use it for parts, which I eventually did, but I always check 'em first. I figure history's got a lot to teach. Never know where something like that comes from or what's in it. Nine times out of ten it's just old spreadsheets or school projects by people who were dead a long time when I was born, but sometimes I find something worth playing with.</p>

<p>The MFM Xackary gave me was gold. Judging by the biochemistry papers and lab reports, I guessed it belonged to either a university student or some researcher. Biology isn't my gig, so most of that went down the sewer. The only thing I found in the dusty old disk was a neat little self-sustaining prototype virus. Looked something like those old Conway Life Games, where the cells come and go and the community shifts and changes. It was called Katy.</p>

<p>Katy is still old technology, but she's the most advanced thing going. She thinks and learns in her way, but still mostly infantile stuff. Simple things get her, like sacrificing a piece in chess. She just doesn't get it yet. She reminds me of a kid in a lot of ways. She likes to explore and learn about everything. At least, I think she likes it. I haven't figured out if she can actually feel anything yet.</p>

<p>I guess Katy is what people call an AI, but she seems so much better. The AIs I've seen are just computers that analyze and anticipate, or process based on variables. Simple stuff. Katy does all that, but she's curious. She'd be the one to push a button just to see what happens, that kind of thing. I was counting on that response for the little sparkly I was bringing her...</p>

<p>I don't remember being hit. That'll teach me for daydreaming. All I remember is my left shoulder exploding when something came down on me. At least, it felt like an explosion. Probably just the impact, I guess I'm easy to sneak up on.</p>

<p>I floored face-down in a greasy puddle, but I'd managed to get my hands in front of me last minute to break the fall. Still, I lost my breath when I hit. I tried to roll and kick out like Xack had told me, but I think my foot just kind of flailed in the air. Bruce Lee I ain't, obviously. I tried to catch my heartbeat in the blur of overhead neon, but the stink of being so close to the asphalt made my head swim.</p>

<p>I was too disoriented to do anything more than open my eyes and stare stupidly at the big guy and his bitch standing over me. I just barely made out that he was demanding money over the ringing in my ears, but it still didn't register. The throbbing in my shoulder took most of my attention. It was all I could focus on to keep the darkness at the edge of my vision.</p>

<p>It wasn't enough. I'm not tough or armored like the others back there. The darkness fell over me like a blanket, real soothing. I'm guessing that's the point where I passed out...</p>
</br>

<p>PROCESS - SwapThread( Ref=Maelyn -> Ref=Shan )</p>

<p>Shan saw two shadows break away from a recessed doorway and close in on Maelyn. For a moment longer she watched to see if the girl would notice them or react at all. When she didn't, Shan made her move. The actions of the pair slowed as she rapidly closed with them. Half way there, Maelyn was going down from a punch to the shoulder and back. </p>

<p>Three-quarters there, Maelyn hit the pavement and the larger shadow moved to stand over her.</p>

<p>Arrival, the large shadow demanded money in a male sounding voice while the smaller, a woman, brought some type of pistol like object to bear on Maelyn.</p>

<p>Shan's left hand flashed out and closed on the weapon, twisting until she heard bones snap and the object come loose from the woman's grasp. The woman's gasp alerted the man and he began to turn. His momentum added to the already impressive speed of Shan's hand, as her diamond hard nails tore through his light neck armor as if it were paper. There was the skree of tearing metal followed by a wet gurgling tear as his throat came out in her hand. His blood splashed on her hand and into Maelyn's face, drawing a small moan from her.</p>

<p>Shan spun back to the woman and smiled, asking conversationally, "What you want my friend? You want to play?" the woman turned and ran. For a moment Shan almost pursued, until another groan brought her attention back to Maelyn. She twitched her arm, dropping a throwing star into her hand which she let fly. The running figure dropped soundlessly with it embedded in the back of her neck.</p>

<p>Even as the star flew toward it's target Shan was already crouching down to check on the girl. Finding no reason not to move her she picked her up and carried her into a dark alcove just a bit farther up the street. She quickly checked Maelyn over for serious damage and, finding none, settled back to watch and wait for her to regain consciousness. A quick trip back to the man provided her with cloth to clean most of the blood off herself and Maelyn. While she was there she emptied his pockets and found nothing.</p>

<p>Another quick check of Maelyn and then she moved to the other body. Swiftly she recovered her throwing star, then performed a quick but thorough search of the body. There was nothing on it either, except it appeared too well groomed to be a street thug. The clothes under the rough jacket were clean and in good repair. The woman herself was clean and well groomed. Her hands were not callused enough for physical labor and she appeared to have been in good health. </p>

<p>The exposed nature of their position kept her awake while she waited. She took a couple of moments to activate a link back to Tyana. "Shan. Gave Snow message. She told me back up woman Maelyn. There was trouble. I fine, Maelyn appears hit stun device. Tell Snow somethingnot right. There was attack players not what seemed. Call if need help. Waiting Maelyn wake up. Back soon..."</p>

<p>A few people passed by on the street, each one scanning the alcove. Every one of them gave it a wide berth. Finally Maelyn awoke. Gently Shan asked, "You have someplace safe? I help you get there if like... or take you my safe place."</p>
</br>

<p>PROCESS - LinkThreads( Ref=Shan, Ref=Maelym -> Ref=Maelyn )</p>

<p>I must've hit my chin on the street, because the first thing I remember was a slight taste of blood in my mouth. Followed, of course, by a throb up in my shoulder blade. I was almost afraid to move, just in case I'd had something broken back there. I hate pain. I briefly contemplated spending the rest of my life face down in a back alley just to avoid finding out.</p>

<p>Whoever nailed me seemed busy dealing with their own cup of tea, so I just played dead and hoped the ones beating on them had a soft spot for ditzy eighteen year old chicks kissing cement. I sort of opened my eyes once, but my head was still pounding so bad that my vision was still blurred and the ground seemed to spin off sideways. Did wonders for my stomach, let me tell you. I tried to relax, and just closed my eyes and reached down into my pocket.</p>

<p>It was still there. Mr. Shivers' little expensive sparkly pebble. It felt really smooth and cool against my fingers, giving me a brace to concentrate on so as to avoid doing anything stupid, like moving. I started to wonder how much trouble this stupid little chip was causing. Probably lots of trouble for Tom, at least. The thought didn't do much for me right then. Frankly, I think I was wishing he'd stuck around. He probably just would have shot me. At least it's quick and easy.</p>

<p>How much money was I holding in my fingertips right then? I couldn't have told you even if I had wanted to. It was just an old storage chip I'd found on the floor of the Chat, under some ragged barstool. Tom made it sound like the thing was a diamond. Didn't look like much, just another piece of silicon with a useless string of raw data, most likely. All pretty and polished up to look like a cufflink. I started to feel cold.</p>

<p>I rolled the cufflink over in my fingers a few times. I wondered what happened to the owner, that pale guy who passed out back in the Chat. I wondered if he even knew it was missing. And Tom, where was he? Had he passed off the fake I pawned him to his boss and gotten himself killed? I began feeling sick. How many people were after this thing? How many were after me?</p>

<p>My mind wandered back to the street when someone leaned over me. The muscles in my abdomen tightened up in anticipation of another kick, but nothing happened. The throb in my back still scared me out of moving, but I managed to crick my neck over a bit to the side, just to test the reaction. I half-expected to have my face beat in, but instead I heard a woman, almost politely, asking me where I was going.</p>

<p>I put my hands under me and tried to push up off the street, but the pain and ache were too much. I think she noticed, because she gently reached a hand under one arm and helped me up on the second go. I think I tried to seem tough, but it didn't come off too well I imagine. I nearly fell over when I tried to casually dust myself off, and she had to brace me up by the elbow.</p>

<p>I caught one body out of the corner of my eye, and turned to the blonde one. "Fancy. But why me? If you want the chip, you can bloody have it." I fished around in my pocket to pull it out...</p>

<p>Shan looked puzzled, "You ok? What chip? Asked protect you, favor friend. Nothing about chip...That what wanted?" Shan continued to scan the street as they talked. Several moving shapes across the street caught her attention. "Someone interested, best leave now. Otherwise trouble." Her face split into a happy smile at the though of more excitement. She positioned herself to be between Maelyn and the movement she'd seen, then helped her start moving in the direction she'd been going. "You call - you place, my place? Best decide soon." As she spoke she dropped a knife into her hand and Maelyn felt Shan's muscles tense slightly where Shan was steadying her. "I Shandi, Shan to friends. Friend SnowDancer ask protect you. You Maelyn?" Shan picked up the pace somewhat as she said quietly, "If attacked, drop, roll out of way. Don't be hero."</p>

<p>It wasn't too hard for me to tell she wasn't from around here, and it was becoming more obvious that she, or rather we, couldn't stay around here either. Two dead bodies and a couple of women covered in blood have the irritating habit of attracting the cops. One way ticket to deportation for little old me.</p>

<p>I turned to Shan, not quite sure if she was going to kill me too. She had that look like she was either going to hit me or pass out. Wound up tight, she was. I knew I didn't want her around my place or Katy. Of course, I wasn&#146;t sure if I should tell her to fuck off, either. Not generally wise to someone who's just committed a double homicide.</p>

<p>"Well, lead the way. We can talk once I can get this blood out of my eye." I think I managed a slight grin. It was the most difficult action ever accomplished in my lifetime, but I figured it had to be better than peeing my pants, which would have been a close second.</p>

<p>We continued down the street, Shan grinning in anticipation. At the next cross street the shadows turned up it and moved away. Shan's happy smile faded as they moved away. We moved quickly with Shan scanning the roads around us. It didn't take long to figure we were looping back to the Chat, coming up on it from a side street. We didn't quite go there, instead Shan took us down the alley and did something strange to a dumpster.</p>

<p>There was a click and then a side of it swung open. Next thing she's motioning me into it. I stopped and shook my head. She started in, then turned and motioned at me again saying, "Not hurt. Safe here. Clean up."</p>

<p>I hesitated longer, then shrugged and followed along. Today was probably going to be my last anyway the way it was going. As I stepped through there was a weird tingling that crawled across my skin. Kind of like a heavy security field or an antisnoop fuzz field.</p>

<p>Beyond the door it just got stranger. I was in a stone hallway that was too long to be inside a dumpster. At the far end was a curtain of intricate beadwork. From beyond it came the sounds of quiet conversation and the unmistakable sounds of eastern music. As soon as I was completely inside the door closed quietly behind me. As it clicked home all sound from outside disappeared. Shan, seeing my panic tried to explain, "Not locked. Not like distractions. Come meet others." She slipped through the curtain and waited for me to follow her.</p>

<p>Completely numb now I followed her through the curtain into an impossible room. The room was a series of seven long alcoves branching from a central court. Each alcove was two levels high and filled with real paper books. The kind I used to find in mouldy, soggy piles in the burned out places. Here they were like new, dry and perfect, each sitting in a place on a shelf just waiting to be read.</p>

<p>In the court a sculpture of large, twined snakes of some kind, cobras I think they might have been, spat water into a waiting pool. Near it was a small bench with two women sitting and talking. Shan led the way closer and pointed to the brown haired younger one. "Lynn, techno." Then she pointed to the other one. She was taller and thin, with dark skin and black hair. Her eyes were in constant motion, watching everything, yet she seemed relaxed. "Krystyl, warrior."</p>

<p>Lynn looked up and smiled, "I bet you wonder what is going on here. This is a transdimensional construct, meaning it is a constructed pocket reality linked to ‘real space’ through the interface you entered through. Right now the interface looks like one of those metal containers. Anyway, we are here to acquire repair parts and systems. V..ah...SnowDancer asked us to provide you with a safe place. I expect she'll explain more once she gets back, although you are free to leave any time if you feel trapped or uncomfortable. Snow wanted to make sure you were safe. Shan will show you where you can clean up."</p>

<p>Shan motioned me down the next wing to the left of where we had entered. Beyond the curtain was another short corridor ending in a heavy oak door. The door opened to an enormous bathroom and washing area. "Join when done." She said as she walked back out of the room.</p>

<p>It was too much. I collapsed to the floor and began to quietly cry. "Oh great Mae, when the going gets tough, the tough cry." Angry with myself I dashed the tears out of my eyes and tried to figure out what to do. I was in a dumpster behind the Chat. That prompted near hysterical giggles. I had a chip that someone wanted back very badly. There were strangers in town who were even more strange than the regulars and they wanted... My thoughts trailed away at that. I had no idea what they wanted or why they had seemed to help me.</p>

<p>Outside, in the parking area for the Chatsubo, SnowDancer stood for a few moments. The night sounds and smells washed over her. Signs flashed in the distance, lighted windows painted pictures on the surrounding buildings and the scents of burned fuels drifted on the slight damp breeze. She allowed her senses to shift slightly, then waited while her systems identified background electrical sources. After a glance back at the Chatsubo she moved down the street in the direction of A'Brecht's shop.</p>

<p>She moved with purpose, relying on her attitude to carry her through. Unfamiliar sounds kept her adrenaline cranked up high, yet she held herself as if she hadn't a worry in the world. A couple of times she passed others going about their own business. A couple of them had slowed to check her out until she smiled a cold, predatory smile at them. Then they kept right on moving.</p>

<p>A few streets down and one over brought her to the inset front of the shop. Iron grillwork separated the windows from the street and a heavy ornate ironwork outer door stood open, but ready to be closed if needed. As Snow approached the building she saw the entry was alive with sensors and scanning equipment, just waiting to reveal a visitor's every detail to those already within. </p>

<p>PROCESS - SpawnNewThread( Ref=Tom )</p>

<p>When he looked back into the mists in his head, he could point out the critical mistake plain as day. Still, he didn't like killing, especially when it had to be stupid teenage chicks who probably didn't know any better. He had been too anxious to retire and escape with Derek. The fantasy was so strong he made a mistake, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Of course, he deserved getting killed for it. Another life, another set of problems, another identity, poor Derek. They'd have to move again before anyone took a good look at the recovered tissue samples in the clone tanks and saw the Tleiran-12 nanites. Running away, all over again. Some days it seemed like this was their last chance on Earth. Nowhere left to go.</p>

<p>It hurt Tom to see that look in Derek's eyes when the time came to run again. The hurt in the big blues made him want to reach out and protect Derek from the world, and from himself. Love was strong, but it couldn't make someone follow a dead end forever. Things were seeming more like dead ends every day. Maybe he should've just left without Derek back in Canada; left him with the friends he'd made at the medical academy. It wasn't his war. Tom had to stop as the tears welled up in his eyes. Derek had to be happy, but the selfishness of being alone...</p>

<p>He had to get back and start the move. People would be coming soon, crawling up from the gutters of past involvements to reclaim their guinea pig. His hand fumbled lightly over the catch of the Necrox heavy pistol on his thigh. He was nervous out in the street, especially so messed up from the fall. Most people don't walk away from a thirty five story drop, and those that might look damn bad afterwards.</p>

<p>He needed to get back. Laewyn had already put him out the Zerius window for retrieving the bad chip, but it wasn't Lae he was worried about. Zerius probably assumed he was dead, but it wasn't them he worried about. The others would know he was still alive, and would pick up the scent soon.</p>

<p>Time to run again.</p>

<p>SnowDancer waited in front of the shop for almost an hour, watching the electronic patterns change whenever someone went in. Without knowing what they were carrying and concealing it told her little about the abilities and mechanisms of the sensors. Finally she decided to mask everything and let A'Brecht, or whomever, make what they would of her masked self. She began moving toward the door, then thought again and remembered the warnings she's gotten at the Chatsubo about armor and weapons. With a twisted little smile she stepped back into the shadows and keyed her comm. "Tyana, could you ask Shan to join me? If she's back yet?"</p>

<p>Tyana's voice came back, sounding somewhat distracted, "She got in a little while ago. I'll send her right over." Snow relayed the street location where she was and then leaned back against the cold stone wall to wait.</p>

<p>"There soon. What up?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to exchange some currency and figured I might need some assistance. We'll be masked so they'll probably think us easy marks. Be ready."</p>

<p>"We party!"</p>

<p>As soon as Shan arrived they stepped out across the street and into the sensor field. Concentrating to the point of almost stumbling, Snow held the sensor field absolutely still as they walked into the shop. Once inside she was able to slack her concentration slightly.</p>

<p>A tall scrawny man looked them up and down as they entered, then said, "A little far from the safety of the enclaves aren't you?"</p>

<p>Snow smiled sweetly at him and answered, "Whatever. You came recommended as someone who could handle discreet cash trades. Is that true?" Shan's eyes roamed the small shop, taking in the heavy wire cage between the man and them. Knives gleamed bright behind a reinforced counter. Guns and launchers of various forms hung from every exposed surface. A small clothes rack to the left held various sets of body armor.</p>
</br>

<p>PROCESS - SwapThread( Ref=SnowDancer -> Ref=Rune )</p>

<p>Somewhere in one of the rooming houses near the Chatsubo Rune straightened from his notebook with a slow smile. A quick twist of his head and his neck cracked audibly, releasing all the tension at once.</p>

<p>"No shit," he said, presumably to the notebook, "it's done." He drank the last dregs of his coffee from a battered old mug. Cold and disgusting, but it drove some of his fatigue away. Right then a smart guy would go get some sleep, but Rune was in the mood to celebrate, fatigue and all. With a final grin he punched the codes to start the little automatic fab-line tucked off against the far wall of the apartment. A few moments later it began building out the first run of the custom chip he just finished.</p>

<p>The walk to the Chat helped clear his head as the cool night air swirled around him. Ratz looked up as he settled at the bar. "Ah, herr Rune, what might I get for you?"</p>

<p>"Black and Tan, Ratz, and do it the right way," Rune replied, flipping a few nuyen onto the bar.</p>

<p>Nodding, Ratz put a pint glass on the bar and began rummaging around behind the bar for a spoon, "So what is the special occasion, herr Rune?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I just finished a long project. Designed an encryption algorithm for digital communications, called Aegis. Then I designed a chip to implement it--mayDAE. The little automatic fab-line in my apartment is fabbing the first run as we speak. Time for the victory dance."</p>

<p>By now Ratz had the Harp in the bottom of the glass, and was deftly holding the spoon and glass with one hand while pouring the Guinness with the other. When all was done Ratz put the glass on the bar, swept up Rune's nuyen, and was off to deal with another customer.</p>

<p>Rune looked at the drink for a minute, filled with the same goofy childlike wonder as the first time he'd had one, at the half pint of Guinness floating on top of a half pint of Harp. Shaking his head at his own silliness, he took a long, cool pull off the drink, turned to face the bar. The Guinness reminded him of SnowDancer. Now she was the real cipher he had to figure out. Definitely not Local. But being from off world meant some kind of hyperdrive, at least. Rumor had it Ramer Batzel was doing some kind of space-folding research for Ronin DigiTronics in Kyoto, but it was just rumor. Was it possible? If it was, it had the potential to knock the whole world on its ass and start making things _right_ again. Space travel. Childhood dreams fought toward the surface of his mind. He pushed them back away as he scanned the bar, noticing that SnowDancer was no where to be seen. It took a few long moments to get Ratz to reveal where he had sent her off to.</p>

<p>Rune slammed the last of his Black and Tan and headed out the door toward A'Brecht's shop. His good mood had evaporated as quickly as it had arrived. If he wasn't careful he was going to leave another friend in the lurch, just like he had all too often before. A'Brecht. Rune didn't know the man, even by reputation, not dealing with such things, himself. He hurried down street after street, hoping to catch Snow before she met the
shopkeeper. </p>

<p>He was too late, he realized. Snow and the other woman, Shan he thought he'd remembered she'd said, were already inside, talking to a man--presumably A'Brecht. He pushed the door open, ignoring the sensor packs crudely taped to the frame. Nothing short of a full medical scan would detect his spine, and no-one would worry at his old Colt until they saw him use it.</p>

<p>"Hullo ladies, how's it goin'?"</p>

<p>Snow glanced back as the man's eyes swiveled back to the door. She grinned and sketched a slight bow to the figure entering. "Heya!" Over the comm link she said to Shan, "This is Rune, a friend from the Chatsubo."</p>

<p>Shan turned slightly, sketched a small bow of her own and said, "Saw bar. Pleased."</p>

<p>The man stared at her a moment, then turned back to Snow. "What is this, a fucking convention?"</p>

<p>"So, manners are extra then?" Snow fired back coolly.</p>

<p>"Fuck it, enclaver. You come here slummin' what you expect? Someone to wipe your ass? You gonna trade or no?" He spit out of a face gone cold.</p>

<p>"Trade it is. How much nuyen for these?" Snow produced a small pile of gold necklaces and bracelets with various gemstones attached.</p>

<p>"Momma's jewelry? 50." Snow silently added another small hand-full to the pile. "75."</p>

<p>"We seem to have a difference of opinion here." She turned to Rune and asked, "Excuse me sir, what do you think these gold and emerald 'trinkets' should fetch? I believe this ... being? ... is attempting to cheat me." She shot him a conspiratorial wink that was not visible to the man behind the counter. Once more on her comm channel she asked, "Tyana, can you get anything about a place/person named A'Brecht? I need it stat."</p>

<p>"Cripes," Rune said, looking down at the pile and trying to hide his
surprise, "If those aren't stolen, lady, the Finn'll give you ten times that for 'em. Maybe more," he muttered, looking at a particularly splendid silver ring, set with a starred sapphire. His eyes refocused then, looking through the glass counter, around the cheap chinese knockoff guns, to spot A'Brecht's clenched fists. </p>

<p>Snow grinned back at Rune, "Kind of what I thought...metals and stones usually have value, at least in most of the places I've been. And no, they are not stolen." She turned a very cold gaze back at A'Brecht.</p>

<p>"What, you think because she's a 'burber she's stupid?" Rune felt a vague unease. That was exactly what A'Brecht thought. Snow had given him a situation that looked like a major score, and Rune was stealing it away. Blood had been shed for far less in Chiba.</p>

<p>Shan had never taken her eyes off A'Brecht who was starting to look really twitchy with this many people in the shop. He spoke, "Fucking party..." hoping to mask his subtle shift toward a place under the counter.</p>

<p>Rune tensed, his left hand drifting out of his pocket, ready to grab his Colt from his shoulder holster, if need be. Belatedly, he remembered that it was in "condition 3", with the hammer down, and nothing in the pipe. He would be hopelessly late if things got rough.</p>

<p>Abruptly A'Brecht stopped, drawing attention back to himself as he saw Shan grin with pleasure. "Go ahead... WANT party!"</p>

<p>Rune couldn't stop his slow grin at that. There was something truly disturbing about a slip of a girl like Shan begging for a fight. Let A'brecht chew on that.</p>

<p>Once again A'Brecht assessed the situation in front of him and slumped slightly. With a muttered, "Crazy bitch," he turned back to Snow. "Ok, I'll give you 800 nuyen for the stack on the counter."</p>

<p>Snow looked at him, then at Rune. When she saw his brief nod she said,
"Done." She took the nuyen from A'Brecht and tucked it into one of the many pockets on her flight suit. Then she continued in a conversational tone, "You blew it, you know. I expected to be cheated when I came in here. BUT I didn't expect to be slapped in the face by it. Nor did I expect to be continually insulted. If you had offered a reasonable sum, I would have come back often when I needed quick cash. Always it's the little thugs that try and put the squeeze on. As it is, I think I'll try Finn. Oh, and I HAD been thinking about trading for some weapons and armor...but you lost that too."</p>

<p>Goaded and stung anger and confusion crawled across A'Brecht's face. For a moment Snow looked him up and down as if he were some interesting, but disgusting item. So quietly only A'Brecht could barely hear her she added, "Come on, make a play..." through a smile as predatory as Shan's. She waited a beat and then turned her back to him.</p>

<p>Her smile had turned warm by the time she was facing Rune. "I think a drink would be delightful - I'd like to wash the taste of this place out of my mouth."</p>

<p>Rune snapped his attention back around to Snow, "Yeah, I know. Tastes tangy, like...sweat, or fear or something." He couldn't help but rub A'Brecht's face in it a little.</p>

<p>Shan's triumphant, "Yessss!" snapped Snow back around in time to see A'Brecht drop the weapon he had grabbed. Rune spun at the same time, Colt in hand, and snapped the old iron sights into perfect alignment with A'Brecht's heart, but the shopkeeper was already pacified, backing away from his dropped piece. Defeated, he slumped against his counter as one by one they filed out into the night.</p>

<p>Shan's disappointed voice was the last thing A'Brecht heard as the door closed on his shop. "Wanted party."</p>

</br>

<p>PROCESS - SwapThread( Ref=SnowDancer -> Ref=Maelyn )</p>

<p>Water dripped in my face. In the distance more drips fell and echoed hollowly. I was lieing alone on cold stone. Though closed, my eyes pulsed with a dull soreness that told me both had been badly bruised. The old copper smell of blood told me my eyes weren't the only thing bruised. What had happened?</p>

<p>Moving my hands I felt my surroundings. Sewer slime and a plasteel grate next to my head greeted my roaming fingers. I shifted my hands down near my sides and pressed lightly on the floor. Instantly a wave of sharp pain shot up through the muscles and tendon of my right forearm. A tiny moan broke the near-silence as I slumped back to the ground, panting. Three white-hot pokers played in the flesh of my arm, bringing tears to my eyes.</p>

<p>Carefully I rolled over and splashed into the cold water in the center of the pipe. I eased open my swollen eyelids. The sewer corridor was dim, but I could make out a badly rusted manhole above me letting in yellowish light. The cold water running across my back felt wonderful as long as I didn't think about what it was.</p>

<p>After several minutes of absorbing the heavy acid smells and coolness of the water I managed to lift my right arm to where I could see it. The skin around my wetjack was reddish purple and swollen. Yellowish puss oozed from the edges of the jack and just holding it up to look at it sent waves of pain running up and down the bone like electrical current. It looked as though someone had ripped a node right out of my arm and left the result to rot. I let it fall back into the cool water.</p>

<p>How did I get here? I remembered two strange women and a dumpster. Auburn hair and fighting. That was the last thing. Blood, yes. Someone had been fighting...fighting over...what? Katy. It had something to do with Katy and...a chip! I felt down into my pocket for the glossed black chip I'd picked up back at the Chat. Gone. Had I managed to hide it with the auburn hair woman, or had the men gotten it. I couldn’t remember.</p>

<p>I hauled myself up to a sitting position, and hooked my left hand around my knees to prevent losing balance and falling backwards. Then I took another look at the input hardpoint on my arm. The hardware was still intact, which mean that the data storage cube was still there. A grin passed flickered across my face. I had rememberd the first lesson with computers, always make a backup in case something bad happened. Whoever had attacked me might have gotten the chip, but I still had the backup.</p>
</br>

<p>PROCESS - SwapThread( Ref=Maelyn -> Ref=SnowDancer )</p>

<p>Laughing and talking to relieve some of the tension they threaded their way back to the Chatsubo. Once inside they settled back into a corner table with a round of drinks.</p>

<p>Rune feeling the need to make formal introductions turned to Shan and said, "Shan?" He extended a handshake, "I'm Rune. Custom electronics designer - anything non-implants, my biology just ain't strong enough."</p>

<p>"Shan. Fighter, Arcane." Her hand slowly moved to a pocket while she spoke. "No worry, not harmful" It re-emerged with a small ampoule of a dark liquid. With practiced ease she snapped the top off and downed the contents.</p>

<p>He took a long pull off a dark Guinness before continuing, "So you never told me, Snow, you here to stay, or just passing through? The whole world isn't as bad as A'Brecht, though most of them are close."</p>

<p>"There are those like A'Brecht everywhere. There was a time when I was no better. My plans are uncertain for now. I am in need of various electronic and cybernetic parts and pieces, but they will need to interface to some really strange things. I don't know where to start tracking them down." She paused thoughtfully and continued in a much quieter voice, "The hardest parts I am thinking will be the replacements for the hyperdrive navigation and control system. I have seen little indication here of any form of space flight, yet your tech levels are extremely high..."</p>

<p>Snow had been sipping her Guinness for several moments in silence when she suddenly jerked and mumbled, "Shit!" At almost then same moment Shan stiffened also. Seeing the question on Rune's face prompted her to respond, "I had sent Shan to keep someone named Maelyn safe. Shan had taken her to our place but Maelyn left a while ago. She said she was worried about someone named Katy and had to go check on her. She was going to come right back. It's been way too long and Tyana has called to let me know. We need to try and find her. Might I ask you for backup? Shan, how did you come in?"</p>

<p>Shan led the way out the back of the Chatsubo and into the alley behind it. There she quickly made her way to a spot near a large dumpster against the back wall of the building. Shan pointed back the way they had come and said, "That way." Slowly they spread out and began looking for any clue as to which way Maelyn might have gone.</p>

<p>Several minutes later they met back near the dumpsters. "Nothing." Snow sighed in frustration. "Would Ratz know anything about her?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't hurt to ask." Rune replied. Within moments they were back at the bar. "Ratz, hey."</p>

<p>"Herr Rune."</p>

<p>"Do you know a girl named Maelyn?"</p>

<p>"She brings me old recipes and hangs out in the back booth. Why?"</p>

<p>"She left here tonight with something that might have gotten her into a great deal of trouble. Do you have any idea where else she tends to hang?"</p>

<p>"This is Chiba herr Rune. It is always dangerous." Ratz looked thoughtful a moment as he poured a drink for another patron. "I believe she often prowls the old ruins near the burn zone. That's where she finds those buables she is always fiddling with. More than that I couldn't tell."</p>

<p>"Couldn't or wouldn't?" Snow mummbled.</p>

<p>"Ah, SnowDancer is it? Did you find what you sought?" Ratz asked cooly. Giving her a hard stare.</p>

<p>"Yes. Thank you." She replied formally while meeting him stare for stare.</p>

<p>Finally Ratz dropped his eyes first. "I truly know no more. I ask her no questions about her life and she volunteers nothing. Like the rest of you here. It is Polite not to pry."</p>

<p>"Rune, ideas?"</p>

<p>"No. It's hours until daylight and we'd be fishing in the dark."</p>

<p>Snow started to pace. "I should have known. I'd lose it too if a bunch of strangers came at me. Good intentions or not. Shan, which way was she headed?"</p>

<p>Haltingly Shan managed to narrate the path Maelyn was on. "That's the burn zone alright. I sort of know it. There's an old complex of partial ruins that way that front on the burned out areas. We still won't see much tonight though. We could search faster in the light."</p>

<p>"I know, I know." Snow flopped down on a stool. "Ratz, something please. Something really strong."</p>

<p>Silently Ratz turned and performed some magic behind the bar. A few minutes later he put a small glass in front of her with reddish brown liquid in it. Snow nocked it back, pleased with the alcohol burn as it chased down her throat. "Excellent, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Asthma Attack. A recipe Maelyn found for me a few weeks ago."</p>

<p>"Another please." She tossed a small wad of nuyen on the bar. "Keep them coming for a while."</p>

<p>Ratz raised his etebrows a bit as Rune asked, "Am I going to have to help her out of here?"</p>

<p>"If she drinks very many of those, ja."</p>

<p>Snow winked at Rune. "Not a problem. The enhancements I carry run off alcohol fuel cells."</p>

<p></p>

</br>
</br>
<p>Instead of falling back to the Chatsubo back door, which Rune was frantically waving
at, in between blasts from his colt, Snow fell back toward the dumpster. When she saw
where Rune was going, she began frantically waving at him, &quot;Over HERE! It's safer
OVER HERE!!&quot; Behind her a rectangle of black suddenly appeared in the side of the
dumpster and heavy blaster fire erupted from within it. Snow continued to motion them her
way, all the while screaming, &quot;Alive Shan. I need one ALIVE!&quot;</p>

<p>As Snow neared the black rectangle she dropped to a low crouch and motioned Rune and
Eshlaini through in front of her. Then she stepped in and a heavy door swung closed. All
sound ceased as the door clicked shut and light quickly faded up to reveal a narrow stone
tunnel leading off. Standing near the door was a tall dark skinned woman wearing dark
armor made of some type of lizard skin. The scales were the size of large plates, very
much like the hide of a dragon from the latest interactive games. She smiled and held out
her hand, &quot;I'm Krystyl, pleased to meet you.&quot;</p>

<p>Slowly Snow walked down the passage toward a beaded curtain at the far end. Absently
she motioned for the others to follow her. She emerged into a room far too large to be
contained in the dumpster outside. The sunlight, filtered through ornamental gratings,
bathed the area in the faded yellow light of late afternoon. &quot;Welcome to our
traveling device. It is a transdimensional construct, woven of massive programs and arcane
majiks from many different worlds. Shan will be joining us shortly. She has captured one
of the strike force and thinks she can get him to us relatively in-tact. She's fairly
certain Maelyn is down in the sewers under the alley we were just in.&quot; As she
finished speaking a deep gong echoed through the court. As it faded away a ripping,
tearing feeling pulsed through everyone and the air seemed to sparkle with an inner light.
Almost instantly there was another gong and things returned to normal. Snow dropped
abruptly on one of the benches, looking drained and drawn. Her face had gone chalky in the
faded sunlight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She stood unsteadily and motioned to the others, &quot;We must move quickly. Shan saw a
couple of the attackers moving toward the sewers.&quot; It was obvious she was pushing
herself now as she hurried back to the entry passage. It wasn't quite the same as when
they had first entered. There was now a large wooden trap door in the middle of it that
hadn't been there before. &quot;Rune, could you please get that?&quot;</p>

<p>Rune threw his back into it and soon it had swung up and dropped back to rest on the
floor. Under it was the man-hole cover Shan had pointed to earlier. &quot;Again
please?&quot; Krys placed the spiked end of a large pry bar into a hole on the cover and
leaned into it. It started to lift, falling over with a loud clang when Rune threw his
weight in also. Revealed was a rusty, slimy ladder dropping into darkness. Faint dripping
water sounds mixed with labored breathing came from below.</p>

<p>Krys dropped to the floor and slowly eased her head over the hole. A quick look
revealed a huddled figure at the base of the ladder. One hand was thrown over her eyes,
trying to shield them from the glare. The other was cradled in her lap. Krys motioned Snow
over and the swapped places. &quot;Yes, that's her. Krys, could you pass her up to
us?&quot;</p>

<p>Krys pulled her blaster and slipped quickly into the tunnel. She waited several beats,
listening intently. As she bent to pick up Maelyn she heard a splash from further down the
tunnel. Instantly she slid around and fired a quick burst down toward the noise. She was
rewarded by a harsh scream. Taking advantage of the confusion she hoisted Maelyn up to the
others then hissed as a blaster scored a hit on her leg. She fired another burst, gaining
enough time to haul herself up to where Rune and Snow could grab hold of her and haul her
to safety. &quot;Hang on!&quot; Snow called. A gong sounded again and there was the same
discomfort and shimmer once more. Another gong came quickly on the heels of the first.
Snow collapsed against the nearest wall of the corridor and slid slowly to the floor where
her face dropped onto her knees. The trap door that had been in the floor was gone once
more.</p>

<p>Many long moments later she raised her head. She looked bad. Her eyes were glassy and
sunk deep into their sockets. Her face was pinched and drawn. In a strained voice she
said, &quot;That's it Krys. We might be able to get one more jump out of her before we
make repairs, but I don't think I'd want to chance it. The crystal matrix about shattered
on that one. The power recharge isn&#146;t happening very fast either.&quot;</p>

<p>Krys replied, &quot;I just hope we didn&#146;t compromise Shan.&quot;</p>

<p>Snow tried to struggle to her feet. &quot;Damn! Hand me your blaster, gotta see if I
can give her cover...&quot; She began crawling toward the door as Krys knelt to look at
Maelyn.</p>

<p>Rune grabbed it first and strode to the door. &quot;You, sit, stay and rest.&quot; He
swung the door open to the sounds of sporadic gun fire and small explosions. As he scanned
for a target he saw Shan drop heavily to the alley from one of the fire escapes. She
landed hard, almost falling over and nearly dropping the still form she carried.
Staggering heavily she wove her way toward the door. Another burst of fire caught her and
she dropped to her knees revealing a figure closing from behind her. Rune swung and fired,
watching a smoking hole burn its way into the figure behind her. In the resulting break in
fire he ran to her and slipped his free arm around her. Then they hurried back to through
the doorway. She smiled in relief, mouthing, &quot;Thank you,&quot; as he helped her
through the door.</p>

<p>Inside Snow and Krys eased the figure Shan was carrying to the floor, then helped her
down. She sat slumped against the wall mumbling, &quot;Healing slowed, things ok?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Those last two micro-jumps really took it out of the hut.&quot;</p>

<p>Krys briefly looked at the figure Shan had brought in, then returned to Maelyn. Snow
turned to Shan and said, &quot;Shan, I thought you said this one was alive...&quot;</p>

<p>Rune took a quick look also and spat, &quot;Corps security. They come loaded with
various suicide methods. He must have popped one when you caught him.&quot; Rune sighed.
He was going to need to do it. He mentally *reached* and grabbed what he thought of as the
Hook. Then he stuck his head out the door and calmly threw up. When he turned back to the
waiting room, Shan and Snow were looking at him incredulously.</p>

<p>&quot;Wha - oh! No no no. It's not because of the body. I just activated the
enhancements in my prosthetic spine. That's why it never made it to market, partly. When
you turn on the battlefield enhancements, there's a wave of severe nausea. Makes sense,
really. You're playing with the control signals to every muscle in your body,&quot; he
said quickly. The spine would only make him a hair's breadth quicker, but far *smoother*.
Like getting a dose of co-ordination.</p>

<p>&quot;So let's see what we can See,&quot; he said, snapping on the Avatar's datashades.
The body was cooling rapidly, but a warm spot remained in the rear of his cranium.
Frowning, he examined the skin behind the suicide commando's ear and found the telltale
scarring. He took off the 'shades and held his finger to his lips for silence. He handed
Snow the datashades and mimed putting them on. After a few tries she understood and donned
the wraparounds, frowning at what she saw. Rune still held the Avatar, and typed some data
to appear on the inside of the shades. &#145;dont talk our dead friend here is a bug --
the listening hardware in</p>

<p>his skull is still active even though he&#146;s gone &#133; eardrum still vibrates
right? Probably transmitting to a base right now&#146;</p>

<p>&quot;I think we should go back to A&#146;Brecht&#146;s shop. We can pawn this
meatloaf,&quot; Rune said, kicking the corpse for effect, &quot;for some armor and
weapons. A'Brecht'll sell 'im to the bonejackers for dog food.&quot; Inside the datashades
he keyed: &#145;disinformation, they&#146;ll come for abrecht guns blazing hoping to get
us. poetic fuckin justice! we gotta find a medic 4 Maelyn or somthin then maybe see finn.
up to you really got your back 4 whatevr its worth finn has medscan EQ but no doc, also
might want to destroy body if can transmit audio can transmit GPS location maybe&#146;</p>

<p>He pocketed the Avatar smoothly and cracked his knuckles loudly. Typing on the Avatar's
5-button interface could be incredibly irritating. He drew his Colt and refilled his half
spent clip from loose rounds in his coat pocket, put the gun back in &quot;Condition
2&quot;, having only to cock the hammer. Smiling gently, he tugged an assault rifle off
the dead commando's shoulder and took a handful of clips from his belt. It was a good gun
-- one of the new Heckler &amp; Koch caseless jobs. &quot;Anybody want this?&quot; he
asked, pointing the butt at Snow, &quot;It's a good piece, and meatloaf here don't need it
no more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks! Saves me some nuyen. Damn, I didn&#146;t even think to check him for
implants. I must be wiped&#133;&quot; She paused for a moment and her eyes sort of
un-focused, then she came back. &quot;Yeah, now I see it&quot; She thought about
Rune&#146;s comment for a moment, &quot;There might be a different sort of complication
actually&#133; This device, doesn&#146;t exist in &#145;Real-Space&#146;. It actually
exists in a pocket space, defined by an altered space-time dimension set. There is a
physical instantiation of the entry corridor&#133; sort of. Mostly it functions as an
interface node with &#145;Real-Space&#146; for entry and exit purposes. When the door is
closed nothing inside can communicate with outside except through a very tightly
controlled interface scheme. He isn&#146;t linked to that so&#133;&quot; she shrugged and
continued, &quot;The up side is we are VERY safe inside. The down side is right now moving
the entry node is not really possible, so all someone has to do is camp out around the
door and we have problems. I&#146;m curious, will it cause undue notice that he just
dropped out of sight? Or will the brief blip that got out when the door was opened send up
an alarm? Is there anything in that transponder that might tell us where he came
from?&quot;</p>

<p>Pocket reality? Rune shook his head. Advanced physics...metaphysics, even. Never one of
his strong subjects. &quot;The implant won&#146;t tell you anything. Probably a Micronics
ST-351, it&#146;s standard equipment on half the troops in the world. Won&#146;t matter
that he vanished, I don&#146;t think. The transponder could&#146;ve gone down if he&#146;d
died from a head-shot, right? And the blip when the door was open could just be the
batteries giving one last kick before they gave up the ghost.&quot; he replied, pacing.
&quot;There&#146;s more than a couple bodies outside. If his corp comes to investigate,
it&#146;ll seem odd that he&#146;s not out there,&quot; Rune said, drawing his Colt,
&quot;I could shoot him in the head, his transponder would go down. We dump him
outside...in the dumpster, maybe, so he&#146;s close to his last transmission. Nothing out
of the ordinary, just a team that ran into more than they could handle. Nothing to make
you think there was an entrance to an inter-dimensional construct anywhere near by...they
won&#146;t even look.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hopefully a corporate coroner with a fistful of bodies to examine will look at
his head wound and not even bother to check the blood for suicide toxins,&quot; Snow
pointed out. Rune turned to her, slightly surprised - he had forgotten about that, in his
rush.</p>

<p>He pointed the trigger at the corpse&#146;s head, &quot;Too bad he can&#146;t transmit.
I wouldn&#146;t mind seeing A&#146;Brecht get smeared like the bug he is.&quot; The
Colt&#146;s slide snapped back once, and as the roar died down, the heavy brass casing
could be heard dancing along the floor, its gentle chiming completely at odds with the
violence just done.</p>

<p>PROCESS &#150; CheckThreadStatus( Ref=Maelyn )</p>

<p>Maelyn managed to sit up and lean her back against one of the corner walls of the weird
alcove. Her arms fell limply against the tops of her knees, though she carefully avoided
jabbing her infected implant. She slowly surveyed the room around her, head slightly
cocked to the floor so her bangs fell into her face and partially obscured the fact that
she was scared shitless.</p>

<p>Strange women regarded her with what looked like a mix between curiosity and antipathy.
She knew Rune had been here only a few minutes before. She'd seen him briefly through the
haze when she was carried here, between the bursts of gunfire and the shouting. She didn't
know Rune personally, but she had seen him from around the Chat and that was enough to
lend at least a little comfort.</p>

<p>There was a chill deep in her. Her bones felt super-cooled and her skin was clammy and
damp. It had taken her this long to realize she was shaking, partly out of fear, but she
felt sick. The slick black spot on her arm was pulsing, sending light currents of nausea
up her bicep and across her chest. Maybe that's why they're looking at me, she thought; I
probably look like shit...</p>

<p>The world around her shattered and splintered into a thousand shards of sound as a
gunshot went off nearby. Maelyn instinctively pulled her knees up into her chest and
cupped her hands over her ears, squeezing her eyes shut as she buried her face into her
legs. It felt like someone has taken hold of her spine and jerked it like a guitar string.
Her eyes watered, not out of pain, but out of fear. The echo of the shot only seemed to
amplify itself in her skull as it faded down the corridor.</p>

<p>It was easier to stay like this, with her head in her knees and her eyes closed. She
didn't have to look at anyone, and if she tried she could almost pretend that no one was
around to look at her, either. Besides, her semi-prone position was much more convenient
if she decided to indulge her increasing desire to vomit. This was too much, too fast.
Someone is just going to come along and put a bullet in my head, she thought. Goodbye Mae.</p>

<p>She used to sit and watch the people in the Chat with all their fancy chrome and wires
and engineered bodies, and she wondered. She used to puzzle over what they did when they
left the place, out into the Chiban night. What kind of lives did they have that required
so many enhancements? Sitting here, cowering in the corner like a little girl in the dark,
she silently wished she were still ignorant.</p>

<p>PROCESS &#150; ResumeThread( Ref=SnowDancer )</p>

<p>Rune lowered his gun with a sigh, this sort of thing was not his style. Events had been
set in motion, and he was a speck of foam on the wave. This Maelyn girl was huddled in a
corner, head down, looking terrified.</p>

<p>Shan hauled herself upright. Rune noticed the slug wound in her shoulder was already
looking as if it had been healing for over a week. She moved slowly to the corpse and
heaved it up over her shoulder. &quot;I back soon.&quot; Rune moved the quickest of the
rest and opened the door for her as she walked out. Slowly she approached the real
dumpster, behind the &#145;Chat, and heaved the body up into it. Then she fast walked back
into the corridor.</p>

<p>Snow turned to Krys, &quot;Can you do anything for her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I could dress the wounds, but I don't know what to give her for the infection.
I'm not sure anything we have would work on her. Just because they look like us
doesn&#146;t mean the biology works the same.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rune, would you mind helping us get to Finn's? We need to get Maelyn medical
attention and I don't want a repeat of the A'Brecht scene...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Sure, sure,&quot; he said, almost absentmindedly, as he made his way over to the
frightened woman. He released the clip from his Colt and cycled the round out of the
chamber, setting both carefully on the ground as he approached. She must know he meant no
harm. Frightened and hurt, she would be capable of desperate things.</p>

<p>&quot;Here,&quot; he said, hunkering down in front of her and taking her arm, &quot;let
me see this.&quot; The opening in her arm was revolting, tissue ailing from the infection
raging within. Silently, he cursed the nasty combination formed by the new
antibiotic-resistant bacteria of the world, and cheap sub-dermal implants that came from
companies more concerned about the bottom line than user safety. Frowning, he
unceremoniously stuck his hand down the back of her shirt, feeling the temperature of her
back, just as his mother had done when he was a kid. Mae jumped uncertainly at the
invasion of her very personal space in the form of his cold hand, but seemed too weak to
protest in a more violent way. &quot;You're burning up,&quot; he said to her, then, to
everyone, &quot;I'm no doctor, but I think if her temperature goes up much more, she'll
pass out.&quot;</p>

<p>Snow turned and slowly approached Mae, &quot;I know you don't know any of us. Truly, we
mean you no harm. We are going to take you to Finn's for a medical check. You appear to
have a very bad infection going in your arm. Might I ask - do you have any idea who is
chasing you, or why they are?&quot; </p>

<p>While Snow was talking to Mae, Shan turned to head into the court. &quot;Change, before
go.&quot; She said, waving her hand at her torn and stained clothes.</p>

<p>&quot;Why? You look more fearsome that way,&quot; Krys commented, looking at the slug
holes, burns, blood stains, and the blackish-green stains around Shan's healing injuries.</p>

<p>&quot;Maelyn, can you walk?&quot; Snow asked. &quot;Rune, about how far do we need to
go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Finn's place is a couple miles from here, as the crow flies. Maybe more by
the streets. Problem is, it's Stone Dog territory between here and there. They'll see Mae
as a weakness, start trouble. Nothing we can't handle, but Mae might get caught in the
shitstorm,&quot; he said, looking down at her. She looked like she couldn't dodge the
taxman, let alone a few hundred speeding bullets, &quot;Normally I wouldn't bother, since
it's so expensive, but we might call the Chiba Cab Company.&quot; Snow looked at him
ruefully, one eyebrow arched.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Riiiight,&quot; Rune said, scratching his head in embarrassment, &quot;You're new
in town. You've only seen the underbelly of Chiba so far, black market stuff. During the
day, there's a steady gray market - stuff that's almost legal. Lot of money comes through
here, and lots of people skim a little bit of that off to stay alive. The CCC is one of
those outfits. They bought a bunch of old Israeli troop transports and set them up with
low-level AI auto-pilot. Pretty dumb, but it can get you from point A to point B without
getting perforated. They rip you off royally, too, but if you're worried enough to call
them, they've already got you where they want you.&quot;</p>

<p>Snow looked over at Mae, who was looking around the bizarre room with a kind of
wild-eyed terror. Soon she would be raving from the fever. &quot;Sounds good,&quot; Snow
said, hoping her newly formed bankroll could support the extravagance. It could, Rune
knew, with a little help from his own - after all, his ass was on the line too.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I'll have to call from outside,&quot; he said. Then, turning with the
same lazy efficiency of a cat, he left, pulling the Avatar out of a pocket as he went.</p>

<p>The scene in the alleyway wasn't pretty. Not used to the carnage, Rune was grateful
he'd already lost his lunch when he turned on his spinal enhancements. He held the
Avatar's cool magnesium case in his right hand, snapping the shades on with the left. The
Avatar was many things, but a cellular phone was not one of them - too much hassle when
everything was on the matrix anyway.</p>

<p>He came at the CCC's matrix site clumsily, too tired to care about style points. In a
few seconds, he had placed his request, paid part of the fee with his own account,
directed that the rest would be cash at the end of the journey. &quot;ETA: 5 min,&quot;
the computer agent claimed, giving him an Ident code for access, as well. May as well go
back inside and wait.</p>

<p>He looked at the side of the dumpster with some apprehension, remembering it had looked
like a doorway from the other side. He'd been in too much of a hurry to worry about it
before, but now it seemed odd. As he strode towards it he more than half expected to run
into solid dumpster with a darker arch painted on it, just like the painted-on-tunnel of a
thousand and one roadrunner cartoons. He'd just walk into it with a hollow CLANGG and fall
to the ground, and somewhere, a studio audience would laugh.</p>

<p>He shook the silliness out of his head with a mental growl, and passed through the
portal without even noticing. Inside the short entry corridor Snow was leaning over
Maelyn, preparing her to travel. Rune thought he could hear her raving something about a
guy that used to walk around her town in a black trench coat, even in the middle of
summer. Shan leaned against a wall, freshly changed, and looking bored. Rune stretched
backwards, a habit from back when he had a real spine to crack, and felt something dig
into his side.</p>

<p>Frowning he reached around and pulled out...the Shrenka longknife. Its dull black
handle fit in his fist, the blade itself protruding through his fingers on a shaft,
looking for all the world like a gardening spade's evil cousin. But he knew firsthand how
brutal such a blade could be. He didn't even know how to use it - had no idea why he still
carried it after all these years. He walked over to Shan, thinking of her inhuman speed
and strength.</p>

<p>&quot;Somebody stabbed me with this, long time ago, &quot; he said simply, masking his
feelings as he pressed the blade's handle into her palm, &quot;You seem to be a
real...up-close-and-personal kind of fighter, maybe you can use it. I hate it more than I
can really explain. Keep it or throw it in the sewer, up to you.&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment intelligence flared back into her eyes as she examined the blade. First
she stared closely at it, before sighing, &quot;Not hull metal.&quot; Then she swiped it
around first with her right hand, then with her left. After testing the edge she placed it
where she could grab it with her left hand if she needed it. &quot;Thanx.&quot; She leaned
back against the wall and faded back away.</p>

<p>Rune turned and went back out the portal-in-the-dumpster to look for the Cab. He spent
a few minutes trying to sort out what had happened in the last few days of his life before
the Cab showed up, sparing him from the futility.</p>

<p>It was a big, six wheeled monster of armor plate and hydraulics, crawling up to him
with the smooth whine of well-kept diesel turbines. The heavy multi-ply bulletproof tires
came nearly up to his chest as it rumbled to a halt, waiting. He spent a moment staring at
the crappy gray primer-coat that didn't quite hide the old desert camouflage scheme for a
few moments before realizing it wanted the Ident number. There was a numeric keypad on the
back, 0-F. Rune smiled at the use of hex -</p>

<p>it was the sort of thing he would do, cramming more information in less digits than
decimal. He punched in the code with a flourish and the rear opened like a clamshell,
revealing a comfortable inner chamber in keeping with the wealth of the Cab's normal
users.</p>

<p>Turning back to the dumpster, he spotted Snow's disembodied head. He started a little,
but fought himself back down. She had stuck her head out the portal to check on him, and
that was all that showed, looking like it was sticking right out of the side of the
dumpster. Irritated by his own foolishness, he merely gestured for her to bring everyone
out so they could get going.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a good thing the Cab was comfortable, since it sure as hell was *noisy*. The
incessant racket of the drive-train to the six wheels and the whine of the turbine kept
conversation down to a bare minimum.</p>

<p>Snow sat with Maelyn's head in her lap. Unconsciously she smoothed Maelyn's hair back
from her face. Her thoughts bounced between memories of Amanda, her first actual lover,
and Kara, lying injured in the hut. The explosion of the auxiliary power system had caught
Will and Kara while they were checking system status. So far they were healing slowly, but
Tyana was certain they'd never fully recover unless the hut was repaired. Sitting and
thinking she realized she had lost track of how long she and Kara had been together. It
seemed like just yesterday they'd met, but there had been so many shared experiences since
then.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PROCESS &#150; CheckThreadStatus( Ref=Maelyn )</p>

<p>There was hair stuck to her forehead. It was annoying her, but the thought of more
waves of pain and nausea kept her from reaching over and brushing it aside. Besides, for
all her nervousness she was comfortable lying across the cab's back seat. Well, as
comfortable as she could be.</p>

<p>Maelyn let herself drift back to Jaco, on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. The cold
damp feeling of her skin reminded her of the summer days as a girl, sweating on the black
volcanic beaches before going in to the chill air conditioned villa owned by her mother.
Everything was so simple when she was little.</p>

<p>There was a pile of rocks next to the house, and on the hottest days she would go
searching through the sun-heated stones for scorpions to scare Kevver. Mae managed a weak
laugh despite herself, remembering how she would get in trouble for all the nasty things
she did to her little brother. They were young. It was fun before the soldiers came, but
Mae always wanted to skip that part of home. She was young enough at the time that it was
almost possible.</p>

<p>It wasn't until everything was gone that she knew how much she missed all of them. Mae
tried to block out the terrible faces of the fallout troops as they flooded the sands up
from Panama to steal her family, and when she cut it all off she could almost forgive
them. Poor souls burned and deformed from the holocaust in Panama, trying to escape the
radioactive fields. Without military, Costa Rica had been a prime refuge. No resistance
and the powers north were too busy with the Secession Wars to really notice what was
happening.</p>

<p>The cab rocked, sending Maelyn into spasms of pain. From behind her eyes she saw the
flashing light, and felt motion around her. The woman who held Mae's head in her lap
leaned forward, sending more stray hair into Mae's eyes. The world began to spin out of
control, and she could feel her eyelids fluttering as her eyes tracked rapidly back and
forth in her skull. She tried to hold on, but the weakness and pain was creeping forward
like ants under her skin, until it finally pulled consciousness from her once again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PROCESS &#150; ResumeThread( Ref=SnowDancer )</p>

<p>Shan looked for all the world like she was asleep, head leaned into a corner of the
cabin, eyes closed. Rune let his mind wander, daydreaming for the most part.</p>

<p>He was reflecting about his first girlfriend when all hell broke loose. Well, it tried
to break loose, but came over as only a dull boom over the sound of the drive-train.
Sporadic gunfire could be heard pinging off the carrier's hull. Shan's eyes snapped open
and took in what little there was to see through the view slits nearest her.</p>

<p>&quot;Stone Dogs,&quot; Rune called over the racket, &quot;Obligatory pot
shots...&quot; He was about to say, &quot;comes with the territory&quot; when there was a
dull boom and fire suddenly washed over the tiny window slits. &quot;Shit!&quot; he yelled
- explosives definitely did NOT come with the territory. He made his way to the door just
in case they all had to deploy for a firefight, when Shan grabbed his arm and sat him down
again.</p>

<p>&quot;No party,&quot; she said, sadly. </p>

<p>Then, at his puzzled look, Snow elaborated for him, &quot;Decoy attack. Fire but no
explosive, just incendiary, right? They're trying to lure us into stopping and getting out
for a firefight we can't win.&quot;</p>

<p>Rune nodded, suddenly understanding. Thank god somebody here knew something about real
combat. He felt more out of his element than ever.</p>

<p>The gunfire continued for a couple minutes more, then faded away as the Stone Dogs
realized no one was rising to the bait. Ten minutes later the 'cab' rolled to a halt and a
light came on, saying, &quot;Trip Complete. Please deposit correct amount in scan
slot.&quot; Snow slowly approached the heavily shielded slot and began feeding nuyen into
it. She fed it a large amount of her stash, then Rune added some of his own before it was
satisfied. Several muffled clanks and whirs sounded before the door clam-shelled open and
revealed another stretch of roadway. There were more lights here. Entertainment joints
fought for the sporadic street traffic with the cheap bars. A few all night eating holes
and shops filled the spaces between the two. Set deep in the side of the building to the
left was the entrance to Finn's.</p>

<p>Snow looked first to Rune, then to Shan, &quot;I'll go out first, Rune you follow. Once
we are sure things are quiet, Shan will follow with Maelyn. Ready? Go.&quot; Snow slipped
quickly from the cab, acting as casual as she could while still scanning every aspect of
their surroundings. Rune followed quickly, doing his own scan. Finally, Shan stepped out,
cradling Maelyn in her arms. As a single unit they moved toward Finn's with Rune and Snow
flanking Shan and Maelyn, forming an alert, if thin, wall of flesh around the delirious
girl. Shan tried in vain to quiet her, for tactical reasons if nothing else.</p>

<p>&quot;Katy katy..katy... you the virus b't I got the bugs... deadbug chip got me...dead
bang...g'bye mae, ash to ash, dust to dust,&quot; she whispered softly, flopping loosely
in Shan's arms.</p>

<p>Rune pushed the babbling out of his mind and scrutinized the storefront closely. The
sign above the door read &quot;Nippon import/export&quot; with accompanying japanese
characters hastily painted below. It was a long way from the Finn's digs in the big apple,
but Rune had always known the irritable little fence had a bigger operation than most
people suspected.</p>

<p>He pushed the battered green fire door open, revealing a flight of steps to the second
floor. Springy black rubber had been stapled over the risers in layers, giving the whole
thing a shapeless, careless air. SnowDancer slipped in the door and checked the stairs,
while Shan patiently lugged Mae into the foyer. &quot;Upstairs, door on the right,&quot;
Rune said, gesturing vaguely.</p>

<p>The inside of the office was what one might expect of an import export house. Dirty
crates crouched on the floor at irregular intervals, most of them open, empty, and
dribbling packing material on the floor. At the rear of the office the Finn stood behind a
waist-high crate, his left hand drumming on the top, his right hidden behind the crate
with the rest of him.</p>

<p>Someone else was moving behind him, methodically back and forth as though making an
inspection. The shadows in the room and the clutter of boxes made it impossible to tell
much about the second figure. Shan tensed and SnowDancer moved her hand closer to her
weapon as they filed into the room. </p>

<p>&quot;Shouldn't you be in Boston?&quot; Finn said, presumably to Rune.</p>

<p>&quot;Shouldn't you be in New York?&quot; Rune fired back. That right hand was probably
resting on the functional equivalent of a sawed-off, though Rune doubted the Finn would go
for anything as...pedestrian as that. &quot;We both know Chiba City's where the action
is,&quot; Rune said.</p>

<p>&quot;And what action is that?&quot; the Finn said, laying his right hand and weapon on
the crate. It held a short, fat cylinder emblazoned with the Sig-Sauer logo. Rune winced.
It was one of those new flechette cannons. The tips would be coated with neurotoxin.</p>

<p>The figure drifting in the rear stopped, suddenly paying attention to what was going on
up front. His hand went up to his throat, presumably activating some implant in
anticipation of trouble, but he was still too far in the shadows for any of them to quite
make out exactly what it was he had done.</p>

<p>Shan laid Maelyn down behind a crate and got ready to party, her eyes becoming
animated, scanning the room quickly. Snow tensed, preparing to bring her H&amp;K to bear.
A'Brecht had left a bad taste in their mouths, and they were in no mood for shit, Rune
guessed.</p>

<p>&quot;Medscan for our friend here, maybe do a deal on some medicine, &quot; Rune said,
indicating the limp form of Mae, &quot;got a nasty infection around her implant. One of
those cheap TeleDyne subcutaneous jobs.&quot;</p>

<p>The shadowy man relaxed and began to move forward. As he did, the dirty fixture
illuminated his slim, pale face and sweat-stained tanker. The sound of his steps indicated
he was wearing heavy boots, probably reinforced combat types. His grey eyes stayed fixed
on Maelyn as he moved.</p>

<p>&quot;Armor for two, myself and her...&quot; Snow said, motioning toward Shan.</p>

<p>The man skirted the crate behind which Finn was standing and went to Maelyn, kneeling
down on one knee. Shan made a slight move when he reached out for the girl's arm, but his
demeanor quickly told her he wasn't a threat. Taking Mae's infected limb in his hands, he
turned it over, pressing gently into the blackened skin with his thumb. Vicious dark
liquid welled from the pores.</p>

<p>&quot;Two k-cred for the scan, and we'll talk about the rest as we go,&quot; Finn said
flatly, meeting Snow's eyes. Rune saw her eyes narrow dangerously at the figure.</p>

<p>&quot;Bullshit, Finn. We don't have time for bullshit,&quot; Rune said tiredly, his
hand creeping up to rub the bridge of his nose.</p>

<p>&quot;And that's _exactly_ why it's 2 instead of 1,&quot; Finn said, unperturbed,
&quot;'Course, we could barter it out. I got some IP I want you to look at, tell me if
it's for real or not, tell me what it's worth. That'll cover the scan.&quot;</p>

<p>Rune nodded, he could evaluate some Intellectual Property, but asked, &quot;What about
Snow and Shan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Different deal altogether,&quot; Finn replied. &quot;One deal at a time. Bring
her in back and let's get her on the scan bed.&quot; Finn flashed a glance over to the man
inspecting Mae's arm. &quot;Looks like this is your lucky day, Derrik. Mind taking a crack
at her while you're here?&quot; Derrik stood, lurking over the pile of a girl. He looked
over to Shan, motioning his head &quot;this way&quot; before turning to walk away back
toward the boxes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Shan had hoisted Maelyn onto a dull stainless steel table and she
and Snow were peering eagerly over Derrik's shoulder as he worked the scanner. Rune
wondered if they could even read the English text as it scrolled across the old-fashioned
CRT. He thought he heard one of them mutter, &quot;Would have been close enough. Damn,
next time...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot; Shan's voice asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't know - maybe that one evac...&quot; Snow mumbled back.</p>

<p>For his own part, Rune negotiated a Virtual Object Database, once the property of a
research lab in Geneva, apparently. He flipped through the data present on the Finn's
cobbled-together system -- code, graphs, white papers, the whole schebang. It detailed the
construction of a fairly economical rail-gun variant. According to one of the white
papers, normal rail-guns took megajoules of energy to operate, making them suitable for
nuclear-powered ships only. However, the package outlined a variant on the traditional
railgun design that synthesized advances in computer control technology with a quantum
leap in the superconductor field, yielding a rail-gun that ran on an order of magnitude
less power. Suggested applications included mechanized armor and space based platforms.
Rune studied meg after meg of diagrams, schematics, control code, and finally decided that
there was a good chance it was for real. </p>

<p>Across the room, the Finn and Derrik had finished their scan and were examining the
results. Something was not normal about the implant. Contrary to Rune's first guess, it
was a Padisan Teletronics device, but it had some kind of preprocessor that Finn couldn't
identify.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Rune, come over here,&quot; the Finn called, not looking up from the scan.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm busy, man, you want this evaluated or not?&quot;</p>

<p>Finn sighed, that was true, &quot;Alright, then, you know what a M56009-Z4 Chip
is?&quot;</p>

<p>Rune looked up from the Finn's system, frowning quizzically. He was pretty much
finished anyway. He answered, &quot;Errr, an old DSP, I think. Pre-millennium. Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what I wanna know - why? Come take a look at this.&quot;</p>

<p>SnowDancer silently moved out of the way as he came closer, giving him a view over the
Finn's shoulder. There was indeed, a small bit of circuitry on the front end of the
implant. It was hard to trace it all out on the screen, as it all showed up in x-ray, but
he could clearly read the M56009-Z4 designation on one of the chips.</p>

<p>&quot;Beats the hell outta me, man. That's some old hardware, I don't know much about
it. I was still a kid when they were using those,&quot; Rune admitted.</p>

<p>Snow walked to the edge of the table, careful to pick her way around the coils of cable
strewn all over the floor. Mae was covered in sweat, still muttering &quot;Katy&quot; from
time to time. She brushed the younger woman's hair out of here eyes gently.
&quot;Mae?&quot; she said, softly, &quot;Can you hear me Mae? The men are worried about
your implant, neither of them know what some of it does.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;katy? no, you're not...implant? has compression 'ncryption stuff...careful,
'sfull, dangerous nfo...&quot; she drifted off again, her head sagging back to the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, that implant's probably gonna have to come out,&quot; Derrik started,
&quot;And she's got at least 3 different kinds of bacteria in the arm. She's gonna need
immuno-boosters, heavy duty antibiotics, too. And of all those three, all Finn has is the
immuno stuff, and he'd prolly make that a separate deal&quot;. Derrik shot Finn a
contemptuous look. &quot;I know what that thing is in her arm, and can do a hack
extraction right here. It might not be pretty, but it's free.&quot;</p>

<p>Finn made to protest, but Derrik quickly cut into him. &quot;Cut the bullshit Finn. The
circuits are corroding, and if I don't get it out soon she'll suffer blood poisoning and
die.&quot; Finn stopped. He didn't need a corpse lying around the shop. For all he knew
the girl had friends.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides,&quot; Derrik continued, appealing to Finn's greed &quot;whatever's in
here might make you a quick cred.&quot; He turned, went to Mae and leaned over the wound,
pulling an overhead medlamp to further inspect the dark mass of infected tissue.
&quot;Call Tom. Tell him to bring my gear.&quot;</p>
