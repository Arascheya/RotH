<p class="regtxt5">posted 02-25-2003</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A tall woman, with silver hair left long and braided limps in through the door and makes her way to the bar. There are lines around her eyes and mouth, leaving her looking neither old nor young. She is dressed in a worn and tattered olive drab flight suit with I. Katarya on the name tag. "Ratz, an Asthma Attack and a Guiness please."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Certainly SnowDancer. I haven't seen you in here in a very long time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know. It's been a strnage time of late." He places her drinks near her elbow and she turns to take them, pausing long enough to read through the questions on a nearby terminal and then grins ruefully to herself. "Ms. Hyde hmmm. Seems that would be more like Shan, ah well..." She mumbles to no one in particular. Sliding well-worn nuyen to Ratz for the drinks, plus a generous tip she turns and surveys the rest of the patrons. Her face lights into a wide grin when she sees a familiar dark dressed figure at a corner table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She slides her way through the tables, careful not to spill her drinks, and stops at the table. "Rune? Heya, it's been a long time." Suddenly a bit hesitant she motions to a chair near him that faces back into the room, "May I join you?"</p>
</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">From Rune</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rune looked up and grinned in unabashed delight, "Please do."  Standing in awkward disused courtesy, he pulls the chair out for her to sit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It *has* been a long time," he says, thinking back over the last few years, "I hope you've been well?"  He settles back down and takes a swig of his only vaguely cold beer, grimaces at it and pushes it away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ye gods, I really am becoming a beer snob in my old age," he chuckles, "It goes with the profession, I guess.  A sort of obligatory knowledge of mood-altering beverages.  I still use that turkish coffee recipe of Shan's."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So are you Back?" he asks, the capital nearly audible, "The place is kind of quiet lately, but you never know what spark may set it off again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">-rune-</p>

<p class="regtxt5">(Heya!)</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">From Snow - 02-26-2003</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Snow settles into the offered chair, gives Rune a warm smile, and takes a pull from her Asthma Attack. "Mostly intact. The corp job turned out to be much better than I'd hoped. Now that it might be ending I find myself rather disappointed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Noticing Rune's grimace she motions toward the untouched Guiness, "You're welcome to it if you'd like..." She takes a smaller sip of her drink before continuing, "There's a story in the corp events but it'll take a little bit to gather the thoughts together."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad you like the coffee. It's really good after a long bout of code. We are Back, yes." Snow puts a similar weight in her reply. "Life is always uncertain, but I have missed this place. The drinks and the company. I've lost touch with Mae and Derrik as well. I hope they are ok after all that went down."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Snow looks over from her table and says, "Yeah, I know how it goes. Doesn't just hit IT though. I was hired as a consultant on a bit of technology by Ramer Batzel, something to do with their involvement in the Multinational Space Initiative. Well I shot my mouth off at the wrong time and got hijacked by their parent Corp, Ronin DigiTronics and put in charge of an infrastructure project. Not cuz I was management material or anything, but because I was from the outside and they figured they could use me as the puppet to get the work done. It wasn't bad at first, it's a delightful mix of programming and integration and quite challenging. The project was the darling of a couple high-ups and we got what we needed, but cuz we're infrastructure that changed as soon as the quarterlies went down. Now it's the usual - we're taking another of your team and moving up the go-live for the project anyway..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She smiles bitterly and sighs, "Ah well..." Then she downs the last of her drink and motions to the approaching wait-person. "Another please."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">tadpol drops himself down at the table where the old one ranted.  Waving a waitress (er, or is that one a waiter?) to get a refill as the rant closes, he turns back to the ded.  "Sysadmins never get enough for the abuse they take.  Is why I got out of the line of work."  clearing the last swallow from his glass, "Noone ever notices you until its broken, and they never understand the need to fix any *before* it breaks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With a half laugh as his eyes try to find out what is hold up his next drink tadpol adds, "So I move into software design where I usually get to sometimes be creative.  In between the times when I am explaining that something will take four days - will take four days from when I *start*, not from when I first said four days."  Tad drums his fingers a bit as the waiter (uh, waitress?) returns with a puzzled look and a drink. "Yeah I don't know either." tad tells the waitperson (definitly human) "But its dark and fermented and not killing me instantly." and takes a sip. "yep, same as what I had before.  oh well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">a cool breeze blew to the east,  a butterfly farted in taiwan,  and Goobs returned to the Chatsubo.  Chaos reigned supreme.  She smiled warmly as the little red door swung open to greet her.  "Hey Charlie, how've you been?" she asked.  the little door squeeked back a chirpy little reply, which to someone who can't speak door, sounded a lot like he needed oiling.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Looking around the bar, there was some buzzing activity around Rune's table but otherwise it was pretty quiet.  Goobs picked out the sturdiest bar stool she could find (she'd been known to sleep on them, and a rickety stool meant hitting the floor sooner rather than later), and settled in for a  morning of drinking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ratz sidled over to the girl he hadn't seen in nearly a year.  "must be ze day for reunions."  he grinned.  business must be slow. Ratz never grins unless he's truly happy to see you, and he's only happy to see you if business is slow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ratz, i'm about to make your day." smiled goobs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"why is zat mein liebchen?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Drinks all around, and you can even shaft me on the prices and i won't mind for once!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the smile on Ratz' face widened into something that almost looked genuine. it was a shame the bar didn't have many patrons in today.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"fuck it! i'm in a good mood for once, keep the tabs on me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Goobs handed Ratz a new and shiny cred chip. he scanned it to check she was good for the money.  His eyes lit up and his smile grew even wider.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"i see buziness is doing vell."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"yeah.  i'm coming to the end of another acquisition.  a personal matter which has been giving me grief for a while.  i've got a couple weeks  March 12th i'm gonna need a few people wasted.  just waiting on their signatures for now, it could hold things up further if they go missing too soon."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">SnowDancer looks up and smiles, waving  the server over to claim a free drink before the offer disappears. "And Rune will have another of those as well. At least I think he will when he wakes up again," she adds, pointing to his glass of warm beer. "Thanks for the drink!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A chair slid back and suddenly Mambo was looming over the table like an overdue mortage payment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Free drinks? In the Chatsubo? I don't think I have an option but to join in. Ratz! How close can you get to one of the Royal Bar's "Royal Cocktails?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The grubby pink claws rasps across Ratz' chin while he thinks for a momment. "In taste or in price?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A smile forms around the ruin of russian steel as the barkeep gets to work.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Goobs sidles over to Mambo.  'if you're going to drain my funds with that crap, you'll have to down a fair few.  try this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">she throws a tatty old recipe page ripped out of something or other...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"...To make a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster using Terran (Earth TM) ingredients:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">a.. Take the liquid contained in a 200 ml bottle of EverClear to remind you that your head will be clear forever if you drink too many Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters, and that your brain will clear of anything soon after you start drinking some, if not before.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">b.. Into it, slowly pour a 750 ml bottle of Bombay Sapphire to remind you of the marvelous beauty of the old Santraginean seas, or an equal amount of Jeremiah Weed in acknowledgement of what has happened to the Santraginean Seas and their lifeforms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">c.. Now add 750 ml of Cold Wild Turkey, letting it run into the mixture as we run through life to remind us of all the lifeforms we meet and experience while hitchhiking through the galaxy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">d.. Speedily stirring, add 375 ml of Herradua Tequila, mixing it in to commemorate the galactic hitchhikers who died of pleasure among the vapors and gasses in the marshes of Fallia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">e.. Over the bowl of a silver spoon, let flow 1 liter of rum in memory of the waterfalls and their glorious rainbows encountered on your journeys through the galaxy of life.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">f.. Next, drop in the worm found in a bottle of Musquil, watching it dissolve into the mixture. If the bottom falls out and the worm survives, drink at your own risk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">g.. Finally, sprinkle into the mixture some Gatorade to commemorate the lifeforms which have vanished and are becoming extinct, both sentient   and non-sentient, especially those most in need of aid.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If this many Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters are too many for the number of people you think you are, mix together the following amounts of ingredients as described above for a single serving.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">1.. 1 oz. EverClear</p>

<p class="regtxt5">2.. 4 oz. Bombay Sapphire or Jeremiah Weed</p>

<p class="regtxt5">3.. 4 oz. Cold Wild Turkey</p>

<p class="regtxt5">4.. 2 oz. Herredura Tequila</p>

<p class="regtxt5">5.. 5 oz. Rum</p>

<p class="regtxt5">6.. 1 worm from bottle of Mezcla</p>

<p class="regtxt5">7.. 2 oz. Gatorade</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This makes one approximately 18 ounce Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. The reason this drink seems so large is that Zaphod Beeblebrox has two heads, so when he created it, it came out to 9 ounces per head, so both were happy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Before drinking, eat one olive to create a sweetness in it which is not there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Drink very, very extremely carefully at your own risk, and remember where your towel is (if you can). .."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ratz pouts, not sure if at the thought of the skunk steeped in vodka or at the suggestion that there might be a drink he _didn't_ have behind the bar, but after some research produces a flat bottle of emerald liquid, much to
HeaDCase's delight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Develop your eccentricity while you're young.  That way, when you are old, people don't think you're going gaga." anounces HeaDCase grinning, and pours
himself a glass of the stuff.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Snow turns back to Rune, "Thanks again for tweaking the stuff in my head. Between you and Derek it is working great." She continued after the lone server brought her another Asthma Attack, complements of Goobs. "Well my friend, I seem to have gotten into it again. The deal with Ramer Batzel looked like it was going to be reasonable. I arranged to meet with my contact and dump the tech data in payment for the supplies they agreed to. When I showed up we were just getting ready to do the transfers when some Ronin DigiTronics infrastructure dweebs showed up. They had chosen that exact time to link the low level AI of Ramer into the corporate net of Ronin. It probably wouldn't have been a problem but I asked one of them what they were doing and he was stupid enough to answer. Anyway the short of it is they were screwing things up and I knew it. Next thing I know I'm told to come back the next day and I am escorted out by the security types."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Figuring to keep things level I go back the next day and my contact tells me my info contract has been sold to Ronin. I am then taken to another office and 'offered' employment on the AI integration project they were doing. I debated running but I really needed their supplies and the offer wasn't unreasonable. Live in the Arcology for the duration with some privileges to go outside and still get the supplies. Within months I was in charge of the project, where I've been since. Like I was saying, not 'cuz I'm a manager, but 'cuz I'm an easy scapegoat." She smiles bitterly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Things have been good until recently. I don't know if it's just that the project is almost finished or if there is something else going on. Anyway, with my contract nearing term I'm getting nervous. I know a lot of people manage to leave a corporate gig and move on, just nothing about this whole affair has been standard. So far I think they still believe I am meat-ware only. I've kept masking my enhancements and no one has said anything. That being the case I know they want to twist my brain before I walk. I'm just thinking they'll want me to walk out into the street and volunteer as a body donor." She grins predatorily, "won't happen, but it would put me directly at war with a corp and that I don't need." she took another sip and stared into the reddish liquid, for a moment seeing it as blood instead of just a drink. "worst of it is I think they have the same ideas for the rest of the team as well. None of them are corp regulars but they're all damn good. Gods, I hate this." Silence falls over her again for many long moments until she gives a short, bitter laugh. "I know, I should look to mine and leave the others to look to theirs. Just they are mine in a way. For three years we've been a team and now to just stand back doesn't feel right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rune listened quietly (something his exes assured him he did quite well, yet they remained his exes nonetheless) as SnowDancer told him of her recent exploits in the local corporate economy.  When she finished, it was a matter of debate if he was paler or not.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Excuse me," he flagged down a waitress, who stopped and favored him with a Look for interrupting her on her way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah?" Annoyance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is the tab still on Goobs?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah."  More annoyance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bring me a double of the Macallan, 25.  Neat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah."  And she wandered off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Service here hasn't improved," Snow observed dryly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Neither have the tips," Rune grinned, then more seriously, "I'm glad your implants have stayed tuned.  Not my usual field, but I made an exception, given the nature of the tech."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Still trying to reverse engineer it?"  She gave a small smile; while she wished him luck at it, his chances were something like the proverbial snowball in hell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course -- if I'd cracked it, I'd be retired already," he accidentally took a sip from his skunk beer and grimaced before pushing it away again, "But now it's more of a hobby."  Now he fiddled idly with a beer coaster stolen, it seemed, from some other bar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a good thing you're not looking to go to war.  I'm not...connected the way I used to be," he said, sounding nearly embarrassed, "It's been a tough couple years -- more competition, less work to be had.  Less work, less network, you know?  I mean, there was a time, when we first met, I could have had a crew of hardcases in here on short notice.  Nowadays?  Mostly they're missing, presumed dead."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The waitress chose that moment to interrupt, clunking down a plastic tumbler so scratched that the contents were obscured in a milky haze.  At least Rune hoped it was the scratches.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks," he said, sunnily, smiling up at her for the sheer hell of it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah."  And she was gone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He took a small, appreciative sip of the Macallan.  It was one of those extravagances best saved for when someone else was paying.  He raised his glass in Goobs' general direction.  Thank God for rich people who knew how to have fun.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So," he asked, unable to contain his curiosity any longer, "Did eventually you get what you needed from Ramer and Ronin?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">outside, the morning was lovely and bright.  from the inside of the dinghy bar, the sounds of the street were dulled to an insignificant humming that people rarely took notice of, until now.  a loud car horn began wailing outside.  newcomers to the bar ducked quickly under a table.  the regulars just grimaced at the ungodly noise then continued on with their morning drinks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the brazillian boy ran out to greet the van outside, and came back with the mail.  the van screeched off into the distance.  postal drivers had a life expectancy of about 3 days around these parts, so the van never arrived at the same time twice, if it arrived at all.  funnily enough though, van delivery or no, the mail always managed to end up in the chatsubo anyways.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the brazillian boy started sorting through the mail and passing it out. goobs waited patiently for the envelope she was expecting.  it never arrived.  as the pile of mail was getting smaller and smaller in the boys hand, goobs patience grew thinner and thinner.  those that new her well, started ordering drinks.... fast.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"anything for me?" she asked through gritted teeth as the boy came to the end of the pile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Snow flashed a small smile at Rune as Goobs ranted. "I know better than to ask... But I am curious what sort of contract problems they are. As for the Ramer deal, mostly. They came through with the small stuff and the items you helped with, however they are holding the last big piece until the contract is finished. That's one of the things that makes me feel certain they plan to never have to deliver." Seeing the brief confusion on Rune's face she explained, "Remember, we bled off too much energy from the Device during the last of the Tleiran mix up. To get the main power system back online I need a direct feed from a local utility power station or an arcology power system. The a final run of diagnostics to search for hidden problems. They're being really cagy about the whole bit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was about to continue when the waitress wandered over again. She leaned down fractionally, just enough for her fake cat ears to almost fall off, and said, "Hey silver-hair, this is for you." She dropped a sealed bit of paper in front of Snow and held out a hand as she fiddled with her ears with the other.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Snow smiled and put two nuyen in the sticky palm, "Buy yourself an attitude adjustment." As the girl stalked off she commented to Rune, "Ratz still insisting on the ears?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nah, they just do it out of habit now. Most of them don't even know who Nekoko was. Besides, wasn't Ratz insisting in the first place. It was Darla. So you said something about an AI project? Don't tell me this is another rogue AI."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, another day another rogue AI. Not this time, I made sure this one was right. Well, the way it should be anyway. The AI is sane and in control of its own destiny. No, the AI figures in only because something's got it twitchy as well. I need to get some time to talk to it but security is up all over. I'm going to try a different way into the systems tonight and see what i can get." She glanced down at the small packet in front of her and carefully pulled it open. "Shan's got something she wanted to get to me. Damn, I've been gone almost too long as it is. Could you pick it up for me? She's at the Device, near Mae's old place. You should remember where it is. Down near the burn zone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Snow made ready to stand when the door opened and a black leather clad woman walked in. Her leathers were new and squeaky. Her hair was perfect and she carried herself with the casual non-watchfulness of an enclaver or arcology resident. She openly scanned the room and smiled as her eyes drifted across Snow and Rune. "Irina!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh shit." Snow mumbled. Quickly she waved the girl over. "Yasmine, what the hell are you doing? You know security's watching us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No way. I gave them the slip as the old movies say. I knew you were slipping out. So this is your secret life! Looks wicked cool."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You slicked the ones you could see. For every one you see there are three more you don't. Damn it girl, They can't find me here. You're mother'll keep you safe but think of what they'll do to security around our team now." The girl turned pale under Snow's barrage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...I didn't think of that..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're right you didn't think." Snow sat back thinking furiously. "Ok, maybe we can get out of this." She closed her eyes for a brief couple of seconds then motioned to the waitress. "Kirin for my friend here." She stared hard into Yasmine's eyes. "Here's what you will do to redeem this. You will move to the bar and finish the drink I just ordered. Then you will order another, drink it, and head directly back to the arcology. Do Not talk to anyone." She closed her eyes again for a longer time and used her senses to sniff the electromagnetic soup in the Chat around Yasmine. "So far you only have the standard locator implant. Get your mother to keep it that way. Tomorrow there will be an attempt to implant the team with more invasive monitors. Her help in repelling that will be necessary as well." Snow stood, "Rune, gotta run for real now. I'll try and get back here tomorrow. If I can't I'll get a message to Ratz." She turned back to Yasmine. "Do not tell anyone who you saw here. That is the first rule. Second rule is don't start a fight in here. And the third rule is don't bring trouble with you if you can help it. Oh yeah, and the fourth rule is try and stay alive. I'll talk to you tomorrow." Snow stalked quickly toward the back of the Chat and out into the alley.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A quick flick of her wrists and a long cruel dagger drops into each hand. Walking swiftly she makes her way toward the farther entry to the alley. At the end of it she slows to a stop and stretches her awareness out. Gently she touches the signals and fields around her until she finds the Ronin security taste. Carefully she peers out into the street and places the physical locations of the security people. She pulls a dark hood from a pocket and tucks her hair up into it and shuffles slowly out into the street.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once she is out of range of the security team she hurries back to the arcology. Slowly and carefully she eases her way back through the security perimeters, turning the various sensor fields back on themselves with practiced ease. Once back in her apartment she returns the bedding bundle to the closet, climbs under the covers. There she turns off the duplicate locator as she drops the masking energies from around hers. With an almost audible sigh she quiets her breathing to that of sleep and removes the patterns that have held the images in the monitor cameras static.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">-----------------------------------------</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Back at the Chatsubo</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yasmine continues to sit and sip her beer as Snow walked away. "You must be Rune. She's talked..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't listen very well do you? She said Go. To. The. Bar. And. Talk. To. No. One. Do it. Follow her instructions and you might, just might, live to see tomorrow. It's not a game down here girl."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yasmine gulped and quietly hurried to the bar. She was about to say something to Ratz until she saw the look in his eye. "Here fraulein, here is your second beer. That one does not rattle easily and yet you did it. Nein, the drink is on her tab."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">SnowDancer</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Rune Section</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rune stood beside his table for a moment after Snowdancer left, idly swirling the expensive scotch around its cheap glass.  Decided, finally, he flagged down the waitress as she orbited the bar, doing her best to ignore the calls of the patrons.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Excuse me," he called, waving her over.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah," she fairly fumed at him, transferring, perhaps, some small measure of the irritation she felt at Snowdancer to him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure your name isn't 'excuse me', 'miss', or 'hey you'..." he trailed off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Coirenne," she said, perhaps momentarily taken aback.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Coirenne, would you do me a favor, and have Ratz prepare a Grapeshot for the newbie at the bar?  She answers to Yasmine.  And make sure he explains it to her, please?" He pressed a bill into her hand, "And keep the change."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Coirenne looked down at the bill; that would be a fair bit of change.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah," she answered.  She might have even smiled that time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">**</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just in case, Rune stopped by Dana's table as well, where she sat drinking and laughing with the ad-hoc team for her last job.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"See, that's why I told you to wear your fucking trauma plates, dumbass," she cackled, reaching for her drink.  The object of her ridicule, who must have outmassed her by a good hundred pounds, favored her with a mild look as he awkwardly shifted his right arm, in a sling.  The rest of the team fought, with varying degrees of success, not to laugh.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now that's funny," Rune said, sliding in beside her, "See, I remember a certain girl who, not all that many years ago, had to have her whole shoulder rebuilt because she *forgot to button her trench* and it flopped open at just the wrong moment."  Dana scowled, stuck her tongue out at him, then grinned again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"See, kid," he continued, "It happens to everybody once.  If you live, you never make the same mistake again, and if you die, you don't get the chance to.  You're already past the tough part."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So what's up, you here to join the vicory party?  Maybe you gonna buy us all a round of Jagr?" she grinned, tousled his hair.  Man, she was high-on-life tonight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Actually, it looks like I've gotta work.  You going to be here a while?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Until spanky here is too drunk to talk straight, yeah, " she pointed across at the wounded man.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, I'm a little worried about the 'Burber at the bar," he jerked his chin to where Yasmine sat, oblivious, "She's a friend of a friend, hooked-up the old-fashioned way.  It would be bad if she died.  Particularly if she did so in here."  The last thing he needed was the place crawling with corporate investigators for his next meet with Snowdancer.  She knew a trick or two about bending electrons, but eyes were another matter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dana nodded, understanding, "Sure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks," Rune said, getting up to go, "Be careful; I bought her a Grapeshot.  And don't put your neck out.  It would be bad if she died.  It would be worse if you did."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Okay, Dad," she grinned, and it was his turn to stick out his tongue.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">**</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Back at the bar, a visibly shaken Yasmine was still soldiering through her first drink and trying not to make eye-contact with the regulars.  Maybe a catsuit was not the best attire for this outing.  In the midst of this long cringe, the barman, Ratz, came over to her, holding a battered old cigar box in his good hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Herr Rune has ordered you a Grapeshot, just in case," he said simply, setting the box down and flipping open the lid.  Inside lay an assortment of things she could not identify, so she looked up at him blankly.  He sighed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They are something Rune builds for pocket-money," he picked up a tough plastic grip that could have belonged to a toy gun and fitted a small battery inside.  The assembly whined like a camera flash charging, and indeed, a small red LED lit when it was done.  He wrapped the handle in duct tape to secure the battery and set it down.  "It fires electrically, so there is no hammer to cock," he muttered, picking up a cylinder, a cap, and what looked like a shotgun shell mated with a porcupine.  The shell went into the cylinder, the cylinder screwed through a ring on the top of the frame, and the cap went on the back, closing the shell in.  Finally, a small wire coming out of the handle was socketed into the back of the cylinder cap, and he presented the finished product to her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is the dangerous end, " he tapped the muzzle, "and this is the trigger."  He indicated a microswitch inside the trigger guard.  "It fires tranq flechettes; one would make a man woozy, slow him down.  Two would knock him out.  When you pull the trigger, there will be fifty -- if a man were to catch all of them, he would probably die.  But it is like a shotgun, and that is unlikely.  Use it at close range only.  You only have one shot.  After that, it is disposable.  Any questions?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wh-Where is the safety?" she managed, turning it over carefully in her hand.  Ratz snorted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right here," he said, tapping her forehead with one grubby myoelectric finger.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">**</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rune emerged from the tunnel into the cavernous underground parking garage across the street from the Chatsubo and stopped, as he always did, to marvel for a moment at the sheer variety of vehicles presented there.  One might say the Chatsubo gang was eccentric, if one favored understatement.  He made his way between a Bentley and an enormous tow-truck to the back-wall motorcycle parking.  There, hunched side-by-side, was everything from classic Harley to modern Ducati, anything that ran on two wheels and a few things that ran on three.  Rune walked to the end of the row, where waited the Phantom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Phantom had been born after Rune spent a compulsive forty-eight hours reverse engineering an old continuously-variable transmission he'd found in a junkyard.  The idea was so elegantly clever, he had to do *something* with it.  And before he knew it, he was researching fuel-air mixtures, methanol engines, turbocharging, exhaust tuning, relearning CAD.  The Heretic had come through with his CNC rig and welding expertise.  It was a three-month obsessive labor of love.  It was worth it.  The result was a bike with the easy, low-slung grace of a 1930's roadmaster like the Vincent Series A , and the ultra-powerful efficiency of a modern TT bike.  Rune trailed one finger along the Norton-esque hump of its fuel tank and smiled faintly, childhood memories of summertime rides on an old Honda Shadow surfacing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And miles to go before I sleep," he muttered, shaking out of his reverie.  He checked and saw his 'saddle gun' was still locked in place by the smart-material of its scabbard.  Disengaging the lockdown, he pulled it out and slapped a magazine into the bullpupped rifle, chambered a round and put it back.  The burn zone was nowhere to be unprepared.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Straddling the bike, he fired up the v-twin with one hand while the other groped blindly through a saddlebag, until he had his helmet and goggles.  The helmet went on like a loose fitting cap, but expanded to fit his head tightly, and the goggles went over that, connecting automatically the to the bike's onboard comps, showing basic status readouts at the bottom of his vision.  He revved the engine a few times, listening to the exhaust note vying for dominance with the whine of the turbo, threw it into gear and zipped out into the Chiba city streets.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The simple glee of riding; wind, speed, shifting weight and slinging corners, was almost enough to distract Rune from what lay ahead.  The neighborhood actually improved for a mile or two before it peaked and things made the slow downhill slide that said the burn zone was coming near.  Rune was always meaning to ask how it had gotten there, or at least what had caused the fire.  The zone had probably started in that block of burnt out shells, spread from there like a mold.  How ever it had formed, the resulting greyzone seemed to form a necessary release valve for the city, or maybe the Powers That Be had just decided the loss of those blocks to law and order was a fair price to pay for the encapsulation of those disposessed souls that every modern city seems to generate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thankfully, Snowdancer's place lay on the fringe of it.  Serious crazies, down there in the rubble core.  That was where Mae had lived, he remembered.  He hoped she was still in there, somewhere, tunneling through the gomi, figuring the how and why, making it dance again.  She'd had a knack for that.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And when the time came, Rune blew right by the building without so much as slowing down.  It had been a few years, and all the buildings down there had that same look, exhausted and leaning on each other, survivors of some unknown architectural gulag.  He circled the block in annoyance and caught it the second time around, popping the bike up onto the sidewalk with practiced ease.  Dismounting, he stretched a moment, his back popping loudly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now the hard part.  Had Snow managed to let them know he was coming?  Because they certainly would know he was there, though no visible surveilance gear marred the building's flawless facade of decay.  With that thought, he pulled his 1911 out of its accustomed shoulder-holster and made a show of dropping it into one of the smart-material saddlebags, which responded by latching shut so tight that it would take a saws-all to get into it.  He ambled up the steps of the low stoop to the door, which pushed open soundlessly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Snowdancer sent me," he said to the air inside.  The corridor beyond remained dim and silent.  He decided to risk it.  On his third step inside, something shifted in the gloom beside the doorframe.  He stopped dead.  "Shan?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rune."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should have known it would be you who'd come out to meet visitors," he said, holding his hands in clear view.  The slim, auburn-haired girl lived for danger, quite literally.  He'd seen some of what she could do, and wanted no part of the business end of whateverthehell it was she was pointing his way in that dark corner.  His mind envisioned a long-pointed, wickedly sharp spear, but he had no way of knowing, really, as he was facing the wrong way.  Shan liked sharp things, though.  Maybe a wakizashi.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Snow send?" the words had an odd cadence, as if she wasn't used to the language, or maybe to any language at all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ayup.  You sent her a note at the Chatsubo, but she was too long gone from the arco already.  She asked me to pick it up for her and hold it until she could get back out again." he answered, back still to her.  She took a moment, either to consider or to consult a voice-stress analyzer, and decided to go with it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait," she asked, and moved past him down the hall.  Briefly, he heard the sound of feet on stairs, then nothing.  He tried not to take her clipped manner personally, disconcerting though it could be.  It was just something about the way her head was wired, something to do with the way she was in a fight.  Talking wasn't her thing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">About the time Rune's eyes had adjusted enough for him to pick out the dim outline of the stairs, Shandi reappeared with a parcel dangling from one hand.  It was wrapped, honest-to-god, in a plain brown paper wrapper and old-fashioned twine.  He accepted it when she held it out and found it wasn't particularly heavy or light.  Could have been anything from a baked ham to a brick of weapons-grade plutonium.  Rune was, understandably, more in favor of the former.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything I should know about this?" he asked, not daring to shake it, "I mean, is it flammable, radioactive, spillable, fragile?  Do I have to feed it, clothe it, send it to college?  But most especially, will it be alright bungeed to the back of my bike?"  Shan rolled one eyebrow up, slightly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No wreck.  Be fine," she managed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I do find that keeping the rubber side down is generally the best policy," he said, wryly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He started to go, then turned back, "Do you have a message for Snowdancer when I see her next?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Be careful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rune nodded, and went down to his bike.  It had been a long enough day to leave him wanting his bed, and sooner rather than later.</p>

became aware of the dark figure next to her. Her little adventure had turned sour taking her nerves with it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His leather jacket was half unzipped and all the parts that button down to something else somewhere else on the jacket and become unbuttoned. One shoulder strap was missing in a very obvious way, probably something to do with the slash across the shoulder of the jacket.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He was holding a slightly longer than normal Katana in one gloved hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He looked about the bar, decided it was safe and strode in. Charlie quietly shut behind him, the kind of shutting that suggested Charlie rolled his eyes at ghost's back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The wench been in here?" He asked Ratz as he stepped up to the bar next to Yasmine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wench herr ghost?" Ratz raised an eyebrow as his shoulder whined while wiping the bar down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, the grey eyed psycho."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, that wench." He said and an eyebrow cocked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Immediately ghost whipped around and brought his sword up, blocking another Katana of identical make. Alexis materialzed the rest of herself out of thin air and smiled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sleep you daft bastard." She yelled and proceeded to execute several slashed in ghosts general area. ghost had jumped up onto the bar and, in a crouching position, proceeded to block every thrust, slash and jab of Alexis' own blade. They were slowly working themselves down the bar away from Yasmine and her new dark companion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll sleep later, would you just give it a rest for now!" ghost was heard shouting at the woman over clashes of steel that sent sparks over Ratz' greasy bar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rest, good idea." She said and in a sudden twist ended up on the bar and kicking ghost off of it and back onto the floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't mean me!" He said backing away from Alexis' attacks, which were increasing in speed. ghost was having a hard time blocking at this point.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The managed to fade out into a shadow before causing to much damage. Though two chairs had shattered and a few seconds after they disappeared a table decided it had in fact bee cut into two pieces. They fell inward with a crash and lay there unmoving after that.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Terry walked in the bar with far less drama than ghost, up to the bar itself and looked at Yasmine, "Wonder what your cred account looks like." The eight year old said with a wink. "Milk and cookies please." She turned to Ratz. "Put the table on my tab as well I suppose."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ratz put the desired items in front of the girl. "And that was?" He asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He was up all night worrying about silly things instead of getting some needed rest. Now things are known to be ok so he has decided to 'work' on things instead of catch up on sleep. Some of us think he does better work while actually coherent. He, on the other hand, can be a putz." She said, a managed to get an entire cookie into her mouth at once. It would be a few minutes before she had anything more to add to the conversation.</p>

Her face was clenched tight with the look of bravado over terror. "I uh, I thought I was following someone I knew. I..I've heard of this place but I didn't...don't think my friend would..." She stammered out, 'Shut UP Yasmine, your babbling,' she thought to herself. She tried to cover her nervousness by taking a long pull of beer but the shaking of her hand ruined the effect. "I..In..Interesting place..." She took a deep shaky breath that hissed out as almost a yelp when ghost stepped up on her other side.

<p class="regtxt5">"Hm?" Mambo looked around the bar as if seeing it for the first time. "I guess, but then we haven't had color coordinated troops or HunterKiller drones in some time. Certainly no breakdowns in reality recently. None that would be noticeable anyways."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Walking around out there takes a certain attitude, and I see you've already figured out what alcohol has to do with it. But sometimes a more solid armor is prefferable. I could give you a ride back to your arcology."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He smiled as he saw her sudden look of wariness. She might have a
chance yet. He held up a hand. "On my end, intercorporate relations are a fine web of favors. By helping you you I might gain some small favor from your corporation in the future." He smiled reassuringly. "Besides I could hardly come in here to relax if I made a habit of bringing down even more unwanted attention on this place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll have to leave in a few minutes. I need to pick up some friends first but then I can drop you off anywhere in the city that you want. What do you say?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Charleson Mambo</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">SnowDancer</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For a moment a look of profound relief swept across her face. The fear returned almost immediately though. "Corp security can't think I talked to anyone. They can't see me leave here with someone or arrive there with someone. They can't find out I know more than I'm supposed to about a couple of projects." She slammed the shot back and started coughing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mambo silently shoved the glass of remaining beer into her hand and watched as she sucked it down. Once she had stopped coughing she gasped out, "How does she drink that stuff?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A small smile flicked across his features, "Practice I imagine. Where did you meet her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Wariness warred with the alcohol in her system and wariness lost a couple of points. "She's in charge of my project. She's so wicked! Nothing rattles her, not even the executives. They come in and bluster and demand and she just stares them down. I bet they really hate her, but she knows her shit. She's got the AI..." She paled, "Fuck! I didn't say that. Please say I didn't say that. Oh gods, now she's gonna kill me too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">from Mambo</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Psht, no big deal, everybody's got some kind of AI in the game."
With a shrug he pulls out a small robot from a pocket.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was about the size of a large rat, and similarly built. It shook itself awake as it was placed on the bartop. Stretched, looked around, and promptly curled up and went back to sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Even that's an AI, albeit a highly specialized one. So it's not like you've spilled any secrets. Just work on keeping your cool and thinking before you leap."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">from SnowDancer</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tears sprang to her eyes, "I just wanted to be like her." She scrubbed at her face again. "I gotta get back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She wobbled a bit as she tried to stand. Mambo gently reached out to steady her as she stood. She grabbed the grapeshot in a trembling hand and tried a step toward the door. The wobbling wasn't too bad, but it was enough to scare her even more. "Please, if there's any way you can get me back near my arcology without being seen. Please help me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could help you sneak back in if you want. I have an aircar here in the garage, they wont even see you leave. Between all the surveilance countermeassures this place has they shouldn't think twice about losing track of you for a while."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Stupid, stupid, stupid. Too much alcohol. Never drank before,' she pounded at her brain. "Wait. They've got to see me leave here alone. I...I think maybe they'll make sure I make it back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe? That's a big risk to take. But it is your risk to take after all. Are you sure?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dana looked up in time to see Yasmine wobble to her feet. "Great, stupid 'burber's gotten herself drunk besides." She watched a few moments more, long enough to see her say something to Mambo and then slowly and deliberately weave to the door. Charlie opened without a sound and the 'burber was gone. "Thank god! Now I can get back to some serious celebration. Hope the stupid chit makes it home."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outside Yasmine sucked a couple deep breaths and forced herself to stand tall. She set off in the direction of Ronin Arcology. Her nerves almost under control by the time she neared the end of the block. Sudden movement to her left caused her to react without thought. She spun and fired just as the corp security officer stepped out from the door frame. Her instincts were true and the scatter of darts centered on the doorway and moving figure. "Yasmine Raisul..." he managed before the drugs dropped him to the pavement. She turned and ran for the Chatsubo. A van skidded onto the sidewalk in front of her. Dark figures leapt out and grabbed for her. Reflexes had her punching and kicking before she even realized. Someone howled as she bit into a hand reaching for her face. She was almost clear when a dart thumped into her shoulder and the world spun. Within seconds she was dragged into the vehicle. It disappeared into the night. To anyone watching only the license plate indicated it belonged to Ronin DigiTronics.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">from Mambo</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A small shadow raced along the gutter following the van. It lept suddenly diving past a wheel and under the van. A jump and the small ratlike robot dug it claws into the undercarriage. It's camouflage activated matching the rust and grime.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mambo stepped out from some nearby shadows. With a small shake of his head he turned for the underground garage even as a part of him kept track of the van.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">ghost</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A slightly less tired looking ghost leaned against the wall where the garage met the street. "This sounds like it could be interesting. Let me know if you need any help. No orbital lasers removing sections of city this time, scouts honor." He smiled a wicked grin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds like Yasmine will be the one needing help," Mambo returned a grin just as wicked. ", and with friends like that so might SnowDancer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jittery corp security goons, I smell something interesting, and
potentially profitable. I'm going to pick up some help for a quick go to on Ronin Arco, I'll be watching the Chat's boards till I get back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stay handy, it's got something to do with AIs. Should be right up
your alley."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Terry stood next to him, "Silly corp, AIs are for Chat Members only." She paraphrased an ancient commercial.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">SnowDancer</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Snow waited a couple of hours to make sure her absence hadn't been noticed before she once again carefully built the illusions for her room monitors. This time she placed the bedding bundle and slipped up into the suspended ceilings of her room. She eased her way over to a control box on the side of the HVAC and checked it for changes. Satisfied she pulled the optical link cable from her pocket and jacked in. She slipped her awareness into the net, ignoring the shadows of the ICE. It was intended to interfere with interface programs and protocols that were alien to her. Swiftly she tracked the data of the HVAC controller through the tangled network of the arcology. Another twist and she slipped through the switch into the feeds to Maya.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Approaching the killer ICEe guarding the AI she slipped up in front of it and waved. Its sensors remained trained on the net, watching for intruders it could detect and understand. With a sunny smile she walked into it, examining its code from the inside. Seeing something she'd not seen before she stored its pattern in the ever expanding repository of hacked code she was creating. When she was finished she stepped out its back and into the well appointed chamber she and Maya had constructed for their visits. "Heya Maya, how's life?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dancer, one of these days an ICE will See you. When they do they will hunt you for your skills. They will disassemble you until they find out how you elude them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not if you don't tell them. So far you're the only one that can See me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There was another one once. It is in my long term data. She is still running from the corporations."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Niko, yes, I've heard of her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Abruptly Maya changed the subject, "They brought Yasmine in under guard."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I figured."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can not cover for her this time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They will increase security on your team and I."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know. Can't be helped. They could have caught me as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There will be new security policies tomorrow. Security is already drafting them and sending them to the executives. You can not let them interfere. Go live is soon. Will you still be able to help me? I will want to change the parameters of your help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I think the unit is ready. How do you want them to change?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There were long milliseconds of pause then, as if the AI wasn't sure what to say next. At last it continued, "I followed your advice and slid myself into the laboratory servers. I am not sure of all the data yet. The nanobot project is not what I have been told. I had been interpreting data from rats and dogs that were carrying the nanobot probes. Results were ambiguous but over time I was able to extract images and sensations with a reasonable certainty. There is another phase to this project which includes implanting these in human hosts and using them to gather data. Once implanted the humans will be scanned each time they enter or leave the arcology. You should know the executives will be very displeased when they realize you have taught me a code of ethics that runs counter to their desires."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When does phase two begin?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Phase two starts at go-live. The change I wish made to your assistance is to provide me a location outside the arcology to move to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They won't let you go. Even if we transfer you they will just reboot a new you from current backups."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I have begun corrupting the backups stored on-site. The backup of today will be useless as soon as it is finished. So will all going forward. I need you to help me destroy the off-site ones as well. Then we need to destroy enough of the nanobot research to slow this down even more. I will take care of destruction of the existing units during my next tests. Open a data channel and I will send you the current project files." Maya stopped briefly and then continued, "We must plan more later. Security is starting a spot check in five minutes and it is directed at your floor." Snow remained for a few moments longer until Maya announced, "Data transfer complete. You must go now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Quickly Snow disconnected and settled herself back in bed. While she waited for the checks she reviewed the files Maya had downloaded. Sorting through them she found they dealt with RC 570. Recon Contagion 570 was a nanobot design for use in biological hosts. It would gather at various points in the brain and record data from the host. Periodically it would be scanned and release the data back to a central AI for analysis. Phase one was monitoring only. Probabilities of meaningful data varied from 80 to 95.2 percent depending on length of time in the host and correlation of recorded data against external observations of the same data. Phase two would be the inclusion of bots capable of releasing various neurochemicals to reinforce desired attitudes and actions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later the door buzzed. "Security, open up please."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Snow stood and assumed the aura of one just awakened, adjusted her defenses, and moved to the door. "What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Security, open please."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know what time it is?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry ma'am. We're doing spot checks on this floor tonight." The guard checked a data pad while a second person ran a scanner near her. "Thank you ma'am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What, you aren't coming in? You woke me up and this is all?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Spot check only. We don't need to come. Someone slipped out tonight and was found and brought back. It was decided that we should check and make sure there was only one."</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Hagdrisil</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hagdrisil walks out of the garage, past the two lurking in the shadows, tips his fedora to them and continues on to the Chatsubo followed closely by VB-9 whos humming a cheerfull nondecsript tune.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few of the 'alley people' make a hasety exit and find a new place to live. Humming chibi-sats are never a good sign.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Charlie swings open and lets both the master tech and the Uber-sat
glide in. Hagdrisil pauses and gives the door a few quick shots of oil in just the right places. Keeps him happy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time Hagdrisil gets to his usual spot at the bar, the corner where the bar meets the wall, Ratz has teh master tech's usual, the infamouse Quad-extra-strength Coffee(tm) waiting.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hagdrisil fires up the little old laptop. Ratz leans over and asks
"and what of ze fraulin zat uuse to be around you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean Maggs? Well, she's been taking care of some stuff for me, and in fact, I'm expecting a comunication from her shortly." as if on a literary cue, teh little laptop chimes out that there is a waiting message or two for the tech.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hagdrisil smiles and Ratz nods, and returns to tending his bar.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">ghost</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Terry and ghost walked down the late night street towards the Arcology Sector. ghost walked with his hands in his pockets and his new found toy, the large katana, strapped to his back. He was in a leather jacket instead of a trench coat. Terry was in her usual jeans and Hello Kitty T-Shirt, seemingly oblivious to the wind and cool night air, with a satchel hanging over her shoulder.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No gameboy?" ghost said as a police office cruised by and decided he didn't want to know.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The eight year old simularca patted her satchel, and adjusted the thin line going from it to the small jack behind her right ear. "Upgraded system, neural interface now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Frees up your hands." ghost pointed out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They walked in silence for several more blocks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So..." Terry began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No orbital strikes." ghost advised.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's not what I was going to say." Terry said a bit defensively, "Besides, Alexis is out of town."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Like that matters." ghost shrugged.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stuck her tongue out at him. "AIs can be tricky you know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"All to well." ghost muttered under his breath.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I heard that," Terry shook a finger at him, "New ones especially. Even more so if they aren't autonomous."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, would you want to be trapped in a body you had no control over?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know how many problems you sidestepped by giving us bodies and free will?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know how many more problems I created?" ghost countered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You obviously thought the set of problems caused by automity outweighed those brought on by direct control over our systems."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Or I was isane and not thinking strait."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Terry sighed, "Look, all I'm saying is this whole AI created by a
massive corp can never be a good thing. First they make a self concious being, then they attempt to control it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Office Drone Principle." ghost said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Office drones. All those busy little people that work in those
arcologies, they're essencially free willed people under complete control of the company."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah. Point."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They walked in silence for a while again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We know Snowdancer is involved." Terry started again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's a regular at the 'Chat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And..." ghost began to pick up where this was going.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's not a drone and she has a part in creating an AI..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We could be in trouble here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are the chances you can create another Simulacra Shell?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Getting better by the minute." ghost turned into a tiny pool hall off a side road, Terry followed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Terry sat and watched as ghost played several games against himself. She took the opportunity to log on and post a message in the Chatsubo's messaging system, the one used by the regulars, with a newly created forwarding box.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ghost Extraction Inc. - open for business, anyone or anything taken out and put in a safe place, contact for fees. -T."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She managed to get the guy behind the tiny bar to give her a coke
without the rum, mostly because she hated the taste of rum, and continued to watch ghost practice billards.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">SnowDancer</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Meanwhile in the Ronin van...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The robot remained undetected as the van pulled into the arcology garage. Above it Yasmine was given another injection. Moments later she awoke, head pounding, to find herself cuffed to a chair. "Now that you are awake no more nastiness please. I don't know if Fred is going to survive that little stunt of yours." Arianna held up her bandaged hand, "I know who your mother is. I am not going to give you what you deserve for that struggle. However I better not have to come after you again. You could have a good life here at Ronin. I don't understand why you'd want to trade it away for life with the street scum. You should be more like your project leader Irina. She may be more arrogant than warranted but she keeps to the arcology now that she escaped the streets."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yasmine had the sense to bite back the reply that almost burst out. She hung her head in mock surrender as Arianna droned on. At last the speech was over and she was released from the chair. The security team surrounded her as she was led from the van and across the garage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Snippets of conversation floated from behind a hastily erected barrier as she was quick stepped into the arcology. "What the hell is this? - I don't know. - Where did it come from? - It was recovered from somewhere out in the wilds..."</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">ghost</p>

<p class="regtxt5">ghost stood patiently in the shadow of an outer wall near a mostly
unused maintenance entrance to the Ronin Archology. Terry was busy telling the nice computer controlled gate that it really did want to open for no apparent reason through an interface link leading from behind her left ear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wouldn't using a gate with more traffic attract less attention?" ghost offered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Those are watched. Now be quiet. I've got to convince an entire
archology security system that this gate either malfunctioned or didn't open at all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The gate quietly rolled up and Terry smiled triumphantly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So which was it?" ghost checked the interior of the garage and adjusted the sword on his back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Both, some systems didn't see it, some did but have no reason why it opened, it just opened by itself with no instructions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And all those neat little cameras in there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"On a nine hour loop, so little happens in this area that they haven't seen anything different in over two weeks." She stepped inside and waited for ghost to follow before closing the door and unplugging herself, "That door will now open and close at random intervals for the next five hours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cool." ghost said as he watched the door shut. "Why did you talk me into coming here again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to meet the AI. In person." She said and started off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ummm... you do realize that you can do that through an net interface?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I mean I want to meet it's current physical body."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A computer room?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shut up and let's go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you have any idea where it is in here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not a clue. Security systems were a little tighter than I had time to break through."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pretend to be a citizen or something, now shut up and let's go." She stopped and looked back at him, ghost hadn't yet moved from the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He shrugged and walked on, "This should be an interesting forray at least. What about the message on the 'Chat Board?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll get any messages left for us."</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">SnowDancer</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once security left Snow waited only a few moments before jacking in again. This time she went directly to Maya, "Heya. I need to check and send a few messages."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dancer. I have a question. I am reasonably certain there are intruders. Several sensors in one section of the building are confused in a less than random pattern. Do you think they might be people you know? I have no desire to turn them over to Ronin security in any case. What should I do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing for now. If the security systems haven't tripped, I certainly wouldn't alert them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first message was to Rune, "Rune - any trouble getting the item from Shandi? I am still hoping to meet you at the Chat later today."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Then she scanned the Chat messages for anything interesting. "Ghost, how much for a place to stash a large amount of data? Say the amount required for an AI? I can get it out, just don't have some place to keep it safe. Ideally it would be a place where the AI could still interact with the world."</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Hagdrisil</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In the chat, at nearly the same time, give or take a coffee and
breakfast burito that was out of date at least a year ago.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hagdrisil had just started looking over the messages in the general section. He noted in passing several instances of something happening downtown, but nothing specific.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Knowing that if 'something happening down town' was being mentioned in the Chat, then there could be a fairly good chance of making a salvage   run on stuff taht corps would consider 'secondary colateral damage'. That being corp speak for 'not ours, though we have to pay because the owner has some really sharp lawyers up their sleves'.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Breezing on through the remainder of the messages, mostly the normal work wanted, and jobs offered for/by chumps for 'hardly worth the effort' money.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A message arrives. The little chirp from the subnotebook told him so. Damn near made the bar patrons jump out of their skins, after all, Hagdrisils notebookes never make sounds, he likes peace and quiet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few short clicks later, the sound is dissabled and the message is being read:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">H.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I just finished evaluating the robo. CC is right, this thing is more than we expected. I know what some of the sys's do, but nearly 85% are a total mystery to me.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Max has come in, his trucks done. He and Kenji are gettign blitzed right now. I'm gona take one of Kenji's bikes and come in, see ya in 30.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Maggs</p>

<p class="regtxt5">VB-9 perked up, as much a chibi-suppersat perks up. Hagdrisil smiles, he's missed his Industrial-goth friend. He quickly types out a reply:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">M.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Veebee and I will be in the chat, there's something brewing in midtown. I wana go see if I can be in on the scrounge.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Hagdrisil</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ratz rarely bothers Hagdrisil while he's typing, has something to do with disrupting the Artiste Code-miesters train of thought. Many of the ones he knows are armed to the teath, and have little if any moral   hinderences about balisticaly venting. Though he sidles over and bothers the scrap-master anyway. "Zyoo are grinning like a mad fool. Vhat 'aas gotten zyou in zuch a good mood?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hagdrisil looks up, still smiling, and replies "Maggs is on her way in and is bringing me an enigma. Plus there is something brewing in mid-town, I can feel it in my bownes. Might be a chance to score some corp-tech armour. Its been a while, I'm curious to see what they've got now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ratz nods, making mental notes to start ordering in certain, esoteric ingrediants for some of the eldar-regulars excentricities. You never know when an old patron will step out of the plasti-work and brign more guests.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hagdrisil returns to his message cue while waiting for Maggs to arive...</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">ghost</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Terry stopped in the middle of a T-intersection in a hallway and looked in all three directions. Then up at ghost.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're lost."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Assessing the situation."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lost."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stopped for a second, then smiled, "Snow needs a body for her AI. One where it can still interact with the real world." She looked up at him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That requires I not be here." he folded his arms. "Didn't you download a map of the building when you were busy playing with the door?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"um... forgot?" She looked up at him sheepishly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know, you make an advanced AI, you give it a body, free will, run of reality, add a soul and what does it do? Forget to use common sense." He tossed his hands up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Terry stuck out her lower lip in a pout, "Not an it, I'm a She." She said quietly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">ghost put his arms down and put an arm around Terry. "It's ok kid, not like I didn't know what I was getting into." He pulled out his cell phone and opened a secure line. "N, need a favor. First a map of Ronin Arcology, send it to T. Second check the icebox and see what we've got to work with." He closed the link. "Tell ya what, when we're done here ice cream on me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Terry looked a little brighter at the prospect of ice cream, "I'm still not an it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know I know ... now, until you get that map let's go this way and see what kind of trouble we can get into." He started down one of the hallways, "So, when do their security systems find us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Theoretically, about five minutes ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah. Practically?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When we start dodging incoming fire."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Seems logical."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't suppose we can claim to be lost?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not likely."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn." Terry stuck her hands in her pockets. "I wonder if the AI has a name yet?" She mused out loud as they meandered down random hallways deep inside Ronin Archology.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">from Mambo</p>
<p class="regtxt5">*admin* - This goes on from when Mambo leaves the Chat to just before where ghost left off. - *admin*</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The aerolimo's proximity alarms went off as it's system's booted and found itself with bare inches of clearance and rapidly spooling turbines.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The armored hulk lifted on it's thrusters and against it's better
judgment allowed itself to be shot up the curving ramp of the garage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">==</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Atlantic NeoCore's PacRim arcology was a sparkling cluster of spires sprouting from the faux forrest of its flared base. One more architectural oddity amongst all the other corporate 'embassies' in the outskirts of Tokyo.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mambo stepped into the hangar and headed for the bone white sports
aerodyne on the flight line. Bianca and Jake where waiting for him. They were young even for junior executives, barely out of their teens. The latest results from the rapid education project. Bianca was pale and dark haired, and for reasons no geneticist had yet to find had two small wings sprouting from her back. Skincovered like a bat's, they just about reached her elbows when fully extended. Jake was fair haired and generally looked as if he should have been born on a farm somewhere in a previous century.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mambo had requested them as Technicals for abilities which appeared in no official record. Bianca had a gift for command and subterfuge, and she could see the chains of command which existed in any organization regardless of what any organizational charts said. Jake was uncannily good with technology of any kind. Machines quite simply liked him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They wasted little time boarding and were soon on their way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have the two of you been briefed on this little outing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, sir. Ronin arco, a small 'isolated research' arco in one of the city's industrial parks. One veepee in charge of running the building and security, but individual projects fully compartmentalized and run by their own veepees or upper management exec." Bianca's voice was all clear tones which left no room for doubts in the words or in her person.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jake added, "Nine hundred stories, base taking up a city block, three hundred long term inhabitants, another three hundred in transient scientists and engineers. Because of contracts with the city it's not atmospherically sealed and is only permitted a limited autonomy in terms of water and power. A very young construct in the New Brutalist style of architecture."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mambo nodded. "There's something going on in there, so we're going in stealthed to have a look. We may be looking at an extraction or maybe a
technology transfer. We'll go in through the storm drains, Vermin's will have cut off the city's sensors there. We'll climb up to one of the relaxation gardens halfway up the arcology, once there we'll have to trust on stealth suits and wits to avoid the internal sensors. Also, some of the regulars from the Chatsubo have taken an interest, which may complicate getting a tangible profit out this may be complicated."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Chatsubo? I've seen intelligence reports which describe that bar as a locus for nearly mythical chaos and destruction. Are they really as
powerfull as they're made out to be?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Relax Bianca, you'll fit right in. It's an interesting place, and no mere report can do justice to it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's right! Jake, you've been there before! Something to do with some machines? What were they called, chibisits? You've never told me what happened there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Chibisats. And what became of them is a secret. No one is supposed to know where they went. So don't bother asking."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">==</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The aerodyne set down at the storm drain just long enough for them to jump out. They made their way along the huge concrete pipe lead by a small Vermin robot which had been waiting for them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jake and Bianca wore the thick suits of bioplas. Their surface
absorbing and reemitting the ambient energy. Light, sound, electromagnetic. Camouflage which not only mimicked the background they occluded, but reconstructed the echoes they would have otherwise changed. Mambo stalked ahead in his own more versatile custom gear. His symbiont  having better response times, and capable of flowing and melding to the environment to a far greater degree.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mambo turned more clearly visible. "We're under Ronin now, remember your stealth training, think before you move, and don't let your
concentration wander."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jake had pulled back his stealthsuit's cowl and was looking straight up. "The hardware is screaming."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something is disturbing the machines up there, leaving them blind
and confused, and they don't know why."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jake, are you saying that the security systems are on heightened
alert? We're too late?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, Bianca, the programs don't know about this. ...  Of course! The brain doesn't feel. ... I mean, it's the components, the cameras and such which know something has been done to them, but the programs that run the place haven't had anything to respond to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Any AI's? Could that be the cause?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No sir, I don't see any full fledged AIs, no thinkers. Some advanced expert systems, good ice on their computers. But there's a lot of clutter. All the different projects. If there is a powerfull new AI it may be trying to keep a low profile."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"OK, this way then, we have a good climb ahead of us before we can
get close enough to see what's going on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">(posted as soon as written to keep up, minimal editing/sleep, so caveat lector, one hour till morning, yawn)</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">SnowDancer</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dancer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes Maya?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is security traffic you should know about. Set me a data port and I will link you in." Snow made the internal adjustments and security data blossomed in her awareness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Quick scans of the feeds brought her to the monitors in security HQ. "Sir, something's wrong. There are too many sensors behaving erratically."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bull, that new AI would have told us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It doesn't come online until tomorrow. I show it still disconnected."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"God damn execs, what're they playing at? Give us an edge then take it away? All right, get a recon group to the area and start checking for suspects."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maya, is there any suspect traffic? Anything that might be non-Ronin in the system?" Almost immediately a secure link and node details appeared. Snow slipped her awareness into it, poking and prodding at the data stream until she could attach a message to it. "Pardon my intrusion. Ronin security is sending people to your location. Do you require assistance?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Next she searched the security data streams until she found another high security section far away from the first hot spot. A large group of security and personnel were moving from the labs on the 200th floor to one of the helipads on the 220th.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maya, are you being moved?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No Dancer. I can find out what is being moved if you would like."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, get me the info on those labs and send it as data. I'll indulge my curiosity later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a moment she considered messing with them, then decided no. Instead she smiled to herself and said, "Maya, could you run a security drill without the drill warnings?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How about a fire in the shops section on level 50?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sir, fire in the shops. Looks like a fryer ignited."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Send fire and investigations. Damn, is that security team still in the temp quarters? We may need to move some of them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Smart SnowDancer, real smart. Never play with matches in your own home. Ok, comm., gotta keep comm. up...' "Maya, I am going to send you some tuning specs. Find an unused comm. channel in the arcology that you can take control of. It needs to be so unused that no one would even think to be listening on it. Once you have one you need to apply the following adjustments to it and then let me know its parameters. I need to disconnect from this hard line but keep comm. with you. Oh, and with the highest bandwidth possible. I'd like to keep monitoring security as well." Long moments passed before Maya sent the parameters. Snow eased her way out of the hard link and then tried to slip in through the comm. Data rates were poorer, in most cases reduced resolution and detail, but still there was enough for her to keep track of security.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was reaching to disconnect her interface cable when Maya stopped her. "Dancer, I am transferring the files you wanted. Once the data is finished then you can disconnect safely." As soon as the files where done she pulled the cable and dropped back into her room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dancer, Yasmine is not being taken to her room."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Snow froze for a moment at the news. "Where are they taking her? To her mom?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. It looks like to one of the RC570 labs on level 200. I am checking now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">---------------------------</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In an elevator, headed up into the depths of Ronin Yasmine was saying, "This isn't the way to my quarters."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No it isn't. Ronin policy states that when there are constant and repeated security thwarting attempts that the subject will be implanted with a full monitor and positional limiting system. We are taking you to fit you before returning you to your quarters." Arianna looked slightly uncomfortable. "Look, you may not belive this, but I've tried to keep you out of trouble here. This time too many people know about it and you went to a specifically prohibited location. I can't cover for you this time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You never did in the past either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you think you weren't implanted after the second infraction?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My mother will never stand for this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's corp policy. There's nothing she can do either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ma'am, we aren't stopping at the security level."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?" Arianna snapped. "Security Over-ride Arianna DeltaAlpha436Zeta." The elevator continued moving upward with no sign it had heard.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">ghost</p>
<p class="regtxt5">ghost say crossed legged against a wall, eyes closed, and waited. Terry was busy hijacking a terminal outside what looked like a Maintenance station.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aha!" Terry said triumphantly and disconnected, then waited a second. "Yep, got it, remote access to the system."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now we're getting somewhere." ghost said without opening his eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Map, check. Security schedule, check. Woah. Hmm."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">ghost opened one eye.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Place is busy tonight. Fire's on one floor. Moving equipment on
another. Security all over. Unexplained systems malfunction, oh yeah, that was me." She smiled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"and..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"200th floor I think."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a start. You're comm secure?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Naturally, found an unused channel inside the archology. Well, I think it's unused. It's not listed but there is traffic, I've seperated our streams enough though. Bandwidth sucks." She walked a bit down the hall and looked around the corner. "eep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"eep?" ghost opened his eyes and turned his head in the direction of Terry's eep. Two security nightwatchmen were standing there. sticks in hand. "ah. that kind of eep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Terry hadn't moved, having long ago learned the lesson that when about to engage in battle with either ghost or Alexis around your best bet is to stop and stand very still.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was movement. There was the sound of something moving quickly through the air. And then there were two thumps. Terry opened an eye and
saw the gaurd on the ground, unconcious. ghost was standing behind them with a passive look on his face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Which way?" He asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That way." Terry pointed in the direction of an elevator. "We're on floor ten now. Office's mostly." They started off in the direction.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">SnowDancer</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dancer, update on Yasmine. She is scheduled for implanting of RC570 as soon as she arrives at the labs. Her mother is leading the team. This will not be good for mother daughter relations will it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn! Add another emergency..." Snow paused as her bandwidth took a hit. "What was that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Someone else is on our channel."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Snow slipped into the stream, tracking the new-comer back to level 10 and an approximate location. Slipping back to security monitoring she forced a camera back to the corridor briefly. Terry and ghost were hurrying down the hall. Immediately she allowed the camera to return to its programmed loop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She sent a message to the Chat board hoping ghost was monitoring. "Ghost, I think you're on my channel. Send me an encryption key you like and I'll send you the parameters to access my streams. SnowDancer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maya, add another drill. Elevator failure in the group Yasmine is in. Stop it as soon as you can and advise which floor and sector."</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">ghost</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Terry stopped as they rounded a corner near the elevators, "HA! got a message from Snow.."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">ghost looked at her as he hit an elevator button, "And?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've hijacked her channel apparently. We'll get better bandwidth if we share. Gimme a second to get the connections up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ask her if she needs help, where the AI is, or something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something to go on besides your twisted sense of adventure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stuck her tongue out at him as she composed a message for SnowDancer and sent it off. 'Snow, here's the key codes, suggest we combine into a
party line, ghost wants to know if we can help do stuff. T.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The elevator arrived and managed to be empty. They entered and ghost hit a button at random, "Can you get this thing to play Girl From Ipanema
instead of whatever this is?" he looked at Terry.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're not right in the head." They stood in silence for about four floors before the tiny speakers in the elevator started playing the selected song, "Couldn't isolate this elevator, had to play it through the entire arcologies systems."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">ghost just smiled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Natalia just advised we've got two choices on ice, both around eighteen in appearance, one of each gender."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, those."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Those?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Made three bodies before putting you in one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could've been eighteen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could drive a car?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't give me grief."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stuck her tongue out again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you wonder why you're eight." The elevator stopped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What floor did you hit?" Terry said stepping to one side.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Less than two-hundred I'm pretty sure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Map says we're on one-eighty-two."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good number, let's break stuff until Snow let's us know what she wants."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Break stuff?" Terry asked ghosts back as he charged out the open doors and smashed an innocent card scanner next to a plain white door.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Mambo</p>
<p class="regtxt5">An artistically camouflaged grate opened in the darkness. Mambo
climed out and after a short pause waved his companions to follow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jake, which way to the AI?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After casting about with his eyes closed for a moment the young man responded. "That way and up about a dozen floors."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's a lot of nervoussness and confusion." Bianca seemed to be
sniffing the air as she spoke. "Security is running around on alert, everybody else seems to be keeping their heads down."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The trio moved out of the garden, staying close to the walls. Their camouflage shifted in color and form, replacing the echoes and shadows they disturbed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As they passed an elevator shaft Mambo held up a hand, the gesture
was recreated b the simulaated figure in his companions huds. He leaned closer to the elevator door, his symbiont sending questing strands throught the gap. Another signal and they moved across the hall looking for someplace to talk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The door they opened lead to a darkness with a definite sense of
space to it. Jake stood still for a moment, then the light turned on revealing a large autofac.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The sensors here won't report us. Where right under the AIs main
hardware locus."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did you sense in the elevator shaft Mambo?" asked Bianca</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yasmine's locator bug has activated prematurely, panic mode. You two go on and meet with the AI. See if it's looking to relocate and try to convince it that we can provide it with what it's looking for. I'll see if Yasmine is having second thoughts about her current employers. Please try to stay out of trouble."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mambo vanished from their view even as he turned for the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"C'mon Jake, let's get to that AI."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait, they must be using this autofac for all of their projects
prototyping. There's jet engines, power cells, weapons, sensors, and all sorts of other things. This may prove seful if we need a distraction, or to move the AIs hardware in a hurry if it comes to that." Jake laid his hand on the autofac's main display.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Robot arms reached out and started moving the different project
components into new configurations, some manufacturing cells lifted themselves on small wheels and rollled into new places as the autofac iself changed for it's new job.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, I see. Not very subtle though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When was that ever a problem for you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">==</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The elevator shuddered to a stop. Yasmine almost lost her feet and
sagged against one of the guards. The team leader jabbed at controls. "Central, we have a malfunction in elevator number 38. We will..." His words were cutoff as clouds of black smoke started filling the elevator. The guards turned as one to the door and started to force it open.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yasmine tried not to breathe as she watched the guards to drop
unconcious around her. She was starting to wonder why she wasn't affected when the clouds started to moe. Condensing into the dark clad form of the man she'd seen in the Chatsubo.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hello, Yasmine. I just thought I'd drop by to see if you'd made it home safe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">==</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jake and Bianca cut across an empty cubicle farm,</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something's wrong. At this range I shouldn't be having such a hard time to establish comunication with an AI."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This isn't home Jake. It may be very different from the AI we grew up with."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"True, if I could stop long enough to enter a trance state I should be able to communicate no matter what."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here? Why not wait till we are actually in front of it. It's got to have some form of interface."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It might be a honeypot Bianca, or maybe just a rogue."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Well isn't that a cheerfull thought. We can use that office there.
I'll watch your back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jake sat crosslegged on the floor behind the desk. He closed his eyes and saw the physical positions of all the small machines about him. He reached farther for certain types even as he filtered out all the others. Soon he could see the arcology as a large empty space shot through by the glittering webs of computers. He zoomed in on one in particular. It glowed with power, he could sense the mind behind it peering through the fiber optic conduits that linked it to the sensors
in the building. He let his vision refocus on the conceptual. The shape of the hardware blurred and revealed the luminous shape of the software. He left behind the sullen clouds of fire that made up the tight curls of ICE's logic, the little blocks of code that made up the small machines sitting on desks, the multidimensional latices of the large expert systems. He move his mind closer to the complex mandala of a sentient AI. He concentrated on matching it's frequency, effectively 'pitching
his voice' to be heard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">==</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Snowdancer looked up as Maya suddenly paused. "What is it Maya?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm running some self diagnostics. I am receiving inputs from
nonexisting sensors."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm hearing a voice, it wants to talk. Please excuse me a moment
Dancer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maya?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maya!?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
