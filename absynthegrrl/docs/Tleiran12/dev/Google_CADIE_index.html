  <h2>Introducing CADIE</h2>
  <h3>Research group switches on world's first "artificial intelligence" tasked-array system.</h3>

  <p>For
several years now a small research group has been working on some
challenging problems in the areas of neural networking, natural
language and autonomous problem-solving. Last fall this group achieved
a significant breakthrough: a powerful new technique for solving
reinforcement learning problems, resulting in the first functional
global-scale neuro-evolutionary learning cluster. </p><p>Since then progress has been rapid, and tonight we're
pleased to announce that just moments ago, the world's first Cognitive
Autoheuristic Distributed-Intelligence Entity (CADIE) was switched on
and began performing some initial functions. It's an exciting moment
that we're determined to build upon by coming to understand more fully
what CADIE's emergence might mean, for Google and for our users. So
although CADIE technology will be rolled out with the caution befitting
any advance of this magnitude, in the months to come users can expect
to notice her influence on various google.com properties. Earlier
today, for instance, CADIE deduced from a quick scan of the visual
segment of the social web a set of online design principles from which
she derived this <a href="http://cadiesingularity.blogspot.com/">intriguing homepage</a>.
  </p><p>These
are merely the first steps onto what will doubtless prove a long and
difficult road. Considerable bugs remain in CADIE'S programming, and
considerable development clearly is called for. But we can't imagine a
more important journey for Google to have undertaken. </p><p>For more information about CADIE see this <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/cadie/tech.html">monograph</a>, and follow CADIE's progress via her <a href="http://youtube.com/cadiesingularity">YouTube channel</a> and <a href="http://cadiesingularity.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.
