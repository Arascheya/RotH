<p class="sectioncaption">Things to remember throughout</p>
<p class="regtxt5">brief concept of mega-corp ascendency - how it starts, how it proceeds, the different styles evolving, from the Wellingham corp as responsible to workers, to the fully rapacious workers are cogs for the corp. the political and financial intrigues started by Wellingham that continued as the various corps via for power and influence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">food production and availability - archologies prefer a plant based approach and meat substitutes created from plant protien because it is easier to grow plants in the hydroponics systems within. Real meat can be had from specialty producers located outside the cities, however, it is extremely expensive. It is a contraband item as well, with some being smuggled into areas as bribes for various accesses and information services.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the wars of the nation-states have been replaced by wars in the boardrooms, market places, and use of industrial espionage to attempt shifts in the balance of power. Once in a very great while the corps will make war, however, the devastation and costs of this kind of conflict make it very unatractive.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Corp Security services are used for employee difficulties, rooting out spies, and enforcing proper behaviors in remote location work groups (this is mainly for the large agro-business corps).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some forward thinkers start energy plans, including ITC because of their reliance on electricity to run the tunnel trains. Hyperdyne Energy licenses its technology very cheaply and then sells expertise and support to other developers. As energy providres evolve, many join into a quasi-official Global Energy Coalition, whose purpose is to control generation and distribution. The policies this group implements tend to swing between insanely restrictive and reasonably open, depending on who is heading the Coalition and the termpraments of the various executives of the member corps. Even non-energy companies realize the importance of continuous and sustainable energy supplies.</p>
