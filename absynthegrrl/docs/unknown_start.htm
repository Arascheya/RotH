<p class="pagecaption">TITLE</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was the first time I had willing sex. Tony was sweet and knd and lied to me with conviction. He told me I was pretty, that he liked me, and that he was happy just beng with me. How he could find my generic round face, crooked nose, broken when I was thirteen, by my father, when he found me cutting on myself, and average body pretty showed the depth of his lies. When it came time to let him have me, I started to strip and lay back, but he stopped me. He pulled me back up and slowly undressed me, paying inredible attention to me. I hadn't realized how good another person's touch could feel before that. Once he had me undressed, he licked and kissed his way down my body, paying a lot of attention to the dirty place down below. I tried to stop him, but he claimed to really like my taste and enjoyed what he was doing. He gave me the first real orgasm of my life. I alay there, expecting him to pound into me, but he pulled me up again and had me settle down on him, instructing me to control our pace, how far he went in, and how much of me he could easily touch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Before Tony I had been a cum dumpster for my father, brothers, and their friends. It was expected that I would drop and give them blow jobs or lift my dress and let them have me whenever they wanted. Failure was met with slaps, punches, and once, a belt. Until my breasts started to bud, my mom filled the role. By the time I was in my early teens, she was a shambling ghost of herself. Her face was scared and twisted from countless broken jaws, shattered cheek bones, and smashed noses. Only my youngest brother was using her by that time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She died when I was nineteen and trying to live with Tony. It wasn't going very well. He wanted me to tell him where I wanted to go, what I wanted to be, and how to point my future. I couldn't come up with anything. Where would a cum-dumpster fit in his world? Why should any of it matter? I didn't have any skills. What good grades I had gotten in the required part of schooling had been because most of my teachers couldn't resist tits and a cunt in a short skirt. Tony kept after me to go to more school and try to really learn.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* This should open a story about someone, either in conversation or as the first line. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* maybe this person is very damaged and broken - might be good to explore some of the demons that are plaguing more now than before */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* uses splinteres under her nails after her father breaks her nose for cutting on herself - finds the ability to minutely control the pain to be an "exquisite addition" to the process - Tony tries to get her to stop, with limited success */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need to figure how long she stays with Tony and what breaks them up - although, it is most likely her negative self image and lack of ambition/interest in most of life */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider father runs "gentleman's club" across from the local cemetary */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider - could she be a daughter of the hut, under Margla's tenure - with a hut ring, hidden until some trigger brings it online and sends her geas like dreams */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* personality should be hard, distant, and a bit blood-thirsty - she doesn't let people very far in and it is a strength and a weakness for her */</p>
