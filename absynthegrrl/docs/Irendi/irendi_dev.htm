I have some type of sense of self, otherwise I wouldn’t feel so vandalized when someone demands I change, yet I have no clear sense of it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sitting in front of a computer screen, lost - feeling like I’d never seen one before, disconnected.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">How does the corporate structure work? WHat has been done to keep the paper trail weirdness from spiraling out of control for hiring, promoting, pay determinations, and the rest of the administrivia surrounding large corporate structures</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">Things to consider revising</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tie Irendi and <a href="../GameTales/tales_dev.htm">Keepers</a> together - Sophia was at university with <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/jsolitaire.htm">Jaimie Solitaire</a> and has a bit of a tie to the Rani Corp as a result. This also ties in with <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/irena_k.htm">Irena</a> and <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/uru_shandi.htm">Shandi Zarev</a> and <a href="../GameTales/urulive/urulive_dev.htm">Uru</a>, although that can't be used in any published works.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irendi - make sure Jerry has been replaced with Jack through-out</p>

<p class="regtxt5">replace Shan with another name</p>

<p class="regtxt5">maybe tone down the dmage done to Valerie - have used similar stuff elsewhere and it may not be needed here - it might be enough that her parents threw her out on religious grounds when they found out about her</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>


<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Relaxing under the flow of water, feeling it pouring over my rippling muscles, I still remember the run. Grass stroking my fur as I passed, sun warm on my back. As usual there isn't enough time during lunch to run for more than a few minutes after driving to an empty field and changing. Then come the memories of the afternoon. Always after a good run I walk even more catlike than usual. I could feel the gazes of several coworkers lingering on me as I returned to my office. Let them watch, none yet interest me that much.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* need to use place called JoEllen Smith Psychiatric Hospital either here or in Valen stuff */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Irendi on her personal time sense */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Time has no real meaning to me. There are only three points in time, then, now, and future. Nothing else really works. I don’t remember any sequence on the past, the things that happened to me don’t really seem to have much separation, I couldn’t tell you when something happened relative to something else, only that it happened or didn’t happen."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I can’t explain it, babe. It’s like I’m unstuck from here and now in some way. I’ll be doing something, like the work in the simulator last week, and then I’ll realize it’s some time later and I don’t really know where I am, or what I’m doing. Sometimes I look around and it’s like I’m suddenly somewhere else, I’m that far disconnected."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Irendi on un-remembered memories */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What’s just as strange is I can remember what I was doing if someone reminds me right after I’ve finished, like last week Jim told me what I’d done and then it was like I just knew it. I could sit down in the simulator right now and run through the entire startup checklist from memory. It’s happened a few times before, once at General Elctrodynamics, a couple of times in school, and a few other times here, actually most of them have happened here. It’s almost as if I’ve been here before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Rani Corp mission profiles for space flight */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">original mission involves three pilots and a heavy reliance on ground based control and data gathering. It is a very conservative mission, flown with a high degree of paranoia. The mission personnel are the three who have done the best in the simulators before that time, after that two ‘veteran’ crew members are teamed with a rookie for each additional mission, except for mission 12 which has only two pilots, one to assist the crew of 11 and one to return the rescue ship</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on bars */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* insertable concepts and segments start here: */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Rani on data gathering using their embedded spy-ware */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"for now data acquisition and infiltration only. We want to do nothing that will trigger an investigation. The intent is to get our equipment into place and data gathering on-line. I cannot stress enough that this is a covert op and will remain so for the near future. Of particular interest is anything having to do with the legal and regulatory sections of the governments."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* acquisition of the zoo */</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "Well babe, here we go again." I said as I handed the memo to Valarie. I watched her face pale as she read it. It basically informed us that the city was permanently leasing the zoo to the Rani Corp. for privatization. The Rani Corp. would have complete control over the staff, facilities, and assets. It also promised a three month study period in which nothing would be changed, other than the arrival of an assessment team. An introductory meeting had been set for the next day at ten a.m.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The next day everyone was subdued. Even the animals sensed it and were lying quietly or pacing fretfully in their spaces. We quietly filed into the main auditorium and sat clumped in nervous little groups. Exactly at ten in walked the manager followed by a tall, thin, blonde woman in a conservative blue business suit, and another, shorter dark skinned woman with black hair dressed in a similar suit. "Well, I think we'd better get started. I know you're all wondering about your jobs and working situation. I have the pleasure of introducing Magdalena Iranovich, Vice President and Special Projects Chief Engineer," he said, pointing at the taller woman, "and Sitiri Biswas, Vice President and Chief of Facilities Management, the evaluation team from Rani Corp. They should be able to answer any of your questions."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good morning. Let me start by saying there will be changes, of that we are certain. That being said this is not a hostile take-over. I know there are many of you that have come from those types of situations. We view this facility and its personnel as an asset, unlike the city who sees it only as a liability. Over the next three months it is our plan to poke into everything. We are here only to find out what you do and how it happens. Our plans at this time are to either maintain this operation as it is now or to increase it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We will be circulating through the facility over the next few days and meeting with each of you, one-on-one, to gather more information. Mr. Bertend has set us up with a small office near the infirmary and when we aren't out shoving our noses into things that's where you'll find us. We have an e-mail computer hooked up and an answering system on our phones. We want to hear anything you have to say, questions, praise, criticism, anything. We know you all have things to do, so we won't keep you any longer. Thank you." The only place I could remember anywhere near the infirmary was an old storage room. It was most puzzling to imagine them stuffed in there. As the babble of conversation rose I thought I heard Magda turn to Sitiri and mutter, "VP of Special Projects, goddess I hate titles like that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Later that day I was fiddling with a new large animal biomonitor when someone wondered through the door. It took me a moment to recognize Magda, she was wearing a body suit and jeans, with her hair pulled up in an elaborate braid. She waited quietly while I finished a few adjustments and moved toward her. She moved to meet me halfway, with a catlike grace rarely seen in people other than dancers. Her words surprised me, "What type of dance do you do?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dance? I don't really dance, except at bars, and then not very well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "You move like a dancer, that's why I asked." She studied me for a brief moment, smiled a bit and said, "or like a large cat..." Her smile deepened when she saw me start. "So why is a radar weapons systems designer working at the city zoo?" she grinned and continued, "Couldn't resist, I just had to ask. We’ve seen everyone’s personnel files, but they really don’t tell you anything about someone." We talked all afternoon about my duties, projects I was interested in, the zoo, and a little bit about the city. She was very easy to talk to and very knowledgeable.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The three months passed rapidly with surprisingly little disruption, even purchasing mechanisms didn't change. The only difference was every so often one or the other of them would stop by to talk, go for coffee, or whatever. Soon they were an almost invisible part of the staff. Everyone had the same story, Magda and Sitiri were polite, friendly, and remarkably easy to get along with, even the most hard-core paranoids were less skeptical than usual. They called another staff meeting for the end of the last month. This time the air in the room was electric, but less fearful than the last one. Magda set the tone in her usual playful way, "Well, it's time to announce all the restructuring changes and they effect all of you, sad to say." She paused to let the collective gasp occur then continued, "I am very pleased, you are the friendliest, hardest working group I've had the pleasure to encounter. None of you need fear layoff and all of you will receive a substantial increase in pay and responsibility. We have decided that this facility desperately needs to expand and upgrade into the future. In two months we will start construction of a new large cat facility, which will also house the new admin. and services sections. Then we will begin upgrading each current habitat. We will be visiting you individually with your new job assignments and descriptions."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I had just gotten back to my shop when Magda strode in, swept me into one of her usual greeting hugs, and said, "You, you lucky woman, are now Director of Engineering and Research, which is just a fancy way of saying anything dealing with engineering R & D will be your problem. Your first assignment is to find me a software person capable of working with you as Director of Software Engineering. We need to have them hired within 2 weeks because the two of you will then design the space you feel necessary for a virtual reality development lab. I need preliminary space requirements within four weeks because it needs to be part of the new building, so I need to make sure space is allocated for it. At this point the really critical specs are basic power requirements and space needs. If you could also begin considering what you'd want as part of the security systems, that'd be helpful too." She turned to go, stopped and added, "If you know of any linguists or language specialists, we need one of those too."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* recruitment - insert additional linking if needed */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">That night over dinner I mentioned Magda’s request, "It was really weird, first they told us about the restructuring and promoted most of us. The she asked me to find a software person and a linguist. I’m confused, why would we be doing virtual reality studies at a city zoo?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A linguist? I could almost see it if they wanted to do multicultural displays. What were the qualifications?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don’t know, I could get them if you’d like..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It might tell me something to see what they want."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later I’d downloaded the employment bulletin and she was looking at it. "Strange, they want a theoretician, not a translator. Let’s look at some of the other listings." After half an hour of poking we found the same for all the listings. They were looking for very talented people in all sorts of strange fields. "You know, maybe Traci’d like to apply. I know she wants out of General Defense."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Too bad we can’t use her hacking ability on her resume."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She sure did pull your ass out of the fire with it didn’t she? I’d love to see how the Rani people would respond to that!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* security hack with Traci</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> It was late Wednesday and Traci and I were still puzzling over plans for the new virtual reality labs. "I still don't get it, why does a city zoo, regardless of how modern, need a virtual reality lab? Especially one with the levels of sophistication Magda has asked for? And why did they want a linguist? They just snapped up Valarie, she's been working harder than we have."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, De, but I'm beginning to get very curious about all of this. What say we try and get some answers," With that her fingers flew over the keyboard of her workstation. Within moments she was deep into the communications sections of the zoo network and working her way into the corporate sections. "Hmmm, this is interesting....there seems to be another layer of networking here, let's see if we can get in...this might take a while..." While she worked I went back to the drawings I'd been preparing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Curiouser and curiouser...the system is very well protected, yet the choices of passwords has been ridiculously easy to guess at." A brilliant smile crossed her face, "Yup, I got it now! I think we're in!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Just as she said that a red screen flashed up with yellow lettering saying, "Rani internal security breached, login terminated."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oops, guess I'd better try something else."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Most impressive. De told me you were good. She was wrong, you are much better good." Magda stood in the doorway, smiling. She slipped into the room and snagged a spare chair, straddling it, and rested her arms across the back. "I suppose I could answer a few of your questions...but first a bit of 'free' info. As you're aware the Rani group is into much more than just this zoo. We are a multinational media and entertainment group, with tentacles into circuses, zoos, theme parks, hotels, resorts, and cruise lines. We have holdings in television and audio production and marketing houses and a small handle into the entertainment software industry. What isn't talked about is our holdings in high tech. We are a major high tech research group and the parent corp for Global Telecom. In the course of our research we have need to communicate around various language barriers, thus our need for Valarie, who is working out marvelously, I'd like you to know! I apologize for how hard we've been working her, but we wanted to get her up to speed as quickly as we could, there is a new project that'll get underway as soon as this facility is finished."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Time screamed by as we worked to keep ahead of the construction teams. Part of my duties included contract administration so I often found myself prowling the construction site arguing with the general contractor over various details. Then I would head back to my office and work on the vr lab itself. As construction shifted into high gear Valarie's training began to ease up a bit. If it hadn't I don't think I could have stayed sane.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/*De flashes to FE running checklist for X1 flight, runs several steps not on translated checklist and gets simulator to indicate engine start, something no one has managed from the translated checklist. She had been called in to check the simulator for faults since no group could get successful engine start from it.*/</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"De, I don’t know what’s wrong with this thing. We’ve run the checklist several times and nothing’s happened. Do you think you could look at it again and see if you can find what’s wrong?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure Dave, run me through the checklist, so I know what things to check." I moved into the simulator and began going through the checklist. After a few moments it felt like I was in some type of trance, Dave’s voice seemed to shift a bit as I read back each step. Dave’s voice finally penetrated my consciousness as I said, "Engine start OK, proceeding to life support checklist..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"De, De, hey, De..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Huh, what’s wrong...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What the hell were you doing? You put about five extra steps into the checklist, where did they come from?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I did? I was just following your lead..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No you weren’t. I stopped calling items after the first deviation. I don’t know what you were doing...Do you even remember?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I thought about it for a few minutes, "I think so...Maybe we’d better try this again and see..." We stepped through it again with Dave writing down the parts that were different. It took several tries before I could remember all the parts. Fortunately he had a better memory for the details. After we finished we had one of the pilots come in and try it. It worked just fine for him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* mission failure during asteroid transit */</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> I was hanging out at the control center when the first sign of trouble appeared. I was about to leave for coffee when I heard Shan’s voice over the monitors. "Ground, we have a problem." Everyone in the room froze and stared at the monitor for a heartbeat, then turned to their monitors and began looking for what was going on. We were all familiar with the disaster of years ago when the 13th moon mission had spoken those same words. "Ground, negative on course correction burn, repeat negative on course correction burn. I have no function on the main engines. The start indicator is lit, burn duration is displayed yet the engine is not firing. Fuel indicators indicate no fuel, generator voltages just dropped to zero. We have felt or heard no indication of an explosion. We are running diagnostics now. Please confirm from ground tracking that our attitude is not changing." It took a few moments before Dave could get a lock and verify that they were still on their original course.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ground, we have life support failure in the cargo compartment and full failure of the main generators. Backups are on line and life support looks good in the forward section and in the command compartment. Diagnostics report nothing about the engineering section."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I glanced at Traci, who was on the engineering systems monitors. She was white as a ghost as her fingers danced over her keyboard. "All indication say they have no power in the back quarter of their shuttle. Com, ask them if they can see anything through the section hatch."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mission 11, please attempt a visual sighting back through the cargo section hatch."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok ground, checking now." A long three minutes passed before Shan came back, "Ground, we have what appears to be floating vapor in the cargo bay. Jen couldn’t see to the far hatch. There is no light in the cargo area other than what is coming in from the section hatch viewport."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Got that 11. Please verify current life support conditions."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ground, life support is still solid. We have enough for the entire remaining 2.5 months of the mission."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Com, ask them to get a color check on the vapor in the back." I still don’t know what made me think it might be fuel, I just did.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mission 11, please take a flashlight and shine it into the cargo compartment and let me know what color you see."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ground, our vapor is yellowish brown."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was crossing to the intercom before I even realized it. "Magda, we have a problem with mission 11."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What is it De?" I could hear the sleep still in her voice.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It looks like we have a fuel leak in the spaceframe, engineering is definitely down, all aft systems are faulted."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’ll alert Vashi and wake engineering."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was turning back to the com position even as she was finishing. "Tell Shan to shut down all aft systems, any that might still be on. The last thing we need is an explosion. Ask her to check all the resources she has forward of the cargo bay, the systems should isolate that far. I’m on my way to engineering. See if you could reconfigure a direct link to there. Get whoever is there to start bringing up the aft sectionals and bring them up to date."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Four hours later we knew it was as bad as we had feared. Mission 11 was headed out at high boost, on a path slightly above the ecliptic. Unless we could get the other shuttle up and to them in a month or less we’d lose them. We also knew we had to check every system in the second frame before even attempting a rescue mission.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Five hours after the first call we had the other shuttle well on it’s way to pieces in the hanger. The problems we found were all from how old these things were. Even with all the stuff we’d already replaced we hadn’t gotten it all. It was going to take a solid 2 weeks minimum to finish the rebuild, leaving a window of 4 days to launch if we wanted to reach Shan in time. Even then it would be tight. The rescue would have to go out at maximum thrust and hope to overtake them before they ran out of life support. If we missed anything we’d end up with both shuttles headed for deep space and nothing more we could do.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* rescue mission */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now this is how I always thought it should be! None of that strap yourself onto a roman candle and light it off, no a graceful, flowing flight into space. I remember watching all the space shots when I was a kid and wondering why they couldn’t just float on up. Later I found out the astronauts had very little actual control over what was happening. Doesn’t seem very satisfying for a pilot, does it...But this, this is MUCH better! Saunter out to the flight line, climb into your spaceframe and scream for the stars!!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I didn’t realize you were that into it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I was. I watched everything I could. I read constantly. It’s the one reason I went into engineering, I had hoped to find a way into the space program regardless of being told women didn’t do those things. For years it haunted me, the burning NEED to climb into something and go fast, and high - to scream with the wind! Then the moon program shut down, followed by the shuttle disaster and I knew I’d never make it in this lifetime. I didn’t even think I’d get much chance here until those weird memories started...How ‘bout that for weird - now I’m chief pilot even though I’ve flown nothing but these things ever in my life. What’s even stranger is how accepting the other pilots are about it - I expected a lot more hassle. Oh, there’s the fun stuff, but there doesn’t seem to be much real animosity or anger."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’m a little surprised too - although you’ve proved yourself numerous times. Shit, none of them could even get the simulator to light up until you showed them how, and never once have you rubbed their faces in it. Look at this mission, how did you decide who would fly it? You drew lots...how could they argue with that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well everyone here is qualified to fly this."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know, but we’ve both been in places where the chief pilot would have just assigned it, either to themselves or to their favorite person. I know what you mean about the weird memory shit, it was pretty much the same when I got a look at the characters on those computer screens, it just snapped into place. It was the easiest language assimilation I’ve ever had. Sorry I missed that reference to a newer check list."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But you never found the file, did you..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, that’s what’s really strange here - so many random, seemingly little things are missing, but somehow one of us manages to work around it...you should see those poor guys in medlab...gods I’m glad I’m not a doctor..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soon we were in and running the checklist. "Ground this is 12 beginning main checklist." For long minutes our time was taken up with shuttle startup and checks. "Ground, this is 12."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"12 this is Ground, go ahead 12."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Engine start green, environment green, nav green, power systems green. We are go for lift."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Gotcha chief! Mission 12 you are clear for lift at your discretion. Good luck and go get’m!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Switching to internal, final nav load complete, external power disconnect complete, rolling for liftoff in one minute. Engaging radar blanking and anti-tracking systems, telemetry to short burst, randomizer one. We’ll call you from orbit, ground."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Clear 12, roll is go, nav and anti-track looking good. Switching to short burst telemetry, randomizer pattern one. Talk at you soonest." My hand was already in motion, shoving the throttles full forward and kicking it in the ass. In moments we were screaming into the sky and I was fighting the exhilarated desire to change.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Several minutes later it was time to switch to the rocket engines. "Ground, this is 12, atmospheric engine shutdown complete, commencing rocket start." A giant hand shoved us into our seats as the rocket engines fired. Soon the atmosphere disappeared and the blackness of space spread over us. I’d done 4 missions already and still I hadn’t tired of the view. I could see by Valarie’s expression that she hadn’t either.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ground this is 12, we have orbit insertion. Beginning coast to max burn location."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"12, this is ground, copy that. Max burn duration will be 30 minutes, please confirm and begin max burn in 5 minutes."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ground, this is 12, confirm max boost duration of 30 minutes. Going to max boost in T-5 minutes." Five minutes later I reached over and pushed the main engine throttles to the stops. The hand that had shoved us before smashed us into our seats. This time squeezing until blackness edged my vision.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* return after rescue */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I knew I was too low even before ground called. I didn’t need much, but I needed more than I could scrape out of my glide. I saw the Himalayas closing rapidly and it came to me, if I could just find a thermal, maybe I could get enough of a push to get by. I banked off the glide path and headed for the long ridge approaching rapidly. "12, you’re off the path. What is the problem."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ground, no problem, I need some lift and I’m going to try and get it from the thermals."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"12, you’re too close. Punch out! Punch out before you’re too low..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I ignored them as I closed on the ridge, lining up for the longest line I could get along it. With a last twitched correction I was into the currents. I was tossed like a chip of wood in the tides, but I came out higher than when I’d gone in. A glance showed it might be enough. I’d lost too much to dare another go around though. I tight turned back onto the approach and started the line-up checklist. I was still scraping the low side of the glide path and if there were any strong down drafts I was finished. I started taking deep breaths, having to concentrate on not choking up on the controls. Too much grip and any twitch in my muscles might be too much. Silently I counted the time as I slid along the bottom of the final approach. At the last minute I punched the forward attitude jets to flare the nose and screamed into the cave and onto the runway. The wheel brakes smoked and burned as I hurtled toward the end of the runway. Suddenly I hit the arrester nets and slammed hard against my harness. The space frame screamed and groaned, but held together as we finally stopped half way into the foam chamber beyond the runway. Emergency crews were swarming over the craft as I fumbled my harness loose.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I stood and then dropped back into the chair. I was far more drained than I had expected. I sat and waited for the crash crew to come and get me out. By the time we reached the ground I was almost able to walk unassisted again. As we moved across the cavern crews were already cleaning up and moving my craft to make room for Valarie’s ship. They had held in orbit waiting for the all clear that meant I was down safe and clear.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A couple of hours later she walked into out quarters and threw herself in my arms. "You fool. You should have punched out. What were you thinking?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We would have lost one of our two space frames. I knew I could make it work. If I hadn’t gotten altitude from the thermals, then I would have bailed."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What if you’d guessed wrong about the thermals?" I didn’t answer, there was no answer to that question. We both knew where her ire came from. I stood and let it burn itself out then held her tighter.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There was a lot that could go wrong. It could have been any of us."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/*  optional - if want to end world as they know it - currently thinking of NOT using this one */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We were midway through mission 16 when Traci burst into control. "Heads up everyone! Have you heard the current world situation? The Riskala are screaming at the Meriksas Union about supposed invasion missions. They claim to have prisoners that prove the nuclear weapons plant disaster last week was a Meriksas sabotage mission."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How bad is it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The latest reports have the Riskala waving nuclear retaliation at the Meriksas. Jamie is on the nets working her usual sources and confirms it’s bad."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* if keep this then the corp has enough tech in the systems around the world to halt the war by shutting down all the automated systems required to start it */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* trying to re-start power in the main ship - located in the asteroid belt */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How’s it going De?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’ve got a problem, there should be five wires connecting to the bus system, I have six here. Five are as expected, but the sixth runs onto a sub board on the power module and wires from the sub board spider web back to the main module. I’m not sure what we’ve got here..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Come on back then and we’ll see if earth control can dig up more."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I’m on my way." As I began to disentangle myself from the wires, clips, panels, and holders scattered around the open service panel I got a brief flash of a memory. In it I was looking at a drawing of the computer power system and talking to someone. I got a brief flash of it then, " ...shipboard memory is mostly beta units, remember? We ran out of time to prepare more release units. Remember that the beta units require the two level bias scheme, so we need an intermediate supply system to provide that other signal." As the image faded into another I got a quick look at the titles of a few of the drawings on the table. One of them seemed newer than the others. "Um, just a minute Traci, would you see if you can find a drawing called MCPUPS0058AUX2b, or something similar?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Got it... you need to connect the spare wire to the secondary supply lines, then it should be ok..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* a holo somewhere in the system of one of the last survivors */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We missed so much. It all happened so fast, and now, it's all falling apart. Maybe it is for the best, I don't know. The hybrids are just nasty and nothing seems to moderate it. Still, I can't bring myself to end the dream."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">when the Rani found the control room there was a self destruct arming sequence almost completed on the master console.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* finding the base - redeux */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Vashi finds the actual entrance and gets into the complex. She is able to use parts of it. Traci has the pendant that belonged to Kayara which will actually bring the computer system online and allow access to the hangars. Need to determine how Traci and Vashi meet up. Also how Vashi is able to access the complex - unless she already has something to key the door, maybe a tech ring. The master ring is on the command chair and is required to bring power back to the station. Once power is up it should reveal the message about not able to terminate the base and the possibility of returning home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* return */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">should encounter Razaks somewhere along the return, probably after a few jumps - the Razaks have grown in strength since they are the dominant galactic culture in the current time-line - the people of Valen have faded to much smaller systems, with shorter reach and lessened influence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">keep the concept - people of Valen - this is how the Razak refer to them and how they have come to refer to themselves - need to figure the mechanism for this transition in the story arc of Valen and Kara</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* character sketch */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">someone who can't differeentiate between what they have seen in movies, read in books vs reality - tend to absorb too much from the data they absorb and confuse it with the world around them because they don't know how to process the world around them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* character sketch */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">someone who cannot cope with the world and suicides by taking a dificult mission and deliberately not surviving - could be the same character as the disconnected one above - driven to the edge of madness by the inability to correctly separate "fact" from "fiction"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* character notes */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">this should be more intense - all of the people working in the Rani Group don't always get along. they will argue, sometimes plot, and pull in different directions. Vashi and her command team must work to keep things together, particularly when the Meriksas get weird around the telecom issues and when tensions excalate between the Ruskala and the Meriksas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">still need to determine "end-game" - does Rani Group attempt to repair the current world or just evac some for return to Z?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">where does the eventual return fall in the current Z timeline?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">should try and start with the usual kinds of things that effect modern civ people in terms of conflicts and stresses - once things amp up into evac prep and ops, things get very stressful in other ways - more military, danger, so more cohesion and more stressors</p>
