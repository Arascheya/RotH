<p class="pagecaption">Chapter 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I landed in Angelicanos, Lefronica, Meriksas Allegiance, land of freedom and opportunity and spent six hours in customs and immigration. My bags were emptied and everything pulled apart, poured out, sqeezed out, and I was subjected to a body cavity search. In the end they handed me a check for what they thought my stuff was worth and released me with a vague appology about looking like someone they wanted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The van to the university wasn't out front by the time I checked and a call to the school said there wouldn't be another one until the following day. I was given the address of the residence hall I was assigned to and told to report to the house administrator. They would settle me and an make sure I was processed in the morning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outside the airport, I stood trying to flag a taxi, using the same technique as everyone else. The cabs just ignored me in favor of the white people standing past me. At last a more battered looking one pulled up beside me. The driver, a dark colored woman a little older than me, waved me in. "You look lost."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm here for the university, but I was kept in customs too long for the bus."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome to the Meriksas. If you aren't pale, forget it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't bellieve the lies. I did, now I'm driving this thing and living with four others in a single bedroom place. Which university?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lefronica Technical Institute."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Better get comfortable. It'll be about an hour."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But it's only 34 klicks, um, what's that, about 20 miles?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome to Angelicanos, city of smog, traffic, and crazy people."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What lies did you mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My parents immigrated here from Presaara just before I was born. They came believing they could find a better life in the land of freedom and opportunity. They found plenty of opportunities, to be revild, feared, sneered at, and pushed aside. Their dream of a new world got them what they had before, a small deli store-front with a movie rental place in the back, in the Presaaran ghetto. They pushed their children, my sister, brother, and I, to excel in academic pursuits. We did, including some scholarships, student loans, and degrees. My brother is back at the store, my sister married a rich Presaaran man, and I'm driving taxi because I make more doing this than I did at the series of shit jobs I found with my business admin degree. Some of my classmates, the lighter colored ones, went on to good jobs with big companies. The rest of us had to take what we could find. Don't back down, don't give in, and you might not be buried by this culture. What do you plan to study at Lefronica?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Engineering, probably electrical."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good luck with that. Engineers are more a white boys club than business leaders."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll be returning home after I finish school."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where's home, if I might ask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nehtan. The Nehtanese have been kind to my people, I want to return something for that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your people? Aren't you Nehtanese?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I'm a Tzani wanderer by birth. In Nehtan there is a program to semi-settle the wanderers. My parents were two that tried it. As part of the program we had access to housing, schools, and medical care in exchange for seven months in one place. The other five months we were on the road, through Nehtan and the surrounding countries. Many times in school I would be surprised by the things my classmates hadn't seen in their lives. Things like death, fights, persecution for just being alive, and the freedom that comes from not having too much to carry around."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What was it like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Probably the happiest times of my life. My mom worked as a picker or repaired clothes. My father sharpened knives, fixed small metal things and the odd small appliance. By the time I was twelve I was fixing engines, transmissions, and electronics. If I could get it apart, I could get it back together again. After that, it was just a matter of figuring out what was broken."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* concepts */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* cab driver is brilliant at business and becomes director of finance for Rani Corp. Name is Fairuzah Esfahani. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">in cab conversation - need driver to explain her statement about "the lie"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">have Vashi explain about the 7 months settled, 5 months with the wanderers the Nehtanese government sponsors and that she has hardened up from it</p>

<p class="regtxt5">need to make the Meriksas a bit on the claustophobic side for Vashi - the land of freedom doesn't seem much like it to her - this needs to play into what Irendi experiences as well as Shan and Irena</p>

<p class="regtxt5">need to find a reason Vashi would end up spending a night at Outcast House</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* witnesses and stops an out of hand encounter between a classmate and a group of boys - "let her go, as she pushes the knife against her hostage</p>

<p class="regtxt5">she's bluffing</p>

<p class="regtxt5">i'm not of your culture. i know how to dispose of bodies and i have killed before, said quietly and calmly to the group in general as she draws blood from the captive's neck - she had a hard time after the killing. it was done to protect her younger sister from a flesh merchant wanting to take the sister and sell her into a brothel, but she doesn';t let this on to the watching boys</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* in the boardroom - much later */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">don't mistake me for a pampered businessperson just because i wear the clothes. your proposal is lies, your documents are lies, and you are lying right now. when you are ready to negotiate in honesty, we may talk again. Jen, please show them out.</p>
