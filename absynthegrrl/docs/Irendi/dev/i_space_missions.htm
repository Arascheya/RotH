<p class="pagecaption">Irendi - Space Missions</p>
<p class="regtxt5">ship stuff</p>
<p class="regtxt9">ideal fault condition has m/a system shut down first as fuel is depleted, the APU faults when it’s fuel runs out</p>
<p class="regtxt5">concerns - actual fault status of ship - does it still exist, is it in tact, how has it survived the time lag, will it restart after such a long cold soak</p>
<p class="regtxt5">beginning shuttle mission use NASA like methodology around base control and shuttle crews, as missions move farther out control takes on more and more of an advisory/secondary role</p>
<p class="regtxt5">shuttle systems - phase 1</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 1 - startup and in atmosphere tests, main nav systems, control systems and life support, jamming/antidetection systems testing</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 2 - low orbit tests, vacuum tests, continued life support testing.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 3 - nav checks, L point insertion and return</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 4 - extended flight tests, lunar transit and landing if systems all go, done with low energy flight systems only - duration 2 days flight, 1 day lunar orbit, descent, 1 day stay, 2 day lift off and return to earth orbit, 1 day earth orbit and return</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 5 - high energy burn tests, 5 hour transit out, 5 hour return, braking/reentry</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 6 - medium range high energy transit tests - mars transit 1 month out, 1 month back</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 7 - docking tests and training  at L point, requires both shuttles</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 8 - asteroid transit and prelim search - if locate then do prelim outer scans, and evaluations - on data eval proceed to phase 2 missions, asteroid transit takes 1.5 months one way</p>
<p class="regtxt9">/*  actually this mission is plagued with problems from the start and requires an emergency mission to correct for them - mission is rescue of crew and recovery of shuttle */</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 9 - rescue/recovery mission</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 10 - asteroid transit and prelim search - if locate then do prelim outer scans, and evaluations - on data eval proceed to phase 2 missions, asteroid transit takes 1.5 months one way</p>
<p class="regtxt5">phase 2 missions</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 11 - entry, prelim checks, computer startup and download, telem system checks, life support resources checks</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 12 - space frame checkout - stresses, damage, integrity</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 13 - environment/life support checkout, power distribution checks, nav sys checks, engineering systems checks</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 14 - restart or replace and start APU, slow section by section restoration of life support with full systems evaluation at each step</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 15 - place live in crew, begin extensive checkout of all systems, eval life support stability, if not stable crew will not remain</p>
<p class="regtxt9">mission 16 and up - resupply, crew rotation, any repairs required, upgrades, etc.</p>
