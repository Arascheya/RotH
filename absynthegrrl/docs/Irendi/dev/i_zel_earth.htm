<p class="regtxt5">/* general thoughts on origins of the project from the Zeltropian side */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">just before Karanal is evac’d one of the exploration groups through the Gate lands on earth, they are really early and end up altering the life forms enough by actions and presence that those arriving later can interbreed with the indigenous forms.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">During the evac of Karanal the second time the ships are jumped in time until 1000 years before present before arrival. This places them in the time frame where they could  end up part of gypsy bands leaving India and traveling west. Some of them splinter off and land in morocco and similar places.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The survivors live about 200 to 300 earth years - this allows some impact on the cultures around them. Another part of paving the way for Vashi and the rest.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Also keep in mind the alterations to the earth time-line for Krys and Valen. This could figure in as well. As well as the whole Hut and London scenario - this will shift how the time-line evolves and could be used to set the stage for this time as well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* earth approach and emergency landing */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">alarms were going off everywhere yet the voices were quiet and controlled, "approach is bad, we’re dropping too fast"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I can’t get the drives online"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"LIII this LII, are you there? We are executing an emergency landing...third planet from the sun, please respond"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">then  a voice sounded close, maybe even from where I was watching, "Eris, make sure she gets on the shuttle, she’ll demand to stay, but she must be on the shuttle. Dors, let me know when they’re away."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Moments later - "“in atmosphere, shuttle launches no longer possible."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Three are away - yes she was on the last of them"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">a few nights later another dream - walking along a metal corridor and stopping at a hatch. On it was "Warning - no gravity beyond this point." Opening the hatch I slid through and into the shuttle beyond. Quickly I placed the package I was carrying under the pilot’s seat and the retreated back to the corridor.</p>
