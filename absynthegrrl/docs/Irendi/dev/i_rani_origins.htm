<p class="regtxt5">I was waiting for Valarie, who had been called for a special meeting, and was watching Traci bringing up the vr system for final tests when Magda appeared in the doorway with Valarie. "I'm glad you're all here. It's time I let you know what is really happening here, but first I want your word that none of you will say a word about this outside this room."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We looked at each other, then nodded.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good. Traci, if you'd be so good as to access and run this file? We can talk while it loads, it'll take a while." Magda listed off a very cryptic file path and name. "This project, along with many of our others, are a front for what's really happening. About ten years ago a small group of seismologists got lost in the Tibetan Himalayas. There should have been no way it could have happened, but it did. They went through a rather long ordeal over many days and finally stumbled across a deep cave. It was fortunate they did for the storm that blew in that night would have surely killed them had they been out in the open. It had a very narrow, winding entry that opened into a large chamber with a clear pool in the center of a dry sandy floor. The pool radiated warmth and turned out to be about 85 degrees in temperature. Exhausted by their ordeal, they soon fell asleep.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">That night one of the party, Vashi Ristan, woke to some rather odd sounds. She described them as low mechanical rumblings. Puzzled, she lay awake for a long time, but the sounds never did repeat. Finally curiosity got too much for her and she decided to wander farther back into the cave. What she found was a series of passages winding back into the mountain and ending in a not quite natural looking chamber. Faintly inscribed in the ceiling was a seven pointed star which began to glow as she studied it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Moments later a low grinding noise started to her left as a section of wall slid sideways into its neighbor. Soft yellow light and warmth emanated from the seven sided passageway leading even deeper into the mountain. Curiosity warred with her caution until she stepped into the corridor and began walking. New sections of light activated in front of her as the ones behind dimmed down. After five minutes of walking her caution took control and she hurried back to the outer rooms. As she passed out of the star chamber the doorway to the passage closed behind her. As she reached the rest of her party she heard the low rumbling again. She turned and headed back, looking to see what had opened now, only to find the passage to the star chamber only extended a few hundred feet and ended.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She told no one of what she'd seen, beginning to question whether she had seen it. After finding their way out of the mountains she went back to the states.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* rework above - 1*/</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She couldn't shake what she'd seen and after three weeks in ____ she loaded her gear and headed out alone. Her search finally brought her back to the cave and once again the doors opened. This time she followed the corridor to its end, where it emerged into a large control room type place. Nothing she saw was labeled in any way she could understand, so after prowling for a while she went back to Rani Group and formed an investigative team to return and start working at translations. They have been working ever since. Enough has been figured out to provide simple improvements to some technologies, sufficient to increase cash flow. Now the goal is to reconstruct the control area here in vr and allow others access to it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's the official story, right? So what aren't you telling. It sounds like there's more." Traci asked suspiciously. "As soon as the vr setup is complete we’ll show you what the ‘real story’ is. Most of the real story is we don’t know what this place is, where it came from, and all that stuff. It is not like any of the technologies we’ve had access to."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* rework above - 2 - with more data on the Rani herself as well */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">started life as a gifted biologist and was working for a summer in Nepal/India/Bhutan studying snow leopards. She picked up a strange ring at a street vendors shop in Paro. It was obviously a better piece than most of the wares there.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When her team was out near Jhomolhari they took refuge in the fortress ruins near it. During the night she couldn’t sleep and went wondering through it. In the lowest open section was a segment of wall that looked less permanent than the rest. Her attention was drawn to a very faint painting of a man on a flying tiger and a seven point star underneath. Near it was the representation of a mountain looking much like Jhomolhari and a door set into a smaller mound drawn near it - very much like the small hill the ruins sat on. Carefully she rubbed away more dirt and debris until she could seen the entire scrap of painting. The bricks had shifted causing cracks to appear in the plaster beneath the drawing. One set of cracks framed a single brick and the drawing of the door on it. The way the door exactly matched the brick beneath, including a small warp in its top, sparked her curiosity. Without really thinking about what she was doing, she pulled out her pocket knife and used it to gently pry the brick from the wall.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Behind it was the rough stone of the hill and a small dab of plaster. It seemed to fill a tiny spot in the otherwise uniform stone. It was quick work with her knife to pry it loose and reveal a small sculpted indent in the stone. An indent that seemed to mirror the odd rounded seven facetted stone of her new ring.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">found a cave when she was in the mountains working as an assistant to a research project. It piqued her curiosity enough that she went back after the project left the area she explored it somewhat the first day and more thoroughly the second as the weather had closed in with high winds and rain. found the entry areas that time and moved camp back into that area as it was more protected and seemed warmer. next day she found the entry systems and used the funny ring she had to gain entry - was astonished by what she found - decided right then to work extensively to build a team and figure out what it was.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Picked up a ring from a chair in the main control center and slipped it on. As she left there was a blinking red light in the center of the inscribed symbol in the ceiling, it went out when she held the ring in it for a few moments. Somehow this need s to be a partial attunement process</p>
<p class="regtxt5">returned to the states and formed the basis of Rani group with two friends - Magdalena and Sitiri - began marketing a couple of small tech ideas she had found in the complex before her return. on her return she changed her field of study to business admin with an interest in international corporations and methods.</p>
