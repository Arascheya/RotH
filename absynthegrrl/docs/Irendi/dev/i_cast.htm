<p class="pagecaption">Irendi - Cast List</p>
<p class="regtxt9">*Irendi Walker - protagonist, electronics and chief pilot</p>

<p class="regtxt9">*Valarie Jason - Irendi's lover and partner</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valarie - will not allow herself to be a 'kept' woman, feels she MUST contribute monetarily into any partnered living situation, is heterophobic from many bad experiences when younger</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She doesn't trust power structures or men in general, she was raped when she was 16 by a 29 year old cousin. She had trusted him and had told him she thought she might be lesbian. He then forced himself on her, telling her all she needed was the right man.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">No one believed her as he was a rising star in the family business and a respected leader in several community groups. She even tried reporting the incident through channels at her school but nothing came of them. He came after her again and she went for him with a knife. Her family believed him and threw her out. She lived in teen shelters and with friends until she managed to get a job at the apartment complex. At first it was cleaning work, but she was aggressive enough to work her way up. She survived by not trusting anyone.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">
Her parents were emotionally distant and expected perfect performance from her and her sister. Nothing was good enough for them. From little onward they were taught to always be aware that everyone was watching them and that 'people won't like you' if you do things your way instead of theirs. Her father was ex military and treated her and her sister as cadets for the first ten years of life. She has a very deep resentment toward that kind of approach to anything. She will go ballistic at the mere mention of a 'need to know' situation. Her sister is emotionally dead, she goes through the motions of being a housewife and mother but the spark that used to be there is gone. Valarie finds out that her sister went through something similar to her but from younger and for far longer. One of her goals once she becomes part of Rani Corp. is to find all she can on her cousin and destroy him.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">*Magdalena Iranovich - Vice President and Special Projects Chief Engineer, Rani Corp.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Magdalena Iranovich - zoo director for BMC(Bengal Media Corp.), a subsidiary of the Rani Group, VERY informal, wanders around talking with everyone, places her office in a small, unused storeroom until the new facilities are built, then moves into a small, unassuming office there</p>

<p class="regtxt9">*Sitiri Biswas - , Vice President and Chief of Facilities Management, Rani Corp.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">*Traci Armstrong - computers and such - pendant</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Traci - manager of something bogus and unimportant at General Defense, given minimal support and resources because she turned down Jeff's advances, comes across as a ditz at first, but underneath is a fair amount of intelligence, she is very good with computer systems, she helps Irendi crack her way into the Gen. Def. systems after Irendi is fired and helps her remove some of her designs, also helps Irendi track down the real spy in the firm roller blades are her favorite form of non motorized transport.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She programs as art - viewing programs as woven patterns/designs rather than logical steps/blocks. She has a very hard time explaining what she is doing when she’s writing code, this was the second reason she was moved out of programming assignments at General Defense. Has several tattoos, all very artistic and done as single pieces.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Traci has pendant that was given to her by her mother’s mother in Algeria when they were visiting her after her grandfather’s death. Traci was six at the time and the youngest of  3. None of the others were interested at all in being there or in listening to grandmother’s stories of life as a nomad. Traci would sit for hours and listen spellbound as the woman described her childhood and youth. Once when she was showing Traci some of her jewelry Traci looked at a 7 pointed star pendant and said, "Grandma, that’s my necklace."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her grandmother replied, "Of course it is dear, I was keeping it safe for you. May it bring you good fortune."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After that the bond between them became even deeper, lasting until her grandmother’s death 12 years later.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">grandmother was from area around Zerhamra near the grand erg occidental and the oued saoura</p>

<p class="regtxt9">*Kilashandra Mason ‘Shan’</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kilashandra Mason ‘Shan’ - is Traci’s lover. Kind of different, rather distracted and different. She wears colored extensions in her hair and will clip her ID to them, drives security types nuts till they come to understand - although most are more cool than in most other places. Tends to favor bright colors and strange decorations. Not big on tattoos or permanent body art</p>

<p class="regtxt9">*Alan - Irendi’s last boyfriend, the best of a mediocre lot, under psych care for shooting at a werecat</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Alan - nice but kind of geeky. Fairly sensitive for a guy.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">*Jeff - head of GED section Irendi worked in</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jeff - womanizer, somewhat chauvinistic, interested in Irendi, especially after she starts to dress better, did not try to displace Jerry for her because Jerry had better contacts in upper management, has everyone in his division watched - security/espionage concerns, takes it a little too far - farther with females, not so much mysogenistic as he feels he's god's gift to women, homophobic, especially about lesbians because he cannot understand why a woman would prefer another woman over him, does not believe women can perform as well as men on the job, emotional, health issues, pregnancy, etc.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">*Jack - head stooge and actual spy in GED</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jack - head stooge and actual spy in GED, agent for opposition government, true misogynist, feeds Jeff's phobia and paranoia, enjoys watching/spying on people, motive is more for the thrill of it, not as much for money or ideology, once Jeff feels rejected by Irendi he attempts to finger her as the spy, he likes Jeff a lot</p>

<p class="regtxt9">*Dave - flight ops specialist, stolen from Meriksa space agency</p>

<p class="regtxt9">*Vashi Kalashandra Ristan - director/owner of Rani Corp. - she started it, she runs it - she has the thought crystal ring from the high elder of the evacuation</p>
