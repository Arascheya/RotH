Message from Sir Howard Stringer
----------------------------

Dear Colleagues,?????

Today marks a significant turning point in the history of the Company, and it 
is?????
not just because we have a new management team in place that is digitally 
savvy,?????
globally experienced and determined to connect to customers that are 
reinventing?????
their future and their personal aspirations every day in the digital, 
networked world.?????

As we begin the new fiscal year, we are doing two difficult but very important?????
things simultaneously. First, we are reconstructing the company to eliminate 
the?????
duplication you have long criticized, to simplify many of the vital processes 
that?????
have sent our fixed costs dangerously high in many areas, including in 
purchasing?????
and in manufacturing. Second, we are finally transforming the company into the?????
premier provider of networked products, content and services for the highly?????
selective and demanding consumers of 2009 and beyond. This is not an easy 
task,?????
but there is clearly no other choice, and our management is aligned, united 
and?????
committed to make these changes.?????

Some of you who have experienced other reorganizations at Sony are probably?????
thinking you've heard similar messages in the past---similar promises.?????
And so you may ask, "Why is this different?"?????

As you know, our competitive environment is tougher than ever before. 
Panasonic,?????
Sharp and Samsung are there, of course, but also Apple, Microsoft and now 
Cisco,?????
as well as numerous small boutique companies that nibble away at our core 
markets?????
with increasing ferocity, boldness and effectiveness.?????

To be truly competitive, we must strengthen the pillars of the Sony edifice?????
so that television, digital imaging, "PlayStation", mobile entertainment, 
broadcast?????
and professional, audio and video can be more powerful, but we must also 
recognize?????
new seductive products beckoning to our customers---IPTV, 3-D, digital cinema,?????
social networking---and make our own special mark. The list lengthens daily.?????

In the coming weeks and months, you will be hearing directly from the new 
management?????
team about Sony's strategic priorities across all of our businesses. These 
strategies?????
will establish a clear direction for the Company, taking into account the new 
market?????
realities and maximizing the value of the talent, creativity and energy that 
resides?????
within all of you.?????

Under the reorganization, the Sony consumer electronics and game organizations 
are?????
now comprised of two strong groups:  the new Consumer Products & Devices group 
and?????
the Networked Products & Services group. The first group represents our 
traditional?????
and vital hardware; the second will provide new network differentiation which,?????
when married to our hardware, will make us truly competitive. The brilliance 
of?????
our hardware engineers will be fortified by the versatility and originality of?????
our software engineers, and the "PlayStation Network" will connect our 
products and?????
services to all our customers. In the past, this effort has been a forced 
marriage?????
with few open platforms, inconsistent strategy and too little commitment.?????

Today, the network is operational. It runs smoothly, and our network 
engineers,?????
whether in "VAIO" or Sony Computer Entertainment or elsewhere, are committed?????
to working together. With our newly empowered, horizontal technology, 
procurement?????
and logistics groups, we will march forward with better efficiency, speed and?????
technical coordination, enabling us to provide brilliant consumer solutions at?????
an affordable cost.?????

All of these initiatives will be linked closely with our content companies?????
so that the Sony customer will have the very best hardware, software, services?????
and entertainment. And all will benefit from new efficiencies in the 
component,?????
semiconductor, disc manufacturing and B2B solutions businesses, as well.?????

Over the next few weeks, the new management team will be pushing through 
changes?????
that brush aside old and stubborn obstacles.  You will be tempted to say?????
"that won't work" or "that's not how we did it in the past." But remember,?????
the recent past just brought us to the edge of a cliff. Our founders knew that?????
Sony needed to adapt to the changes taking place around them. When we did,?????
we soared brilliantly.?????

We need to change. It will be an interactive, company-wide process, led by a 
team,?????
because one individual alone cannot shatter silos and liberate the creativity 
of?????
a great company. That team needs your support. It needs you to join forces and?????
enlist in the cause, so that the terrible threats exposed by this giant 
recession?????
can never again challenge Sony's survival or its right to exist.?????

We watched the World Baseball Classic last week as the Japanese baseball team-
--?????
a group of players from different teams, different leagues and different parts 
of?????
the world---came together, applied their talents and skills to a common 
purpose and,?????
in magnificent fashion, made their country proud on the world's stage.?????

As the inspirational author Alan Cohen once said, "It takes a lot of courage 
to?????
release the familiar and seemingly secure, to embrace the new.  But there is 
not real?????
security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the 
adventurous?????
and exciting, for in movement there is life, and in change there is power."?????

So, I say to you, release the familiar, embrace the new, and get excited about?????
what Sony is doing because we are the most powerful technology and 
entertainment?????
brand in the world. And we are determined to prevail!?????


Howard Stringer?????
Chairman, CEO and President?????
