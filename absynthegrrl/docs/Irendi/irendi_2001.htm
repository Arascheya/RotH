<p class="pagecaption">Irendi - Chapter 1</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Alan’s body was curled up around her, for once the love making had almost been good. As she lay there a strange tingly feeling began to build within her, then came an incredible urge to purr. The tingling grew stronger and spread with an underlying pain/pleasure feeling and a wonderful warm glow. She closed her eyes and just enjoyed until Alan's screams jerked her eyes open. Adrenaline shot through her as she rose into a crouch. He was across the room, shaking and fumbling in his dresser for something. She called his name and heard only a cat's roar. At that moment he pulled a pistol from the drawer and swung it her way. She sprang aside, landing several feet from the bed, facing the bathroom mirror through the door. Instead of herself there was only a large leopard crouched in the room. As he lined the gun on her again she leapt past him, crashed through the bedroom window and landed in the alley below.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She landed in a heap as she fought with unfamiliar muscles. She was struggling to her feet as the first shot whanged off the pavement near her. Terror brought her to her feet and she was off, running down the alley. Acrid smells assaulted her and harsh screaming sounds pounded her ears. Every time she just about had the fear under control something else would startle her and she'd be off again. Panicked, she hurtled through the streets, dodging metal monsters and screaming people. She ran until her flanks were heaving and every breath was a firebrand, then she walked some more until she found a culvert. Exhausted, she curled up and slept.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The next morning she awoke cold, naked, and famished. Scared and numb with cold, she crawled deeper into the culvert, only just seeing the wino in time not to wake him. Gingerly she crawled around him until she was lost in the deep shadows. Confused and frightened she tried to figure out how she had gotten here. There were vague images in her mind of running, hiding, and running again. Her last clear memory was Alan curled around her after lovemaking. For once it had been almost good. For once there had been a drowsy, almost sated glow, and the overwhelming urge to purr. The next clear image was looking out the end of the culvert this morning onto an empty, weed-covered expanse.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her mind rebelled against the vague images and scraps of memory. This was reality, shape shifting and things like that weren’t a part of it. The only explanation had to be she was trapped in a dream and had only dreamed of waking. She tried to force herself to wake up. She tried to pinch herself and found she could, and it hurt. Nothing changed the image in front of her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> After long minutes of trying she gave up and began to take stock of her surroundings. There was a sleeping person between her and the culvert entrance. Behind her she could see a small streak of light. Concentrating she could see the bends and folds where the metal had partially collapsed. A large rock lay between her and the worst of the collapse. The remaining opening was far too small for anything bigger than an average house cat. Still not quite believing she concentrated on the tingling she had felt last night. Every time she looked at it, it would skitter away, withdrawing to a place where she couldn’t reach it. Lost in thought she had ignored the partial obscuring of the slitted light as the ‘rock’ moved. A leering male voice startled her back to her surroundings, "Well, and what have we here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Fear coursed through her as she heard shuffling movement from deeper in the culvert. "I know what you need, I'll be right there." As her fear passed into terror she felt a sharp, angry tension building deep within, then a hot glow as pins and needles shot through her. She heard a sharp intake of breath as the shuffling stopped. Scared, she let out her loudest scream, only to hear a deafening yowl echo through the pipe. "Oh my god! No, please, no."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I could smell his fear, he was so close. My muscles ached to rip and tear, to rend and shake, to play with this toy. Without thought I stalked forward as the pleading rose in volume. His fear caressed me, building a delicious tension in every muscle as I crouched to pounce. My tail twitched in anticipation, only to catch momentarily on a torn piece of the culvert. It hit me then, "TAIL?? I don't have a tail."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Pain pounded through my head as I fought to relax out of the pounce and try and take stock. It was agony to think through the pounding desires, but as I struggled it slowly became easier, until the anticipation receded to a dull ache. Still I could remember very little. Emotions and instincts crowded forward, all but obscuring logic. With another menacing yowl I forced myself to retreat slowly down the tunnel, carefully stepping over the still inert wino. I ran again as the hunting desire flared again, calling me to return and enjoy the kill. Instincts served me well, keeping me away from open spaces and places of likely discovery. I ran for the park, hoping I could find a quiet, concealed place.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This time I climbed a tree and curled up on a large branch. The bright sun warmed my fur. Sensuously, I stretched out to the warmth. A rumbling started deep inside. It took several minutes to recognize I was purring. Peaceful calm washed over me and I drifted into a light nap.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sharp pains woke me after a time. My neck was cramped and something was gouging my side. I started to roll, only to grab frantically as I started to fall. Disoriented I looked around, finding tree branches everywhere. It took a moment to realize how I had gotten here. Never one for heights I scrambled for the largest safest feeling part of the tree and sat gasping for breath. Confusion and despair chased through me. I didn't know how to get home. No one would believe me if I went to the police. None of my friends would believe me, unless I could show them, and that would likely get me shot, or worse. I sat morose and alone until evening came and deepened into night. Shivering, I huddled against the tree, then it came to me, maybe I could mug a mugger, go buy clothes and get home. Now it sounds really foolish, but then it seemed like inspiration. All I had to do was change and take down a mugger. Then I stopped again. What if I couldn't
control myself and I killed him? What would I do when I changed back? I couldn't live with that. As the night grew colder I began to realize I would just have to try it and find out. I would have to find out sooner or later if I could control this anyway.
</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once again I probed for the source of the tingles. I forced and forced, pushed and fought with my mind, all to no avail. Finally I gave up and started to think of what my other options might be. As I concentrated on them I felt a small spark, somewhere deep down. I tried to remember everything I had heard about relaxation exercises and meditation. It wasn't much, I had never really paid much attention. All I could remember were breathing exercises so I tried them. I forced myself to breath slowly and deeply, trying to concentrate only on the breathing. The spreading of the glow distracted me. As soon as I reached for it, it disappeared again. Encouraged, I started again. Deliberately I ignored the growing tingles, concentrating on breathing. Soon the tingles started to spread, generating the pleasure/pain feelings again. I continued to breath, but reached out to embrace the feelings. They built to orgasmic intensity, then passed, leaving me vibrant and alive, standing on four feet in the tree. This time I took the time to examine myself as well as I could. I was beautiful. I had graceful, well formed forelegs, strong, well muscled shoulders, a flat belly tapering into powerful hind legs. Muscles rippled and flowed under my tawny pelt. Luxuriating in the feel of the body I leapt gracefully to the ground. Letting out quiet sounds of pleasure I experimented with moving and sensations, finally taking a leisurely roll in the grass. Tasting the smells and sounds of the night I quietly stalked through the moon and street lit park.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I heard the screams from a long way away. Instantly I was on the move, the hunting instincts to the fore. Silently and swiftly I closed the distance until I came to the grouping of bushes where the struggle was taking place. Almost I turned and left, it was not a mugging, only a mating. As I turned away part of me pushed into awareness, bringing with it the vague concept of rape. Shaken by my disinterest, I turned again and stalked toward the scene. As I saw him raise the knife I let out a loud roar of rage and sprang. Fear rooted him to the spot as I hurtled into him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The knife fell from his useless fingers as he dropped to the ground, unmoving. My teeth were on his throat and my jaws were moving in before I could exert enough will to stop them. The taste of salt and fear sweat was overwhelming. I longed for the coppery salt flavor of blood, the delicious warmth of a fresh kill. Salivating in anticipation my jaws began to close again. A small part of me fought with the sensations, shoving and screaming until the pounding ache again began to clear from my head.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shaking from the effort of the battle, I forced my jaws to open again. There were four small punctures in his throat, slowly oozing blood, where my canines had broken the skin. Shaken, I slunk back. Watching him, I moved to the woman. She appeared unharmed yet didn't stir. Gently I nudged her until she began to moan, then sprinted for cover. I watched a few minutes as she took in the scene, then ran. Frightened by how near a thing it had been, but encouraged that I could control the instincts, I returned to stalking the park.
</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Time had no meaning in cat form so I couldn't say when I heard the next commotion. Once again I darted through the shadows to the pool of darkness where a man stood kicking another. "I'll teach you to pull a knife on me." With that I heard a sickening crack as the man's foot slammed into the downed fellow's ribs. Rage burned through me, releasing the huntress again. I flew at the attacker. My shoulder hit him in the throat as my powerful hind legs launched me off his falling body. His torn shirt couldn't conceal the entrails leaking from his shredded abdomen. Screaming, he dropped, pathetically trying to hold himself together. The screams lasted an eternity as I shook with reaction and hunger.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Fear and anguish fought with battle joy and appetite while I paced to and from the body, drawn by the fresh kill smell, and repelled by what I had done. Later part of me rejoiced at one mugger who would never escape justice, but I am not a killer, nor do I ever want to kill again. Especially that way. Still fighting with the cat's desires, I slunk into the night. When the next sounds reached me, I refused to move for long moments, then need brought me to my feet again.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This time I forced myself to approach slowly. Fighting all the while with the urge to run and pounce. I came on the scene as the mugger was strolling away from the inert victim. A quick sniff showed she still lived. On silent paws I paced him through the park, slinking along in the brush beside him. As he neared a particularly dark part I let forth a low, challenging growl. Startled, he peered about. Playfully I swatted a bush near me. He stopped and pulled a long knife. Crouching he watched the brush nervously, but I had already moved farther on. The cat struggled forward again, enjoying the game. I still fought the huntress, but a kittenishness slipped out. Another soft growl spun the man around. Now he was sweating, again I could smell the fear. Like a drug it washed through me, driving me back with the intensity of the tension. I caught myself just before I pounced, causing a terrible crashing as I flopped into a bush. The man backed against a large maple tree and stared at the bushes. Elated I padded around to the other side of the tree and leapt to the low branches. Slithering through the bows I crept to a spot just above him. With a night shattering roar I dropped down on him. For an instant his face registered shock before his head hit the ground and the eyes rolled back. Again I fought not to complete the kill, but this time it was slightly easier.
</p>
<p class="regtxt5">All I had to do was change back, take the money from the woman's purse, and his clothes, and get back to my apartment. One small problem, how to change back. I tried to reach the glow, but the killing desire was too strong to allow me to relax. I heard a movement then, a small scuffling in the undergrowth. Quickly I swung around and glimpsed a black dog sniffing at a bush. Before I could think I was after it. The chase was short, the kill quick. The warm, juicy meat slid easily down my throat, blunting the ravenous hunger. Reveling in the tastes and textures I made short work of my kill. Slowly I drowsed off.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The cold woke me. I had changed again. As I stood I saw the few remaining bits of dog strewn over the grass. Blood still coated my hands where I had ripped at the carcass. Stomach churning, I vomited pieces of dog. Frantically I wiped my hands through the grass, but I couldn't get all the blood off. Still nauseous, I crept toward the unconscious mugger. With shaking hands I emptied the money from the purse and slipped his clothes from him. He was starting to moan and twitch as I pulled on his clothes and ran for the edge of the park.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At the nearest street light I took stock of my haul. I had maybe enough for cab fare. I would go as far as I could, then walk if I had to. It took several tries before a cab would stop for my shabby figure. Even then he was less than polite, demanding the money up front. Spacey from shock and exhaustion I didn't even protest. Thinking back I guess I figured I could always change and take it back.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I had to walk the last six blocks to my apartment. Nervously I knocked on the door marked Valerie Jason, superintendent. I had met her a couple of times, but wasn't sure what to expect at this time of night. "Who is it? What do you want?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's Irendi Walker, from apartment 217, I've been robbed and need to get into my apartment." She opened the door with a police baton in hand. She quickly took in the blood caked around my mouth and the clothes I was wearing. Quickly she motioned me in as she finished pulling on her robe. She opened my room, fixed me a hot bath, helped clean me up, and even brought some food. I could tell she was curious at finding no obvious wounds near my lips to account for the blood on my face. She gave me a fierce grin of approval when I told her I had bitten the mugger, that's how I was able to get away. Later she offered to stay while I called the police. It took a lot of work to convince her I really would call them if she left. The food went untouched, somehow I still couldn't face the thought of eating.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The few short hours remaining passed in a haze of nightmares. I was late for work, even makeup couldn't hide the dark circles under my eyes, and my haunted expression. In self defense I had to tell the mugging story again. As I was finishing up Jeff motioned everybody into his office. "Listen, they're talking about the cat again."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Fear surged through me as I collapsed into a chair. "...police are still searching for signs of the cat that killed at least one person last night. Reports are still coming in of sightings throughout the western sections of the city. The zoo has been notified but reports none of their animals are missing. We go now to Walter Mathews, at the scene of the brutal killing." Shaking, I buried my face in my hands as the camera pulled back, revealing a body bag being loaded into an ambulance. "The victim of the mugging has already been removed from the scene. His statement to the police says he was saved by a giant cat leaping onto his assailant and slaying him. The cat was said to have been behaving very strangely after the killing, pacing to the body and away, then it vanished into the night."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"De, are you all right?" Jack had noticed me huddled in the chair.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, I ... I was in that park, that's where I was mugged."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"My god, that's terrible. I'm glad you got out alive. I hope they find that creature, before someone else gets hurt."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Did you see the cat?" Tracy, tactful as always, began the third degree. I could feel her disappointment when I said I hadn't.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Just as I started to relax the news switched again. "We take you now to the quiet uptown area known as Hillview. This morning police escorted Alan Waters from his home after neighbors complained of small arms fire. He was led away shouting a disjointed story of his girlfriend turning into a cat after lovemaking. He has been taken to the city jail, where he will be evaluated by a team of psychiatrists to determine if he is mentally fit for trial." Terror clawed at my guts as a sharp tension started to build. A hot glow was spreading through me. Frantically I focused on breathing, then on the flowers on Jack's desk. Long moments hung in the balance as I willed the change not to happen. Shaking, I stood and excused myself to the ladies room. Tracy, ever the pain, trailed along behind. "Here let me help you." Fighting with the change my hand curled to release my claws, as my lips began to pull back in a snarl. Desperately I changed the motion into a grab for the wall. Claws? Looking at my hand thankfully nothing had changed. She "helped" me to the restroom, then stood nervously watching as I splashed cold water on my face, trying to cool the heat. Ten minutes later I was able to get back to my office.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The day passed in a distracted haze. I couldn't concentrate on anything. The air seemed oppressive and stuffy, the room was too warm, and the lights too bright and harsh. Midway through the afternoon Jack stuck his head in to say the radar countermeasures transmitter deadline had been moved up three weeks. Great, one more headache.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">That night when I got home Valerie was waiting for me. She had a police baton with her and offered to teach me how to use it. I almost laughed in her face at that. I barely held the hysteria in check as we entered my apartment and she began her instruction. I didn't have the heart to chase her out, I knew she wanted badly to help. During breaks we talked a little. I watched as well as I could through the confused thoughts running in my head. I awkwardly copied her moves and after several hours she felt I at least had an idea of what to do. She promised to come by again tomorrow. When she left I ran to the balcony door and threw it open. I switched off all the lights and stood out in the air, trying to escape the feelings of confinement I was beginning to have.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I paced the balcony for several hours until lack of sleep finally caught up with me. The night passed with fewer nightmares, but I still awoke several times with the mugger's screams echoing in my ears. I gave up at last and got up to pace the apartment, then out onto the balcony. Even that was too small, so I headed out and prowled the neighborhood until the first light told me it was time to get ready for work.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The next couple of weeks passed in a fog of trying to cope at work and trying to cope at night. Valerie came over often, at first to continue the baton work, then more to talk and hang out. She seemed as lonely in her own way as I was. By the second week we were best of friends. Thinking about it maybe everyone was right, maybe I was too much of a technogeek, too busy with computers and designs to do much else. Alan had started to change all that, although I had started to slip into his world, letting him decide more and more what we would do and what life goals we had.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Things were slowly getting better, although I still wasn’t sleeping well. I’d either wake to dreams of torn bodies or the stunned look on Alan’s face as the police led him away. I wanted to talk to Valerie about it, but how could I start, //Hi, I can turn into a cat and a few weeks ago...yeah, right...//.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Times came when I was so tense that sleep wasn’t possible at all. On those nights I’d fight to turn into the cat and then I’d prowl the streets. Sometimes I made it, sometimes I didn’t. On the nights when I didn’t I’d be impossible at work the next day. PMS had nothing on this. The news continued to report on the cat prowling whenever I’d accidentally get spotted, but as the frequency didn’t increase and no more attacks happened they began to ignore it more and more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Three weeks after the episode I finally collapsed from exhaustion, drifting out in the middle of a TV movie we had been watching. Valerie managed to wake me enough to help me to bed. I thought I felt a certain hesitancy as she helped me, but put it down to exhaustion.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In the morning I awoke to a warm stickiness on my thighs and the screaming hornies. Damn, I had forgotten about my period. As I cleaned up I grew even more horny, nothing seemed to help. I tried every technique I knew, but the relief only lasted for a few moments. Soon I was pacing around the room, strange sort of mewling sounds tumbling from my throat. Scared, I looked in the mirror, only to see two green cat eyes staring back from my face. Was it my imagination or had my hair grown thicker. Fear licking at the edges of my awareness, I leapt for the phone. Hurriedly I called work. My voice was coarse and husky as I gave Tracy the message. As I set the phone down I saw tawny fur starting to cover my hand as the warm glow surged through me again. I bit at my tongue not to give cry to the ecstasy of the change and my incredible need. The heat in my groin was overwhelming. I needed it BAD, I needed it NOW. I had thought the hunting instinct was bad, it was nothing in comparison. I paced the room. I couldn't hold or use any of my toys and nothing else presented a solution. I tried the bedpost, it helped a little, but not nearly enough. I paced to the balcony door and fought it open. Looking from the balcony I could easily leap down to the carport, question was, could I get back up later. I fought with myself, forcing myself to wait until no one seemed to be watching, then leapt. The brief flight soothed me a little. All my life I had wanted to move with this much grace and form. Quickly I moved into the shadows and forced myself to wait for another quiet point. I darted out and sprang for my balcony. It was a close thing, I balanced precariously on the narrow rail for long seconds until I figured how to shift my weight enough to move forward into the room. Euphoria drifted through me as I leapt back down to the street. I dodged, wove, and slithered my way toward the zoo. Somehow I had to get into the cats, I had to find relief.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I made it to the zoo with no major difficulties. From my position in a tree I could see the leopard areas in the distance. The closeness brought my need up even further. Thinking was becoming impossible, yet I still managed to realize I couldn't just stroll in and hope to be put in with the others. That small part of me still could make itself heard. With a suppressed scream of frustration I began the journey home.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I had just landed in my living room when a knock came at the door, followed by Valerie’s voice calling. Silently I paced, trying to think how to force a change. Suddenly I heard her key in the lock, "De, are you there? Are you ok?" A panicked leap carried me into the bathroom. I managed to kick the door closed behind me. She continued to call as she came in. I heard the door close as my sensitive ears tracked her around the kitchen. Fear overrode everything else when her hand touched the bathroom door. Worry colored her voice as she opened it and reached for the light. Pain seared through my head as the light snapped on. I heard her gasp before I saw her stumble back, baton clutched and ready. Even the huntress admired her lack of fear. The taste of it was there, but very low. Determination was on her face as she slowly backed toward the phone. As her hand closed on the receiver, I leapt past her, grabbed the cord with my teeth, and yanked it out of the wall.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She scrambled into a defensible corner, her fear scent growing slightly stronger. The huntress stirred, but I fought her back as I also saw curiosity in her eyes. I rifled through my vague memories, looking for any image of a happy, peaceful cat. When I found one, I tried to take it on, although the image of a happy, playful leopard was probably not the most reassuring. Slowly I sank to the floor and tried to purr. The I rolled onto my back and tried to look non threatening.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We stayed locked in that image for long minutes, until her curiosity edged her closer. More minutes passed until she was within paw distance, then within her reach. With great care she reached out and touched my head. Savoring the touch, I gently moved into it. Soon she was scratching behind my ears and saying those meaningless things people always say to animals. I concentrated on those feelings. For the first time since morning the need receded enough that I could start to ignore it. I allowed the drowsy feeling to come on, even as part of me feared her reaction to the change.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A sharp hissing of breath brought me back. I was naked on the floor, stretched out as I had been as the cat. Valerie was back in her corner staring at me. Tears of relief flooded down my cheeks as I moved to a sitting position. "Thank you. I didn't know if I could get back."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You...you're the cat, but HOW??"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't KNOW how." Frustrated, but relieved to be back, I babbled on about what had happened, not caring what she thought, just needing to talk about it. As I reached the part about my period and my incredible horniness, she actually laughed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What do you expect? Remember, cats only mate when they are in heat." It hit me then, too. It really wasn't funny, but at the time it seemed hysterical. I laughed till I was rolling around on the floor, she did too. We ended up talking half the night. I couldn't explain much to her, but talking through everything made it easier to think about.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I wondered why you didn't seem victimized, only traumatized, when you showed up at my door..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As I grew more relaxed talking with her I began to really look at her. At first I didn't catch on to what was happening. At first I was just admiring her physique, the muscles I remembered seeing during her teaching the past nights, then I noticed her hair, black and cut short, midway down her small ears. She was wearing a curious pair of earrings, two interlinked female symbols. Then I was examining her face, oval, with blue eyes set close to her pert little nose. Her mouth, wide and sensuous, quick with a smile and a laugh. It slipped up on me then. First I blushed as she caught me staring at her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Then an overwhelming agony of need swept through me again. "Oh god, no, not again." Sweat beaded my forehead as the fire began to spread from my groin. "The need, I think I'm changing again." I fought with it, concentrating on the man I killed. That helped a little bit. As the fire grew hotter and my vision started to blur I felt a delicious sensation spreading from my flaming core. The fire dimmed slightly, easing the blurring of my vision. I felt arms around me and fingers stroking me, gentle, yet demanding. Tantalizing pressures, teasing tickles and soft kisses on my neck and ears changed the flames as a massive orgasm surged through me. Spent, I collapsed toward the floor, only to be held be strong arms. Slowly I was lowered to the floor where I lay, stretched catlike on the carpet, purring as well as I could through my human throat. I could hold the warm tingles at bay as I twisted and rolled to look at Valerie. She had moved to a chair, far from me, and was huddled in it, knees pulled up to her chest, and crying. "I'm sorry. I couldn't resist you. I wanted to help, but when I touched you I couldn't stop. Please forgive me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I crawled over to the chair and curled up catlike next to it. Without thinking I gently rubbed my cheek against her thigh. I reached up and took her hand, licking and kissing it before placing it against my other cheek. Her head came up from her knees and she looked at me through teary eyes. Slowly I stood, leaned down, and licked her tears away. She looked curiously at me as she stood. Hesitantly I pulled her into my arms. Her warmth ignited the flames again. Frantically I tugged at her sweater, then fumbled at her belt. In moments we were on the floor, bucking and rolling against each other. Our screams rose, mingled, and faded away. Dazed, we collapsed into a sweaty heap.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The next days passed in a haze of need. I finally realized I was in Valerie’s apartment the third night of my period. That night we made love because I wanted to, not because I had to. The next morning I headed back to work. Morning passed in a blaze of activity, projects to catch up on and meetings to attend. By lunch time I was tired and tired of it. The rest of the day was agony, the office seemed airless, the lights were too harsh, and everyone's voices sounded more like chattering than words. Head pounding, I longed for quitting time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The drive home was even worse. I could barely focus through the pain in my head. The fumes from other cars churned my stomach, and the blaring of horns shot firebrands through my brain. I stumbled to my apartment, almost missing the note from Valerie that was taped to the door. In the apartment I sagged into a chair and stared at the note for long minutes, unable even to open it. Finally the pain eased enough that I could undo the tape and read her message. It was an invite to dinner. My stomach responded first, reminding me that lunch had been long ago, and not satisfying. The hamburger I'd eaten hadn't survived a violent bout of nausea shortly afterward. I gagged down several aspirin and slowly eased my way down the hall. If I moved slowly enough my head would almost leave me alone.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her door opened at the first knock. Smiling, she led me into her place and sat me at the table. The lights were off with candles providing the only illumination. Soft music was playing on the stereo. She moved behind me and began gently massaging the base of my skull, her strong fingers working wonders with the knots and cables that had replaced my muscles. After long moments my neck relaxed enough for my head to roll back against her arms and a soft sigh slipped past my lips. The now familiar change glow started deep within, but held itself in the background. Valerie held my head until I finally pulled it forward again, then bent and softly kissed my hair. "Shall we eat now?" she said with a smile. Suddenly I was ravenous. With another smile she vanished into her kitchen, only to emerge with lasagna and salad. Both were meatless and both were exquisite. I gorged, surprised at how much I put away. I turned red when she asked, "Are you sure your finished?" after my third plate full had disappeared.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She wouldn't let me do anything, just insisted that I sit and relax. When everything had been cleared away she returned with two mugs of herb tea and set them near the couch. Almost torpid from eating, she had to help me to the couch. Once again I marveled at the strength of her. Smiling once more she talked of her day, then asked about me. The warm tea finished relaxing me. Several times I found my eyes drifting closed as she talked. Embarrassed, I would quickly slide them open again, trying to hide my exhaustion from her. I tried to explain it, but couldn't, I just couldn't stay awake. At last I stood and mumbled an apology, heading toward the door. She took my arm and led me to her room instead, "You can stay here you know. I wouldn't mind the company." She helped me undress, then helped me fall into the bed. I think she held me then, but I was already mostly asleep.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I awoke early in the morning, slightly before sunrise. I was asleep, then I was wide awake. I've never been able to do that. For a few moments I lay listening to Valerie’s quiet breathing, enjoying her closeness, then restlessness pulled me from the bed. Silently I padded to the closet and grabbed one of her robes. Still without a sound, I opened her balcony door and slipped out, closing it softly behind me. I stood, letting the crisp morning air cool and soothe me. The change glow had become stronger, building as the fresh morning air cooled me. I began to pace along the short expanse, frustrated, without really knowing why.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My movements must have disturbed Valerie because she joined me then, asking at my pacing. Frustrated, I let vent to an angry explanation of feeling trapped, closed in, crushed by everything and everyone. I didn't see her reactions then, I didn't even hear her words right away, "You don't have to stay, you know. I thought you liked me, I thought you wanted to be here. You can go anytime you want."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The sound of the door closing brought me around. A single leap took me to the door and a sweep of my arm thrust it open. Then I was across the room, holding her tight, licking her tears away. "Valerie, oh Valerie, that's not what I meant. I'm sorry." I led her back to the bed and sat, holding her to me. I tried to explain the need to run, to change, to feel the air across my fur, because that was the frustration, the anger. I hated being caged in a room all day while the sun shone outside. I hated my apartment where I couldn't get away from prying eyes enough to change and run. Once again I found I had let go of her and was pacing the room like a caged cat. She watched me through concerned eyes. Finally she quietly said, "I know of something we might be able to do."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her words stopped me and spun me to face her. Hope surged through me as I said, "You do? Please tell me!" I moved to sit with her again, taking her hand in mine as she detailed her thoughts. She had found an old farm, not far from the city, that she longed to buy. On her own she could never afford it, but with the help of a room mate, maybe something could be made to work. She offered to show me the place, if I was interested. Her breath exploded from her as I grabbed her and bear hugged her. "YES, as soon as possible." The cat stirred within, as the change glow built again. "Please..." I added with a whimper.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hurrying, laughing and carrying on, we scrambled to her car. A short drive brought us to an overgrown drive with a for sale sign. It lead through a stand of hedge into a secluded yard. A weather worn farmhouse and barn faced each other across the yard, overgrown fields stretched off, about 20 acres worth. I grabbed Valerie and spun around, drinking in the warmth of the sun, the fresh air, and the empty space. "Oh babe, I love it! Oh SHIT..." The change slammed through me, barely leaving enough time to strip. Valerie watched fascinated as the glow surged and faded, leaving the cat in its wake. Free at last I sprinted for the fields. The sun warmed my fur as the tall grass caressed it. Reveling in the sensations I ran. Finally I tired, walking slowly back to the house. Valerie was curled up on the front steps reading. She smiled when she saw me stalking back. "Have a good run?" I threw back my head and roared my pleasure. Sated, I curled up on the grass, beginning to drowse into the change.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Still drowsing I heard a car approaching as I felt grass against my skin. Panicked, I scurried for a large bush as Valerie grabbed my clothes. A realtor pulled into the drive then. He emerged, dragging a young couple with him. Startled, he moved to Valerie and they talked a few minutes. I longed then for the cat's ears, wondering what he was saying. Then he took the young couple into the house. In their absence Valerie tossed me my clothes and I quickly dressed. When they emerged I had joined Valerie on the porch. They gave a quick look at the barn, then left. As they drove away Valerie turned to me, smiling. Silently she showed me his card, pointing at the small pink triangle. "He says there might be a way we could work a partnership agreement where we could combine our assets and buy this place! If you want to that is..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I grabbed her in a tight embrace, tears running down my cheeks. "I'd love to! If you could put up with me..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think I can, I really want to try"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We drove slowly back to the city, lost in our own thoughts. My mind was in a whirl, was I really ready for another relationship, especially one involving commitment. I liked Valerie, a lot, but the old fears surged again. Would I lose myself again, just like every other time, convinced the only way it could work was to become what the other person wanted. There was also the speed with which this had happened. We’d only been seeing each other for almost a month. Then too, she was a woman. I'd never even thought of myself as bi, let alone lesbian, yet I felt safe with her, and strong somehow. Thinking of her brought a smile. Almost automatically I reached out and rested my hand on hers, feeling its strength and warmth.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She smiled back, blowing a kiss. The warmth in her eyes tugged at my heart, good idea or no, I knew I had to try. Her look turned puzzled, "How does it  feel? Does it hurt when you change?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Startled, I thought a moment, "No, its a delicious sort of pins and needles glow, almost like sex. If I try and stop it, its like a nagging need, not pain exactly, just an incredible urge, almost overwhelming."</p>
