<p class="pagecaption">Seraphina - Her Story</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I loved my mom, I just couldn't be like her. She was the daughter of circus and carnival folk, but she ran from it as soon as she could. All she ever wanted was to be normal. She married Daniel Arnstien and settled in to life as a wife and later, a stay at home mom. My earliest memories are of her being extremely happy, until dad was killed by a drunk driver one night. Then she had to go back into the work force and try to make enough to support us.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We lived a few houses down from my great-aunt Petra, a fortune teller, who had retired from the carnival circuit. I stayed with Petra most days when my mom was at work. She told me magical stories of her life and fed my hunger for things that weren't what my mom craved. She also showed me her tricks for reading fortunes. It was all about reading the reactions of the mark, then pushing in the directions they hinted at, while pretending to stare into the crystal ball on the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petra first let me try, with a friend of hers, when I was eight years old. I sat at the table, unfocused and stared into the ball. Images immediately formed in my head about her friend. I zeroed in on her main trouble of the day and walked her through several possibilities, all without giving a single thought to the tricks. Her friend paid double and walked out smiling. Petra looked shaken and a bit scared when she looked up. "How did you do that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Know exactly what she wanted? You didn't ask any of the questions I gave you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I remember looking at her, completely puzzled, and replying, "I could see her thoughts and where they were focused."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What am I concerned about right now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I unfocused, without even glancing at the ball, and said, "You wonder what I will think of you, now that I know you are a fake." I ran to her, before she could freak out too much, climbed into her lap, and wrapped my arms around her neck. "I love you. You help people. And you gave me something awesome!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't tell your mom, ok? She wouldn't be happy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know. Mom wants me to be just like her, even though I can't. I can pretend ok though. Can you show me the cards?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't need them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, but they're so pretty."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petra used the traditional Wyder and Wrathie deck, made popular by books and movies. Once I understood the symbology, I drew my own deck. It was crude, since my eight year old art skills were poor, but it led to improvements every year.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Those were happy days, lasting from when I could first toddle to Petra's place until I predicted her death when I was ten. It was cancer, fast, virulent, and caused by asbestos she had come in contact with thirty years before. I was devastated and inconsolable. That's when my mom moved us to Savnaugh.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mom had formed a relationship with a wealthy man there. I'm not sure how it happened, but I hadn't been paying much attention. The move was a blessing and a curse. I was the new kid in school and it sucked. I also found Madam Iyasha's Grove, a vudahn and reading shop run out of a very old home off one of the crumbling squares of the city. Madam Iyasha fed my thirst for knowledge and she shamelessly promoted my skills as a psychic. She banked most my income in a fund to be released to me when I turned eighteen, and it turned out to be far more than I would have imagined.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had wanted to hate my mom's new interest, but he was amazing to her and good to me. Neither of them understood why I couldn't be a normal little girl, but they managed to love me anyway. They were married, in a regular church, shortly after we moved.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As I said, school sucked, until I reached high school and met Marta. Marta was as much an outcast as I was. She had moved to Savnaugh not long after me, but had been in Cothloc schools until high school. Her father, well step-father, loved her fiercely. Her mother was a raging bitch, convinced her daughter was bound for hell since she didn't suck down the Cothloc view. I had seen Marta around school our first year, but didn't really meet her until she came into Madam Iyasha's. She found it to be the same refuge I had. Asha, Madam Iyasha, took her under her wing as well. Marta devoured everything she could on vudahn. Her skills with it were similar to mine with reading. Marta bloomed in the dark recesses of the shop and soon she was the reference for even the most seasoned practitioners that came in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta and I also became each other's first lovers. I was bi, but she was strictly woman oriented. We lasted as a couple until she graduated from high school and her mom started in on her to get married and make babies. She was slowly decaying from the pressure and the constant arranged meetings with boys. She kept sane by diving into local theatre, then she got a scholarship to Davisson four years later. Her step-dad was extremely proud and fought her mom to let her go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I never could hold down a regular job. I had tried a couple of time in high school, but ended up back at Mama Iyasha's, doing readings. That's when I realized how much Asha had been holding in trust for me. She granted me access to it and arranged a new deal, where she would take ten percent as shop owner. I made enough to rent an apartment near the shop and live comfortably enough.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta and I remained close friends. She went with me to get my first tattoo, to celebrate getting out of high school. I kind of got addicted to the process and added many over the years. Marta stopped at just the one she got in solidarity with me. A year later I got my first piercing and loved it as much as the tattoos. I ended up with several, including eyebrows, lip, and nose ones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">I never could figure out how her mom could hold on to her. Marta was one of the strongest women I knew, although, she didn't seem to realize it. Vudahn seemed to be her passion, but she let it slide once she took up with the theatre people. I was proud and sad when she left for Davisson.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I expected we'd slowly drift apart after she left. Things changed faster than I expected. It was nearing the end of the year when my mom called and told me my aunt on dad's side was in the hospital. It hit me hard. I really liked my aunt and her husband,, even if they were very normal. We headed for Yew Nork as quickly as mom could get train tickets. I guess we could have flown, but the security theatre enraged both of us so much that we never did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was a tiny bit of good news to balance the bad. Marta had sent me a message saying she had dropped out of Davisson to persue her love of vudahn. She was working in a vudahn shop and studying materials her aunt had sent her. I had mixed feelings when I read that she was in a relationship with two other women. It didn't really surprise me, though. Every note she sent had glowing sections on how awesome her roommate Shan was.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* this is where <a href="sera_soulhunt.htm">Soul Hunting</a> comes in - use the attached as the preliminary story (based on story for Betsy) - Sera's experience is more brutal that the one in the story for the zine - should happen after Marta starts at the vudahn shop */</p>
