<p class="sectioncaption">Things to remember throughout</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/vashi_r.htm">Vashi</a> - CEO - Nehtanese Tzani, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/sitiri_b.htm">Sitiri</a> - Facilities - Indusan, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/magda_i.htm">Magdalena</a> - Special Projects - Ruskala, from immigrant parents, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/fairuzah.htm">Fairuzah</a> - CFO - Presaaran, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/alathea.htm">Alathea</a> - Chief of Legal - Meriksas Tzani, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/jsolitaire.htm">Jaime</a> - Chief of Security - Meriksas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Meriksas - based on United Police States of America, Ruskala - based on CCCP, Indus - based on India, Presaara - based on middle east, Eirleandra - based on Ireland</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With the inclusion of Gates, the starship idea can take second place. Determine when Rani Corp finds out about Gates and how to use them. The knowledge should come from someone that can see beyond the veil, such as <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/kalishandra.htm">Shan</a> or some of her contacts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nehtan is a predominantly matriarchal society in terms of land ownership and inheritance. Marriages can be arranged or for love. The ceremony is simple and divorce equally so.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Determine if the Taklamakan Desert (in China and near Tibet) landing area is a Crash Site or a Controlled Landing site for the Karanal refugees. This site should be the largest arrival site since Chomo is where the evacuees dug in and placed their primary facility.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Place Gates:</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><A href="../../gm_resources/info/wrldgate_navsys.htm">World Gates</a> - Only critical placements so far are the Arakov Market and Tiger's Nest. The others can move if needed.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">
1 - Yew Nork - under the first Arakov's Market, the one in the Village<br/>
2 - Tiger's Nest Monastery, Nehtan - in the original cavern where the legends for the monastery began - Vashi won't know about this gate until the concept of gates is raised with the Rani Corp.<br/>
3 - MOVE to Petra from Between the paws of the Sphinx<br/>
4 - Macchu Pichu<br/>
5 - Under the Blue Mosque<br/>
6 - Center of Ankor Wat<br/>
7* - Center of Stonehenge - originator</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* for Rani Corp company jet, one version - they have several varieties */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Consider - expand landing area near base, then add high speed train or tube train to link airport to complex</p>

<p class="regtxt12">747 calcs - 200B</p>

<p class="regtxt15">empty weight: 383000<br/>
max take-off weight: 833000<br/>
full load fuel weight: 52410 gal at 6.8 per gallon = 356388<br/>
airframe weight at full fuel load = 739388<br/>
payload at max fuel load = 93612<br/>
runway needed 10500 ft. - runway in Tzanistan needs to be longer</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>


</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">Things to consider revising</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* CONSIDER: Vashi of Tzani blood, but wasn't raised Tzani - could be half-Tzani and left with mother, half or full Tzani and orphaned, in all cases raised in connection with Nehtan royal family */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>


</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Vashi and several others buy a place, an old, run down house at the end of a bus line, away from the college campus they attend. This gets labelled the Tigress Den. To pay the bills sthey form an acrobatic troup and find paying gigs. Troup becomes known as Flying Tigers. This is before Vashi finds the entrance to the base and begins build up of Rani Corp.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">First members are <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/vashi_r.htm">Vashi</a>, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/sitiri_b.htm">Sitiri</a>, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/magda_i.htm">Magdalena</a>, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/fairuzah.htm">Fairuzah</a>, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/alathea.htm">Alathea</a>, and two others. They refurb the house and possibly find a couple more room mates. Tigress Den continues as a form of coop after the originators leave. It remains a house of mostly women, although there is no official exclusion policy, so men have been in residence from time to time. One of the other three is the Chief Legal Officer for Rani Corp. This should be another disenfranchised person of the Meriksas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Vashi is the one who sees a ring in her grandmother's jewelry and recognizes it as hers. This is the First Elder ring</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fairuzah lives with three others in Outcast House, called so because they broke from the traditions of their families, either by choice or by pressures.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider renaming the communal house Outcast House after the first place */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After the seismic project, Vashi starts having dreams while she is visiting her parents. She arranged to remain behind for two weeks to catch up before her next semester. During this time she borrowed a horse from her grandmother to go on a spirit journey, which was a trip back to the areas around Chomo and to find the entry to the base. In the basae she finds the FE ring. The necklace she got from her grandmother is the key to the base entry.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Rani Corp events and things */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">she will have to remove one or more employees because they cannot act with ethics in a system as unregulated as Rani Corp</p>

<p class="regtxt9">there are no investor or government overseers for the corp<br/>
with independent nation status, no "major power" can effectively "regulate" Rani Corp<br/>
    what protections have to be taken against the rare "unhappy ex-employee"?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">conversation between Vashi and Sarah - at her promotion into the secrets of Rani Corp</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Sarah has a negative view of humans and wonders why Vashi would want to let them off this rock<br/>
    Vashi replies - read the histories from the people who came here - they aren't any better than we are</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* dreams */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We slid into the ruins as the freak snow storm built in intensity. By the time we had a barrier errected, it was so thick you couldn't see a fully outstretched hand. Marash had the cook stove assembled in record time and water heating for hot drinks. Wind howled around the assembled shelters, rattling the fabric and seeping inn through zippers and seams.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The snow had drifted into five foot piles by the time night fell, insulting the shelters and filling in the open yard of the ruins. Sleep came swiftly, once I was warm, but it was troubled and turbulent. I was in a metal corridoar, carrying a large, heavy, leather bound book and counting hatches in the floor. Before I could figure out where I was, everything shifted and I was in rock tunnels, lit with glowing spheres, with curtained doorways on each side. A heavy gust of wind brought me awake for a momment, then I plunged into dreams of gardens surrounding an enormous multi-domed building, kind of like mosques I had seen, only with many more domes and much larger.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We huddled in the ruins for two days before the storm broke. Each night I was plagued by the random dreams, with the ones the last night being the most vivid. I was in a cave with brilliantly painted scenes on the walls, depicting the setting up of the mountain spirits as guardians of the lands around. It was a cave of legend, it's location unknowable, lost, if it had ever really existed. The alying of the spirits into a protective force occured in the oldest of stories, when the Zaani had first wandered into the valleys held by the Nehtan tribes. At the end of the long hall was a blazing sun with the black rectangle of a door opened in it. In a flash of understanding I knew that everything I had always wanted to know lay beyond that door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">THe dreams didn't fade very much, even when we moved away from the ruins and resumed the placing of the seismic sensing equipment. They settled into two main types, those in strange metal corridors and rooms and others in the cave of paintings. On the last night of the expidition came the climactic one, revealing a view back toward the painted cave from the land beyond. It stayed with me as I awoke, bth from sleep and to the realization that I knew where the view was from. My grandmother and I had walked there many years ago, hunting herbs for her medicines.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The images didn't fade through the day, like most dreams, but burned themselves into my mind so I could see them any time my thoughts drifted that way. I was doubly glad I had arranged to remain in Nehtan for a couple of weeks after the project ended, to see friends and family. the second day after the project team left, I hurried to my grandmother's place and asked to borrow her rough country truck. When she asked, I told her I was on a spirit quest. She smiled, handed me the keys, and asked that I tell her about it when I returned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Preparations weren't difficult. I had prepared for various travels all my life. I drove to the place we had been those years before, locked up the truck, and set out. The narrow valley was a couple hour walk from the last of the rough road. The view was an hour past that. It took the rest of the day to find the thin crack in the cliff that was the cave entrance. If I hadn't had the dreams, I would have never thought to look at the crack as anything more than a split where rock would someday fall from the tall cliff.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The tent was up and most of my gear stowed as the last rays of sunlight faded from the mountain. My dreams were different that night. Instead of tunnels and passages, I was in a room with several others. Charts were projected over a table. Scraps of paper were scattered across its surface and an argument was in progress. It was technical and about biological items. Most of it floated over my head, but remained coherent, rather than disjoint like dreams should be.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sunlight woke me as the rays climbed into the valley. Haste warred with caution as I broke down the tent and prepared to go. After two hours of scrambling over rock and up the slope, I stood at the crack into the mountain. Old legends and teahings from my earliest years as a Zaani flooded into my mind, driving me to make the seven pointed star of protection in the air before me before I entered the darkness. The beam of my light illuminated a wide cave, with faded paintings near the entrance. The colors intensified as I walked farther from the lighted crack I'd entered through. Each one matched the images in my dreams. The giant sun waited at the end of the cave, but there was no door. A deep grinding, sliding noise began as I neared the face and a section of it slid back, then to the side, creating the expected rectangle of black.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fear pulled the seven pointed symbol from my hands once again. I stepped beyond the door and it rumbled closed behind me. The walls came alive with a greenish glow, slowly brightening to a faintly green radiance. The tunnel was a seven sided figure, flat floor, with the other six sides folding to the wlls and ceiling. It ran straight away from the cave, deeper into the mountain. I turned, seeking the door out, and found a small green button set into the wall. It was blinking slowly. I pushed it, wanting to verify that I could leave. The passageway dimmed to darkness and then the door ground open once more. The button had started blinking red. I touched it again and the door closed, bringing the glowing light back as it did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I walked slowly down the passage, deeper into the mountain, looking for anything other than the smooth corridor. A long way in I found the first doorway on the right. It was sealed with a blank door. A little farther on was a sealed one on the left. </p>
