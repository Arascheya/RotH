<p class="pagecaption">Minghua Chapter 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A furry, warm head bumping against her cheek, together with grey light from the window, brought Minghua Kwan awake. Her eyes opened and focused on Chianghou, the stray cat she lived with. He tapped her cheek with a paw and meowed loudly. "Agh, Chiang, allright, I'll fill your bowl. Just wait a minute."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She swung her feet out of the bunk that took up the space under the window. Her apartment was cluttered with odds and ends of broken equipment, old drink containers, old, actual paper, books, dirty and clean clothes strewn about and in rough piles, and Ruomei's electric bass and amp. She shuffled through the mess to the battered cat food tin and opened it up. There was enough to partially fill the bowl. Chianghou looked up at her, then shoved his head in the bowl and started to eat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ming shuffled back to the table that served as a place to eat, work, and access the city network. She flopped down on the old foot locker that served as a chair and searched until she found and almost empty pack of jossyth sticks under a pile of old food containers. She pulled one out, settled it between her lips, and lit it. The fragrant, sweet smoke hit her lungs, relaxing her and waking her up at the same time. A sigh of pleasure drifted past her lips.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned to look out the single window, still amazed by the view of the city stretching away from her. This window, at the edge of the Gyosu Section, looked out over one of the mid-wealth areas of the city. The buildings were spaced far enough apart that light could reach between them. In the very late afternoons, sunlight would touch her bed and peek into the narrow, cluttered cave of the apartment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ruomei had given it to her when she went seeking answers to dangerous questions. Ming had refused to ask what the questions were, or where her friend was going. In return, Ruomei had presseed the keys to the semi-secret place into her hands and told ehr to take care of it and herself. The apartment was only accessible from a secret panel in Minghua's actual apartment and from the back of Orzarz Bakery.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stubbed out the jossyth stick, leaving half of it for later. She had avoided jossyth until she had been attacked four years before. Ruomei and Michelle Han had nursed her back to life after a nasty client had attempted to strangle her rather than pay for the sex he had enjoyed. Ruomei had heard the racket and come in just in time to kill her assailant. Ms. Han had treated her with various herbs and illicit drugs until the swelling in her neck had gone down enough that she could eat. Ming had started using jossyth to steady herself enough to return to her trade.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ruomei had installed the secret door in Ming's place after the attack. She had let Ming stay with her when she was too nervous to be in her own place. She had started to teach Ming how to be an e-tech so she could stop selling sex. Ming had learned enough to start repairing and selling old, broken things, and enough to use the city-net for more information. Ruomei left before Ming was able to make enough through repair, so she split her time between the sex trade and e-tech work. Most of the time Ming enjoyed the sex with no strings, until memories of the dead thug would intrude. Then she would retreat to the hidden room, smoke jossyth, and try to steady herself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Morning needs pulled her out of the chair, to the far end of the apartment where the toilet hid in its swung into the wall position. Once she finished, she pulled on a stained, worn, cotton robe and once more searched the table, This time for anything to eat. She came up empty. "Well, Chiang, looks like I have to get us food." Chianghou looked up, gave a soft mew, and sauntered toward the bunk. He stopped suddenly and spun, back arched, hair on end, and snarled at the far wall, back where the door to the secret passage to Ming's apartment and the Orzaraz Bakery was. He backed slowly under the bunk, then turned and ran through the cat passage that took him to Han's Apothecary Shop, and a way out to the rest of the section. As he did, a sharp shocking pain, like a breif electric shock, shot through Ming. She dropped to the floor, momentarily stunned by the jolt.</p>
