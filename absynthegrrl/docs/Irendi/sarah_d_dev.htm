<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">see image from Gotham for idea of how the buildings look - blue circled area</p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider this category for tales about Sarah Draybin, Jaime, and others in the poor section of town where they grew up</p>

<p class="regtxt5">think area like the one in The Crow and expand on local dynamics and politics.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Use Sarah's back-story as starting point</p>

<p class="regtxt9">update slightly</p>

<p class="regtxt12">her mom, Alice Draybin, worked for Artemis Gideon of Gideon Properties, one of the worst slum-lords</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Alice was going to turn him in, however, she contacted the wrong officers and was raped and killed instead</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Sarah witnessed part of it, including the faces of the killers</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Sarah ran, loosing herself in the area around her home until the corrupt police launched a hunt for her</p>

<p class="regtxt12">she kept running, driven furher and further by the police until she stumbled into The Hood</p>

<p class="regtxt12">terrified, because she knew what it meant, she hid in the highest part of an abandoned factory until Jaime came across her</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Jaime took her home and from there Sarah latched onto the enforcement arm of the Headmaster's organization</p>

<p class="regtxt15">she has a head for tactics and combat and a coldness that serves her well</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Sarah finds it hard to connect with people because of serious trust issues</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Sarah and Jaime became best friends</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Jaime didn't have close friends because she was the daughter of the Headmaster</p>

<p class="regtxt18">Sarah could see past that because of her circumstances</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime's mom - Rachaela Suleyzar</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Headmaster - leader of crime boss controlling The Hood</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rachaela took over from him after a foreign agent killed him</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Headmaster had overstepped and brought down the wrath of the monied elite, who sent in the agent</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hood is safe for those that live there and don't attempt to interfer with the Headmaster's plans</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hood is a perilous place for those that don't belong, be it rival gangs or other interests
presons</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Nashan - head guardian</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Rachaela Solitaire - Headmaster and Oracle</p>
