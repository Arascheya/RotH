<p class="pagecaption">Investigations</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena dragged herself up the stairs from Waverly's. It had been a long day, starting with the early morning shift and covering through the mid evening change. The thudding bass of the industrial band followed her up the stairs, but reduced drastically once she was in the apartment and had swung the door closed. Once in a while it bothered her enough to consider moving, but the rent was ridiculously low because she managed the bar for Thomas Waverly O'Malley. She dropped the container of food from Waverly's kitchen on the dining counter, stepped into her cluttered bedroom and fell backward onto the bed, staring at the ceiling, and trying to wind down from the hassles of the day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A desire for food drew her to her feet, where she stripped off her work attire of tall lace up black boots, fabric corset top, and long black peasant skirt. She slipped into a large men's button up shirt and fastened half the buttons. After a few minutes of stretching and massaging her feet, she headed for the kitchen and the counter between it and the living area where she had set her food. The daily special, in this case Indian curry, slid down easily. The latest cook was a god send, having breathed new life into the menus of Waverly's and the sister bar, O'Malley's. Grabbing her laptop, she sprawled back in the couch, loaded it up, and scanned rapidly through her email.</p>
<!--
<p class="regtxt5">Most of the emails were junk, except for two from her sister, Katya. Smiling, she opened the first one.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dear Sis,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I'm here, in Hawaii, at the Harem Club. Remember how we tried to find out about it, but couldn't find anything? How we thought it had to be a sleaze pit and you were more worried than usual about it? Well, we were completely wrong. The Harem Club is an exclusive organization within the Maharaja Resort company. It is for the insanely rich who want a private strip club and entertainment package. The facility here, just outside Hilo, is posh beyond my imaginings. I have a private suite of rooms, a maid and personal assistant, free food, a car at my call, and the right to use the corporate jet if I want to visit the other islands.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I think you''d like Lailani Kalapa, the manager here. She's smart, beautiful, and takes shit from no one. Reminds me of you in that way. Tyana and I are settling in. I'll send you more later.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Love,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Katya</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena sat back, stared at the wall a moment and searched for Maharaja Resorts. The web site was simple, tastful, and listed the cities and areas where the resorts could be found. The lowest priced rooms started at five hundred a night. Numerous sites had reviews, all indicating five star quality and service. Several sites speculated on what happened behind the private doors of the various locations.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dear Sis,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">So, we are getting settled in. The new resident package provides quite a bit of detail about the resorts, the company, and mentions it as a wholy owned subsidiary of Rani Corp. I have just started looking up Rani Corp and fucking hell, what a conglomerate they are. It loooks like they have their hand in everything we take for granted, telecom, entertainment, and high technology. Anyway, I'd send you pictures, but resort policy forbids residents from sending out that kind of data. I'd be angry, but paying residents are bound by the same rules. One of the other dancers has seen a paying resident escorted out for breaking that rule.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">We get discounts for family, if you want to come visit, room rates would be atround a hundred a night. After three months, the resort would subsidize your ticket, paying half. Seems weird to me that they can spend so lavishly on employees.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This place is crazy. There are two sections, the area for the Harem Club and then a family friendly area for other guests. Each side has the same arrangement of artificial pools, made to look like a section of river and natural pools, tropical plants, flowers, and water slides. Two of the resaurants, bars, and common areas. The screening is such that it would be very hard for someone under age to get into the club sections.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Tomorrow Lani is taking a few of us to the local shops to pick up more "island wear" whatever that is. We end up paying half the cost from our salary. Speaking of that, I have never been paid this much. It's twice what I made during that gig with the sleazy men's club chain.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Anyway, Tyana's down at the pools and I promised her I'd join her once I'd updated you.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Love,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Katya</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She wrote a quick email back to Katya, before searching for Rani Corp.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Baby Sister,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Glad we were wrong about what it was! I look forward to more descriptions of this hidden world you've penetrated.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Not much to report from here. Nyiss sends her best. Let us know if you need anything. I'll send more later. It was a long day at the bar today.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Love,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Irena</p>
-->
<p class="regtxt5">Irena was deleting the last of the junk emails when the stairs creaked under hesitant, labored steps. Irena dropped the laptop and leapt for the door, opening it just as her roommate appeared at the top of the steps. Nyissana's face was grey under her bright purple hair. The scar from her forehead and across the bridge of her nose stood out in stark relief. Her eyes were closed to slits, with moisture weeping from the right one. She leaned heavily against the wall, favoring her right leg.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena rushed to her side, helped her across the living area and into her room. She eased Nyissana carefully onto her pillows and was reaching for the migraine pills in the nightstand. Her hand grabbed the nasal inhaler when she saw Nyissana's hand twitch a certain way. She waited until Nyissana had let out her breath, then depressed the plunger as she inhaled sharply. The injector went into the trash as she closed the door and settled onto the bed next to her friend, taking her hand when she started to relax.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The touch of Nyissana's hand pulled her back from the edge of sleep. Her voice was shaky as she said, "Thanks. I forgot to refill my desk stash. Could you get me a muscle relaxer? My leg is killing me today."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Water or ouzo?" Irena asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Water, I have to go back, once I recover. Sophia has gone missing and we have some kind of big meeting tomorrow. Jim's being more secretive than usual, but he wants our demo package updated with things from the latest Conflict for Mars updates and everyone is stressed." Irena rose, grabbed a pill from the bathroom, and returned with water. "Thank you, my goddess!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena smiled and softly kissed Nyissana's scar. "You can go back, but only after you can stand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, goddess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They lay together in the dark room for a long while before Nyissana eased herself up. "I think I'm ok enough now." She stood, swayed a tiny bit, then walked, mostly steadily, to the bathroom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean Sophia's 'gone missing'? Like out sick with an extended illness?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wish. No, 'gone missing' as in not at her apartment, not with friends or family, not in the hospitals or morgue, not anywhere we can find her. She was working on ideas for a Conflict for Mars community event, but hadn't presented them yet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena sat upright. "Have you called the cops? Has anyone been to her place?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Andrew lives near her and stopped by yesterday on his way in. Her car was in her spot and her apartment looked fine from the outside. When did she last stop in at Waverly's?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Four nights ago. She seemed ok. Well, as ok as she has been since coming back from Lefronica."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wish she'd tell us what happened out there. Did you notice anything when she left? Anyone following her or showing undue attention?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, she just left, got in her car, and drove away." Irena was quiet a few moments, thinking of the friendly and out-going Sophia that had gone to Lefronica, to work in digital effects, and has returned quiet, withdrawn, and haunted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She didn't come to work Monday or email, which was strange. She's really good at letting everyone know if she won't be in. No one's called the police yet, none of us are related to her and her family doesn't seem to care."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, they haven't played a part in her life for years. They disowned her during her senior year."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know details, but it must have been weird, I can't imagine Sophia doing anything all that bad. She had just started to open up again, when we'd talk at the bar. I was hoping she'd finally say what happened in Lefronica before she came back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know. I'd like to hurt the people that damaged her. She's one of the nicest people I know. Well, I've got to get back and see if we can get the presentation package together for tomorrow." Nyissa slowly headed for the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Call me if you need anything or want me to help you home."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena waited until Nyissana was gone before she ran to her room, threw on black jeans and a loose black sweat shirt, grabbed her bag from the floor where she had dropped it, and dumped it on the pile of clothes on the bed. Rummaging through the clutter, she found the card Sophia had handed her four nights ago. On the back was a phone number and an address. She yanked open the bottom drawer of her desk and grabbed the small leather pouch with lock tools in it and dropped them into her bag. She scooped up the rest of the contents and dumped them in as well and headed for the door, stopped, dashed back to the kitchen, grabbed a couple pairs of latex gloves, then headed out. She took the tunnel from Waverly's basement to the parking ramp under CyCore Games, slid into Nyissana's little black sports car, fumbled the racing harness closed, and headed into the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty minutes later Irena pulled into Sophia's apartment complex, startled by the cheap hotel appearance of it. It was a three story U shaped building, with parking under the units and a small pool in the center of the square. A large rental office sat near the entry to the lot. Each apartment opened onto an outdoor walkway with concrete stairs to the parking area. Some tenants had flower pots attached to their railings and sitting near their doors. Sophia's area was not one of them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Before leaving the car she slipped on both sets of gloves, pulled the lock picks out of their pouch, and wrapped her left hand loosely around them. Slowly she climbed the concrete and steel steps to the third floor balcony and walked to the door marked 212. The training came back quickly and within seconds the lock clicked open.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside the cheap hotel look was magnified. A single room contained a simple bed, dresser, a grey metal desk with monitors on it, and a tiny kitchenette to the back. A microscopic bathroom occupied the back right corner. The only nice things in the place were a large ebony wardrobe against the bathroom wall, a very comfortable looking desk chair, and two new computer systems. Everything looked neat and orderly with no signs of struggle or disturbance. The black bed spread was pulled back and the sheets rumpled as if someone had gone to sleep but no clothes were scattered about. The towels in the bathroom were neatly placed on the racks and the sink and counter clean.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A large selection of gothic clothing hung in the wardrobe and a check book without a paper register sat in the desk drawer, amid numerous pens and sticky note pads. Bank statements were neatly filed in the left hand drawer, revealing a very large bank balance. Software design guides and reference manuals were arranged by subject in a cheap metal book case to the right of the desk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena sat in the desk chair and started the computers. Windows full of code and notes popped into view once the systems had loaded. The character descriptions and scenario notes she understood, the code bits meant nothing. She reached for the power switch, then stopped when she remembered Nyissa's comments. Taking data disks from one of the desk drawers, she made two copies of all the directories that looked like they might be game related. It took most of the meager stock to get all of it from both machines.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once the backups were done she turned the systems off and headed for the door. A glint from the bed caught her eye. Pulling the covers back farther she found a fist size, heart shaped sapphire sitting in the center of the bed. A strange shift of shadow prompted her to pick it up. A sound, part way between a heavy bass thump and a deep gong, so deep it was almost a vibration, echoed through the room. The lights flashed and flickered until the sound faded, leaving a strange stillness behind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><img src="../../common/item_images/hut_summon_xtal.jpg" /></p>

<p class="regtxt5">The gem rested quietly in her hand, giving off warmth and a faint heartbeat-like vibration. She stared at it for a long time before dropping it into a pocket. It seemed familiar, like an almost forgotten movie, hovering at the back of her thoughts. With a sigh, she stood, closed and locked the door, and returned to the car.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Back under the gaming studio she debated going up and giving the disks to Nyissa or waiting until she came home. In the end, she walked back to the apartment and dropped the disks on the kitchen counter. She pulled her phone out and dialed Nyissa's number. She answered on the fourth ring with, "You ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have something that might help with your work. I can bring it over."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What would that be?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sophia's notes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you get those? Who let you in?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I let myself in. There's no sign of her. The bed looked slept in, but everything else was tidy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I forgot your talent with locks. Why are you still at Waverly's instead of locksmiting?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Waverly's pays much better with the tips and I like the music and the people."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bring it over and I'll meet you at the door."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How about I bring it up instead and save your leg? I'll see you in five."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena picked up the disks and headed down the stairs from the apartment. She went all the way to the basement, back to the tunnel to the garage, then over to the door marked CyCore Game Employees Only, where she used her pass card to get through. Upstairs was another card door, then she headed up more stairs to the programing offices on the top floor. Nyissana wasn't the only person working late. A few looked up until they recognized her, then went back to work.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She found Nyissana, in her cluttered office, peering into her monitor, her skin still a bit grey in the bluish light. Nyissana slid the disks into her system, copying each one, then started to look through them. She smiled a few minutes later. "Thanks! This is exactly what we were missing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There was something else in her room. It seems familiar, but I don't know why." Irena pulled the gem out of her pocket and handed it to her friend. "I found this in the middle of Sophia's bed, sitting under the pulled back sheets. It made a deep gong, boom, reverberation, I don't know quite how to explain it, when I first touched it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa stared at the gem for a long while, then said, "Jaime's game. Remember the Summoning Gem for the magical Hut? This looks like her description, if I remember right. But how and why was this in her bed? A sapphire that large would cost a fortune. What's going on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have no idea."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What happened to Sophia?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was there anybody that didn't like her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not here. As far as I know everyone was quite happy with her and with her work. Were there any odd or creepy types paying too much attention at Waverly's?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. She'd come in, have a couple and leave. After we started talking she'd have three or four and stay longer, but I never saw anyone chatting her up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jim is going to call the police tomorrow. Maybe they can find something. You might be prepared, I'm sure they'll want to talk to us all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need to head home. I have the mid afternoon shift to cover and a bunch of monthly reports to finish up in the morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"See you sometime tomorrow, then."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Call if you need anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Dreams 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena stripped off her top and slid the jeans down. She was asleep as her head hit the pillow. Lavender edged dreams drifted through her slumber, barely memorable until a voice echoed in a large, empty space. "There is only one supreme truth of the multi-verse and that is the multi-verse exists. All the other "truths", concepts, and ideas are the wish dreams of the participants, trying to understand something that just is. Which means the "job" of the Sisters is simply to make sure the multi-verse continues to be."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How does the balance play into that?" a voice asked from the darkness to the right. The dreams shifted before the answer was heard, back into chaotic half images and impressions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena awoke groggy and fuzzy. The hot shower barely helped and the coffee just cleared her vision. She staggered down to Waverly's a little after ten and settled herself in the office. The weekly papers, reports, and forms waited in their neat piles.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="pagecaption">Police</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena was behind the bar when the police came into Waverly's. The lunch rush was just winding down when Leslie, the hostess at the door, directed the two officers to the bar. One was in uniform, the other was more casual. "Excuse me, Ms. Valinskya?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, officers?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm Detective Klein and this is Officer Hanreson. Do you have a few moments?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What can I do for you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are looking into the disappearance of a Ms. Nelson and would like to ask you a few questions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shall we talk in the office?" Irena asked. She led them through the half full dining area, through the kitchen, and into the back storage areas where her office was. It was small, with almost enough room for a large desk, two filing cabinets, and a couple of chairs. Invoices and other paperwork covered the desk. Wire trays, stacked two high, sat on each side of the desk. One was labeled Waverly's the other O'Malley's. The walls to the right and left of the desk each had a large cork board with similar labels, Waverly's to the right and O'Malley's to the left. Each one held staff schedules, notes between staff, and other items central to keeping the bars running. A large white board behind the desk held less permanent notes about coming events and band appearances.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You manage both Waverly's and O'Malley's?" Detective Klein asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I do. We expanded a couple of years ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hanreson nodded, "I remember. My compliments on the authenticity of O'Malley's. It reminds me of a place just down from my grandparents in Dublin."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you. That's what Tom O'Malley was going for."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May we get to the questions?" Detective Klein asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course," Irena replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, boss," Hanreson added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You last saw Ms. Nelson five nights ago, here at Waverly's, is that correct?" Irena nodded. "Did she seem distraught, agitated, or nervous in any way?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not at all. She had a couple of drinks, she talked about her day, then she left."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did she say about her day?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"To me, it sounded the same as always, too many deadlines and too much stress, but exciting as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was anyone taking undo interest in her? Anyone watching her that would have left right after her maybe?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. She sat at the bar, two stools over from the waitress station, if I remember right, and had three, no, two drinks, Kahlua and creams. She talked to me a bit about her day, then left."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you remember when she left?" Hanreson asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was before midnight, but I'm not certain exactly. A crowd of loud frat boys came in just before midnight and one was sitting where she had been."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you always remember what people have to drink?" Klein asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If they are friends or regular patrons, yes. Sophia was a regular and a friend, always sat at the bar, but had just started to talk a bit more over the last few months. She seemed reasonably happy, but lonely. Even so, she didn't strike up conversations with the sharks that sometimes come here. We had been good friends before she left here for almost a year. When she came back, she was a lot more quiet and wthdrawn. I was hoping she would tell me what had happened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you think someone followed her back and was either stalking or threatening her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not that I saw at the bar. If it were happening elsewhere, well, she didn't say anything about it. Is there any way you could find out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Depends,if it was happening and there was evidence in her possession, we could investigate. Would you know of anyone who had keys to her place? Did she ever mention a boyfriend or other close relationship?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. She talked a bit about dating, trying to find a boyfriend, but it sounded like she wasn't having any luck. Might I ask why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just exploring all options. Right now it looks like she just ran away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Without telling any of her friends or co-workers?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We see this a lot. Young, professional person gets in over their head, either socially or financially, then runs rather than try to sort it out. If their behavior changed, then it's even more likely."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was she in financial trouble? She always paid here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry, I can't discuss that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, right. Of course."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think that's all for now. If you think of anything out of the ordinary, please give me a call," Detective Klein said as he handed her a card. "Oh, one more thing, do you know where she lives?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Out on Kingfisher St., Happy Holiday apartments. She had me call her a cab a couple of times. I'm sorry, I don't remember the apartment number. This was a new place, after her return."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok. Her work gave us that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Should I be worried? My roommate works where she does and said I might have been the last person to see her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I don't think so. Like I said, it looks like she just ran off. Shame to abandon her stuff, but many do that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Abandon her stuff?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Looks like most of her things are still in the apartment. Odd about the computers, though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How so, if I might ask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She had two of them for starters and they were both wiped clean, the drives blanked so far they wouldn't even boot. Forensics has them and we'll see what can be recovered."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that odd?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"For a runner, yes. Most would have just left them. Wouldn't necessarily have made the bed or straightened up the bathroom either. Now I've said more than I should. It's been good talking with you, Ms. Valinskya."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have a vacation planned. Will it be alright for me to leave town?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That shouldn't be a problem. You could give me your mobile number in case I need to ask you anything else." Irena gave him the number and watched as he added it to the notes. Once he was finished, they left and Irena returned to work.</p>
<br/>
<p class="pagecaption">Jaime Arrives</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa came into Waverly's while Irena was talking to one of the bartenders. She was trailed by someone Irena thought she should know. They waved and crossed to the bar. "Irena, look who I found roaming the halls of CyCore. You remember Jaime, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, it's been too long! I didn't recognize you in that corporate garb you are wearing." Jaime was dressed in a power suit and had her hair pulled back in a severe bun. Up close, Irena could see the three studs above Jaime's right eye brow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She made a face and replied, "Yeah, it's not normal for me, but I wanted to put Jim into a spin and it worked. I am here with the Rani Corp executive team to negotiate a new game project with CyCore. The mega-corp wants to fund creating a massively multi player game based on the Realms of the Hut."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow that is extremely cool! How did it go?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a long story. Nyis was thinking I could crash in your spare apartment for a few days so we could catch up. Would that be ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, that'd be awesome. You want food, drinks? I can easily comp you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Food and drinks, but let me put it on the corp card. They won't care, especially when I tell them it's for friends. How much longer do you have?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"About another hour. Just need to make sure everything is covered for the evening."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They headed up to the apartment as soon as Irena was done. The spare apartment was at the back of the building, just down the hall from Nyis and Irena's. Jaime threw her gear in the spare apartment and swiftly changed into a loose top and sweats. She let her wavy deep brown hair was down, and it framed her elfin face. "You were going to say how it went," Irena reminded her as they headed back to Irena and Nyissana's apartment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Truthfully, it was complicated. Sorry Nyis, but your boss, Jim, is a hyper-conservative prude."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, but he treats his staff well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A prude? He came across as a bit of a horn-dog when I went to the company party last year," Irena added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He's that way in his personal life, but he won't do nudity, sexual innuendo, or much risque content in the games we do," Nyissana explained. "Jaime and the corp pitched Realms of the Hut as an adult, free to play game, fully funded by her company and Jim went ballistic. He swore up and down that he wouldn't let his company put its name on an adult title and that free to play was the kiss of death for a game, never mind evidence to the contrary."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We were hoping to negotiate a simple contract development project today and start talking details tomorrow, but it looks like it won't be that simple. Vashi and the corporate executive team will present him with three options in the morning. He can accept our proposal for contract development and make lots of money, he can refuse and we will poach his staff and bury him in legal action until he licenses the technology to us, or we can buy his company out from under him. Vashi typically goes with the buy-out option. It is more complicated since CyCore went public a few years ago and Rani Corp has always remained a private venture. We have very deep pockets, however, and many share holders just want good returns."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Vashi?" Irena asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Vashi Ristan, owner and CEO of Rani Corp."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Vashi Ristan that is Matriarch of Tzanistan? Holy shit." Irena remembered what she had found when looking up Maharaja Resorts, a division of Rani Corp, where her younger sister started working. The little information available on the privately held Rani Corp hinted that their budget was larger than many countries. It's corporate offices were located in Tzanistan, a section of Nehtan given to Vashi as her own country. Meriksan government departments had gone head to head with Rani Corp several times because Rani Corp would not allow the Meriksan government to tap communications through their network systems. Rani Corp continued to insist on warrants and then only for specific individuals, never a blanket watch. Prior to the fight, many groups had competing network access, but the ones that automatically allowed government monitoring lost all their market when Rani Corp remained firm. What had impressed her the most was the rates hadn't gone up when World Telecom and Technology, a wholly owned division of Rani Corp, became a basic monopoly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She had drifted out of the conversation, so hadn't heard anything until Jaime was saying, "...and since you both know so much about the Realms of the Hut, I would like you to form the core of the local development group."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, what? Sorry, drifted out for a minute there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You and Nyis should be the directors for the game development. You both have extensive knowledge from before. Once we have Non-Disclosure Agreements from you, I will give you the entire data package."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena froze for a moment, then replied, "I would be happy to consult, play-test, and provide creative input, but I don't know if I want to change jobs. Let me think about it over a few days. I have a trip planned for the next two weeks, which would give me time to consider. Would that be ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. Either way, if you sign the NDA, I can share the details to help you decide. Now, I think I need to sleep. I'm still getting used to a twelve hour time change."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have one with you I can sign?" Irena asked. Jaime pulled two out of her bag.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you have portable memory systems, I'll transfer the data." Nyissana pulled two out of a stack of stuff shoved into the corner of a table by the couch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena's phone rang while Jaime was transferring files. "Tom?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Irena, are you on the road or still in town?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was going to leave in the morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good! Could I come over for a few minutes? I have something I'd like to ask you before you leave."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure. Just so you know, Nyis is here with our friend Jaime."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok. See you in a bit," Tom said as there was a knock at the door. Nyissa opened it to see a smiling Tom standing outside. "Said I'd see you in a bit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come in," Nyissa said. "Jaime, this is Tom. Tom owns the bar and this building, as well as the CyCore Games building and a bunch of other stuff. Tom, Jaime is an old friend from university and is here visiting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pleased to meet you," Tom said as he came in. He was a powerful looking man, with greying hair, the start of a paunch, and lively eyes. He was carrying a small earthenware jug, a bundle of papers, and was wearing his trademark woolen coat. He lifted the jug and motioned at the table, "Glasses? This is the private reserve from my family's distillery in Eirleandra." He smiled at their looks and continued, "I've come to offer Irena a business proposal. Irena, you don't have to answer it tonight, but please think on it. I am getting older, no, don't shake your head, we all know it's true. I have no one to pass the business on to, so I propose to sell it to you. The sale and price would be arranged to minimize taxes and fees. Verne, the company accountant, has some very good strategies in mind. You would become the sole owner of the bars, the properties, my house, and everything else. I'd ask that we split the profits in half and that I am allowed to remain in my house until my demise."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena almost dropped the glasses she was getting at his statements. "Are you serious, Tom? The company has been your entire life."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course I'm serious. I'd give it to you, but the taxes on that kind of gift would kill the deal. You took my small, struggling, neighborhood tavern and turned it into a thriving business. I would have closed it down five years ago if you and Nyissa hadn't taken it on and turned it into what we have today. You have demonstrated an excellent understanding of business and I think you can make Grainne Ni Mhaille Holdings even stronger." He poured generous amounts of amber liquid into the glasses provided and lifted his, "To new opportunities!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena hesitantly lifted her glass, tapped it with Tom's. Nyissana stared for a moment, then tapped hers against the other two. Jaime hastily moved her glass in as well. They each took a careful taste. "It's an awesome offer, Tom. I would be honored to take it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know, Tzanistan has very favorable tax laws. If you transferred registry of the business to Tzanistan, you could sell to Irena for next to nothing, without penalty. The transfer is a bit convoluted for an existing company, but it is simpler if it is a privately held company. Is that the case?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"yes, it is," Tom replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could put our Chief Financial Officer and Legal Head in touch with your legal people and see if it would help you," Jaime commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would be very interested in that. I'll give you Hanna's number. She's head of legal. If Irena were blood family, it would be a bit easier, but still very costly. As for running the company, there's not much more to the task than what you do anyway, just a bit more tax and property items to keep track of. The property managers are all very competent, so it's mostly oversight and final decisions. Right now, Verne and the accounts guys keep tabs on the day to day expenses and prepare the tax reporting and pay-outs. We can do the final sign-off when you get back and after I talk to the people Jaime mentioned."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tom stayed a little longer, talking with Jaime and Nyissa while Irena drifted in and out of the conversation, still in shock from the offer. Tom got up to leave when Jaime headed off to sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">With Nyissa - Evening</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you alright?" Nyissa asked, coming up behind Irena and rubbing her shoulders.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think so. Tom's offer is just so unexpected. I know he's not as young as when we met him, but he isn't old yet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, he isn't. Maybe he wants to relax a bit more, though, and enjoy his later years. You have done wonders with the places."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena said, "I guess, anyway, I really can't take Jaime's offer now. I already have a full time thing that I love."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Were you tempted? I remember how bored you got when you tried to do that Forever City mod a couple of years ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I wasn't tempted. I was serious about wanting to test and consult, though. Oh, and the police came by today, just like you thought."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I expected they would. They were quite thorough with us. Were you ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think so. Although the detective mentioned her computers were cleaned. I didn't clean them, just copied stuff. Also, he said her bed was made. Someone else has been there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And now we can't really get in. It'll be flagged off as a crime scene until they are done with it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you think Sophia ran?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not at all. She was head of community support, happy, and loving the chance to see her additions to Conflict for Mars go live. Something happened to her. Aren't you out of here soon for your trip?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tomorrow. Should I still go?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't see why not. Nothing we can do except wonder about Sophia. I have no idea when the police seals come off a place during an investigation."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think they'll find her. This seems too weird and I can't imagine there are many clues, unless they find something like prints."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You didn't leave any, did you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I've seen enough bad crime shows to know better than that. I just wonder what the crystal means. We could ask Jaime."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure I want to until we know a bit more. I can't see her setting this up. What would it gain her?" Nyissana looked thoughtful for a moment, "Remember what else it'd do? If you expose it to light, it will try to summon again. I think we should go outside tomorrow morning, before you leave, and see what it does. Where is it, anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In my underwear drawer, wrapped in an old silk top I have."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, you are wondering too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had the silk and it seemed like a good idea last night, so yeah, I'm nervous about it." Irena had remembered silk supposedly stopped magic when she had walked back from the game company the night before. It had taken her a couple of hours to dig it out from the box in the storage locker in the basement. It was a painful reminder of the bad relationship she had gotten out of six months ago.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I never saw you as a silk person."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was that from what's his name, the really sleazoid one?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, it was his idea, along with the cuffs and chains. I sort of miss the swing, it had potential, but he was such a clumsy lover."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And a total ass-hole! I'm very glad you dumped him. Although, we could hang a swing in the spare room and use the sock on the door trick as warning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, I know. And I wish I'd listened when you told me. I don't know how I let him get under my radar and for so long. You are so bad, but I wouldn't mind trying the swing with a talented lover. Not going back to the office tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nope. We're on hold until the Rani Corp thing sorts itself out and Sophia's new ideas are in the art department for mock-ups. Could I persuade you to mix me something interesting?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. Any desires or should I surprise you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Surprise me. All I ask is not too sweet tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena returned a few minutes later with two small glasses filled with dark blue-black liquid. "This is a new one I found on-line. It's called a 'Black Ice' and is vodka and blackberry schnapps. I'm thinking of adding it to the Waverly's list."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's good. I think you should," Nyissa replied, sipping slowly. "Tonight I kind of wish you'd used the grain alcohol instead, though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">With Nyissa - Morning</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime was sipping coffee when Irena staggered out of her bedroom. "You're up early."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So are you. My meetings begin in thirty minutes. Why are you up? Isn't this your vacation?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Couldn't sleep for some reason. Too many half dreams and almost nightmares."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where you going?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Back to the old home town to visit my moms and maybe see some friends I haven't seen in a few years. I hope familiar surroundings will let me blow the dust of shitty relationships out of my head."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissana joined them as Irena finished. "When do the festivities begin?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"An hour from now. Why, want to be there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. It is the fate of where I work."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime glanced at her phone, "Have to run. Vashi's up and we need to discuss the last of our strategy before we meet with Jim. Irena, see you when you get back. Nyis, until later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena fetched the silk wrapped bundle from her dresser once Jaime had gone. They carried the wrapped crystal out on the deck. Irena carefully loosened the silk, then drew it off the top. As soon as the sunlight hit the crystal it flashed a brilliant violet and the deep sound echoed around them. Nyissa looked around nervously, expecting people to be staring, but no one seemed to have noticed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Okayyyyy. That was what I expected but didn't think would happen," Nyissa said slowly. Irena just nodded, staring intently at the crystal. "Wrap it back up, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, sure. I could stay..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should go. You've been planning this trip ever since you dumped the last ass-hat. I don't think we'll hear anything from the police for weeks and the crystal will still be as strange when you get back. I should go. I don't want to miss the excitement when Rani Corp starts negotiating."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's still ok that I take the car? I could get a rental."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok. Where would I need to go? There's food downstairs and the game company is through the tunnel. Take it and enjoy it, just don't get too many tickets."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena slid the crystal back into the silk top and then back in the drawer. She stared at her laptop. She had been going to leave it home, but the data from Jaime was too tempting. She grabbed the bag, pulled Nyissana into a long hug, and said, "You take care of yourself. Remember to refill the meds in your office and stop working if you feel bad. And use the gym more, you know you feel better when you do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, mom. You drive safe, don't speed too much, and say hi to your moms for me," Nyissa said as she walked out the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Vacation 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena was almost to the door when curiosity stopped her. She went back to her room and started up her laptop. Then she pulled the silk out of her dresser and unwrapped the gem. Within minutes she was searching through the data from Jaime, looking for the description of the summoning crystal. The data was brief, little more than she already knew, but there were links to other information.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hours passed while she followed links, read pages, scanned images, and slowly immersed herself in the designs Jaime had created over the years of gaming. Some of it she remembered from the sessions she had taken part in. Much of it was expanded details and concepts for turning the bare bones of that early campaign into a world rich enough for a massively multi player environment. Other sections contained character write-ups and creature descriptions, linked to sketches, found images, and concept art to help with development.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She looked up, startled, when she heard the door open and Nyissa and Jaime walk in, talking about something. Her computer showed it was four in the afternoon. She was just standing up when Nyissa appeared in the doorway. "I thought you would be gone already."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would have been, but I started looking at Jaime's files and couldn't stop. Guess I'd better call my moms. How did it go with your meetings?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jaime's with me. Come on out and she can tell you." Irena hobbled after Nyissa, stiff from sitting most of the day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Irena? Nyis said you'd left," Jaime said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I thought so too. So, how did it go?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rani Corp is now the proud owner of CyCore Games. At least we will be, once the buy-out of the stock holders is complete. Jim was livid, but unable to refuse the very generous offer Vashi made him. Nyis is now the game manager for Realms of the Hut. One of the senior Conflict for Mars developers will move up to manage it and anything related to the Shadow Journeys games. You will be under NDA as consultant, tester, and co-designer, meaning, you will be in the writing and producer credits with Nyissa and I. All in all, a very satisfying day. There is something I'd like to ask, since you are here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you like to take your time in Wahaii, instead of where you were headed? We could fly your moms out too, so you could still see them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What? Wait, why? How?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"CyCore will be tied up in legal for a couple of weeks, at least. I already offered to take Nyis so we could talk about game design. We could do it here, but breaking regular routines would be better. I would have offered for you originally, but you weren't going to be here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But my moms? They aren't connected to this. Why offer?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Simply, why not? More to the point, we take care of our own. There is a responsibility that goes beyond profit when you are a mega-corp. We can pick them up on the way and deliver them back when you come home. What do you say?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, I can ask them..." Irena replied slowly. "When would we leave?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As soon as everyone is ready. Probably tomorrow morning, or when your moms would be ready."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena stepped into her room and called her moms, only to find out they couldn't get away in time. "You should go, though. It would be good for you to spend time with Nyissa, somewhere other than your usual haunts."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You might think about making a play for her. I think she'd be thrilled from what I've seen when the two of you are together," her other mom added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think she likes boys better," Irena answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't be so sure. I know you find it unsettling, but we have watched the two pornos both of you were in, while at university, many times and it is obvious she was the most passionate with you. Besides, if you need cock, go make another porno. It's simpler, less disease prone, and the guys know what they are doing," her first mom added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mom!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just give it some thought. Neither of you have been having all that much success dating and you really care for each other."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena hung up after the usual round of goodbyes, then returned to the main room. "They can't get away this soon. Maybe another time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No worries. When would you like to leave? Aircraft prep will take two hours for fueling and clearances."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aircraft prep?" Irena asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. We will be taking one of the corporate planes. Ever since the Meriksas went to security theatre at the airports, it just isn't worth the bother to take commercial flights. There is another thing I can offer that will make this even simpler. I can offer dual citizenship between the Meriksas and Tzanistan. That way you can enter and leave as Tzanistan citizens and the customs and inspection process is made even simpler."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just like that? Isn't there usually some formal process?" Irena asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What can I say? We are a very informal country. There is paperwork, but mostly to satisfy the Meriksas. You can fill it out on the plane, since we aren't leaving the country. It has the added advantage that we can declare you diplomats and protect you from certain types of Meriksas harassments. Fortunately, this is rarely required."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Irena, any objections to leaving tonight? You're mostly packed and it won't take me long."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess not, sure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Travel</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two hours later the car carrying Irena, Nyissa, and Jaime entered a northern gate at Cagocha International Airport and followed an access road to a cluster of large hangers. It pulled to a stop beside a 747 with a stylized line drawing of a lotus blossom done in purple painted on the tail. "This is it. Grab your bags and lets go," Jaime said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The interior was palatial, with a large lounge area in front and private staterooms toward the tail. Jaime directed them to grab a room, drop their stuff, and join her in the upstairs lounge. Irena stopped at the door to a room, stunned by the lavish furnishings and large bed. The only visible concession to air travel was the netting in the closet to hold bags and hanging items in case of turbulence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The upper lounge contained a small bar, staffed by a pretty young woman, comfortable chairs, a large display, and menus on each seat. "We have an eight hour flight ahead, so I would recommend selecting dinner. It will be served an hour after departure. I was thinking we could go over notes for an hour or two, then grab sleep. We will arrive in Lanahua around one in the morning Wahaiian time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are the phone rules on a private plane? I should let my aunt and uncle know I'm visiting." Nyissa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My sister works at a Harem Club, somewhere on the islands. I'd like to arrange to see her, too," Irena added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Once we're in the air, no problems. There's only one Harem Club in Wahaii, on Kuawa. If she can't get away, we can go there for a day or two," Jaime answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Jaime found Irena still on her computer when she came around to rouse them for landing. "Couldn't sleep, too curious," Irena answered before Jaime could ask.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We land in twenty, so you need to find a chair and get ready. There'll be a limo to take us to our hotel. I'd recommend trying to sleep until morning local time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">The limo hustled them through the warm, tropical air to the Royal Wahaiian. Outside the windows, streetlights gave Irena her first look at Nyissa's home. The trees were different, the houses more open to the air than what she was used to where she had grown up. It pulled to a stop in front of an old fashioned building of pink stone or cement.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A porter took their bags to the elevator and guided to their room. The doors opened into an enormous suite. There was a large sitting area, wet bar to one side, enormous windows looking out toward the ocean and sliding doors to a spacious balcony. The doors were open, letting in a warm breeze, scented with flowers and sea air. A spacious bathroom opened off a hallway to the sleeping rooms. "Take your pick of the four bedrooms," Jaime said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You didn't even check in," Nyissa said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I did from the plane. This is one of three suites kept available for corporate use. I figure tomorrow we can take it easy, maybe see a few things ,then start in on the discussions the day after. Don't worry, this won't be a typical meeting. There'll be lots of time to explore. Nyissa, I know you'll want to catch a few waves."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Already called my parents and a couple of friends. I expect them to show up in the morning," Nyissa added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Katya can't get away for the next couple of days, since she's one of the new talent. She said it would be easier to go see her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We won't be working that hard. I'm sure we can make that work," Jaime said.</p>
<br/>
<p class="sectioncaption">Vacation - Lanahua</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rising sun woke Irena. After tossing and turning for a little while, she had fallen into a dreamless sleep and woke more refreshed than she had expected. She found Jaime already awake and on the phone. "Coffee's on the way up," Jaime said after hanging up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa stumbled out just as Jaime finished speaking, laptop in hand. She soon had it open and was scrolling through the surf reports. "I'd like to catch a few waves today. Looks like the surf will be perfect."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The knock at the door provided coffee. Twenty minutes later the room phone rang, announcing visitors for Nyissa. Four people were waiting when they stepped into the lobby. Nyissa hugged them all, getting lifted off her feet and spun around by the young, very tall, man. She introduced the older two as her Aunt Makani and Uncle Chuck. The other two were her best friend Maluhia Montoz, who went by MJ, and Kaikane, who went by Kai. MJ and Kai started talking surfing with Nyissa as soon as the formalities were finished.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa told them she wanted to get back into surfing shape and surf Eku before heading back to the main land. "We brought your boards, figuring you couldn't wait to get in the water," Aunt Makani added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How hard is it to learn?" asked Irena.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could have you riding waves by the end of a lesson," Kai answered. "The basics aren't hard, but refining your technique and getting ready for challenging surf takes lots of practice. If you are serious, I teach for the hotel, so you would get the guest discount."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you say, Jaime? Want to learn while these pros go and do their thing today?" Irena asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, sure," Jaime replied with a bit of hesitation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa and MJ spent most of the day riding the waves in front of the hotel. Irena took to the training well. Her strength and flexibility from gymnastics and working out helping her balance and coordination. Jaime struggled gamely, working hard to stay on her board. By the end of the day they were able to ride the smaller waves with confidence. Kai pronounced them beginning surfers, able to take on the easy waves.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They staggered back toward the hotel, tired but happy. "You too tired to eat or can we take you out?" Aunt Makani asked when the group drew near to their beach chairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We could go out, after we shower and change. Our usual Lanahua location?" Nyissa replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. It wouldn't be a proper visit without it. Kai, are you in as well?," Chuck answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would like that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* limo, since there are so many of them? The hotel would arrange it */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* figure out a favorite place and write a dinner scene in here - consider somthing like Helena's - a small, somewhat inexpensive, but very good local place */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The hotel limo dropped them back at the lobby. MJ and the Finleys walked away, after promising to call the next day for plans.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="sectioncaption">Vacation - Lanahua 2</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena was poking around at surf blogs and surf reports while waiting for Jaime and Nyissa to wake up. Room service had already delivered coffee and she was sipping a cup of excellent Kano Silver while sitting on the balcony. She clicked another link, to another surfer blog, and stared. The latest post was, "Rumors fly that Nyissa 'Scar' Zarev, has returned to surf the Women's Eku Masters competition. Sources close to this blog say she is preparing herself for the grueling waves. This blogger, for one, is ecstatic to think we will see the Scar style at Eku. Her presence in the pro surf world has been missed these last years."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What the fuck?" Irena muttered. She clicked a few more blog links and saw the rumor had spread like wild fire through the local surf blogosphere. She went back to searching and reading technique and style pages until she heard movement behind her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa slipped into the lounge chair next to her, coffee in one hand, laptop in the other. Irena spoke, "What's this mean?" She turned her laptop to face Nyissa and pointed to the blog post.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What the fuck?" Nyissa echoed. She started to say more, when there was a knock at the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime stumbled over to it, still in her robe, and opened the door to MJ, who hurried in. "Nyis, have you seen the blogs today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I just saw one. How the fuck did that get started?" Nyissa called from the balcony.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come in, grab some coffee," Jaime told MJ as she walked past. MJ made a quick detour, grabbed a cup, then kept on to the others.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Unless someone overheard us and misinterpreted what we were talking about, I don't know. You could, though, if you wanted to. You were going to get in shape for Eku anyway and it's turned into such a sausage-fest that this would be the easiest way to get a good wave. Besides, as one of the funding sponsors, I could slide you into an open wild card slot," MJ answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And take a slot away from a new hopeful? That doesn't seem right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We could do an exhibition heat, before the actual competition. You'd get good waves, and Eku would get the boost of Scar surfing again," MJ offered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh come on, I'm old news."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not from what I saw on the blogs this morning. Many locals are amped to watch you again. A lot of people miss the Scar flash," MJ said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I came here for work. I don't..." Nyissa started to say.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Work is design and can be done in the evening and when you are resting. Don't use me as an excuse," Jaime said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alright. I'll do an exhibition heat with you, but that's it. I won't take a spot from a rising star," Nyissa finally said. "I'll need to get in shape, too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Scar?" Jaime asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa grimaced as she answered, "Yeah. It's left over from when I first started school here. Local kids are especially cruel to new-comers. Ron French started it the first day of school. I managed to keep my cool about it, not reacting as he wanted. It didn't make him stop, but it kept me from falling in one myself. Once I started winning surf competions for our school, the dynamic started to shift. When I kept winning, he finally oozed up and became a friend. By high school I was one of the cool kids because I could surf anything and beat people several years ahead of me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where's the best places for you to get back in shape?" Jaime asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Either the north shore or Kuawa. Personally, I like Kuawa better. There are too many tourons and huala, but far less than here, on Ohua. I have a place on one of the better surfing beaches on Kuawa and I have plenty of extra space, although, it wouldn't be posh like this," MJ said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is there network access? We need it for working," Jaime asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of a form, yes. Not quite as fast as the average hotel, though," MJ replied. "There are a fair number of inter-island flights every day, so getting one won't be a problem."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Flights aren't a problem," Jaime added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You want to see posh, you should check out her corporate jet," Irena said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Corporate jet? Who do you work for that gives you a corporate jet?" MJ asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rani Corp," Jaime answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's why I thought your name was familiar! My mom talked about you when she was negotiating the turn over of the Turtle Bay Resort to Wihane Holdings. You're head of something, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Chief Security Officer, actually," Jaime answered. "I remember the turn over. Who's your mom?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Akela Montoz, CFO of Wihane Holdings."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She was the most knowledgeable one in the group. Do you know if she is happy with the transfer?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, they think Rani was more than fair with the deal."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When does the Masters start?" Nyissa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"End of next week. The exhibition would be the first day, around next Friday, depending on surf conditions. I should have asked, how long are you here for?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Until the Sunday after next. Irena has obigations the following Monday," Jaime replied. "No reason we couldn't fly out today, if you'd be ready for us to descend on your home."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Any time is good. I rattle around in that place, but it was the only thing I could find near the beach that wasn't really over-sized and hidious."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can have a corporate jet ready in an hour, so how long do you need to get ready to go?" Jaime asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, right, uh, two hours. I need to get my stuff from Niyssa's parents. Meet here or the airport?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's meet here in three hours. That way I can get some administrative things done. It simplifies things for security theatre if we all go in together. Oh, and here, fill these out, if you would. This will give you Tzanistan citizenship," Jaime added, handing a couple of forms to MJ. "Trust me, it simplifies the process of getting you to the corporate jet if you have a Tzanistan passport. I will need pictures for you new passports. We can shoot them on the balcony, the light looks good."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Three hours later Jaime and MJ arrived back at the suite. Irena and Nyissa were still staring at their laptops, reading various files. Jaime handed out new Tzanistan passports, "Congratulations, you are now Tzanistan citizens. I recommend you keep your Meriksan citizenship as well. It makes their border and cutoms people less pissy. If you expect to have trouble, let someone know and we will give you diplomat status and immunity." Twenty minutes later they were on the way to the airport. The plane was smaller, but the arrangements were even simpler. Jaime flashed the Tzanistan passports, her Rani Corp ID, and mentioned the flight destination. The gate guard looked at all four, then waved them through.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A Rani employee took their bags and surf boards to stow in the baggage area of the plane. Once they climbed the air stairs to the cabin, Jaime smiled and motioned for them to look around, then find seats for departure.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ten minutes later they were queued up for a take-off slot. MJ stared around the cabin of the plane, taking in the open format, comfortable seating, and small bar. "Do you always travel like this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Usually, yes. Important meetings are simpler when you arrive awake and refrehed. Since joining the mega-corp, I haven't used commercial airlines."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do you avoid having the security checks? My understanding, from many local charters, is there are certain expected levels of compliance," MJ asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It would be considered a diplomatic incident. The Tzanistan government does not allow foreign security access to our sovreign state or facilities. That is why the dual citizenship."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But Tzanistan is a small country, without standing military. The Meriksas Union is known to ignore the desires of such nations," MJ said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We have certain resources the Meriksas need and our leader is an excellent negotiator. She works hard to make sure the Meriksas never find an alternate to what they purchase from us. The joke is, they allowed us to buy the patents and copyrights on the very items we now hold over them. We use their atrocious intellectual property laws against them. They could weasel out, but it would require undoing all the laws that protect their own corporations."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="sectioncaption">Vacation - Kuawa First Day</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Forty minutes later they touched down at the Lahua airport. "If you can figure out how to get a ramp pass, I can bring my van around," MJ said as they left the plane. "There's enough room for us, our stuff, and the boards."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have some extra room? I have a portable high bandwidth network uplink that needs to come along," Jaime asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think so. If it doesn't fit, one of the rental places should have small trucks," MJ answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll have our ground crew get that worked out. One of them will meet you at the access gate. It shouldn't take long," Jaime answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just over an hour later MJ pulled the van between two large houses and up to a smaller one. "This is my palace. I apologize for the behemoths to either side. When the previous owners had to sell, these tourons bought up the land and put up the houses you see now. Some of the area around the drive is mine, but it's simpler to stay on the beach side of the house. For all they wanted beach front, they only sit on their custom balconies and sneer at the rest of us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ever considered buying them out?" Jaime asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wish! I don't have the money it would take. Shit, I wouldn't be able to afford my place with all the development and growth over the last three years. When I was a kid, I dreamed of buying this island and locking it down. Silly, I know, but it was so frustrating watching this growth happening. Most of us locals are too poor to keep land that's been in our families when the developers start in," MJ replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The inside of the house was far more open and spaciouos than the drab wall facing the road. Surf posters decorated the walls. The living, dining, and kitchen areas had been opened up into a large space. Down the hall to the left were four large rooms, three set up as bedrooms, and the fourth as an office. The bathroom was large enough to have a walk in shower and a soaking tub. Two of the bedrooms had two bunk beds each, the third was obviously MJ's room. "I put in the bunks so the Gracie team could hang here when surfing. I rattle around in here without company. Pick a place to dump your stuff. Nyissa, you can put your boards out back with mine. I'm going to check the surf report in a few minutes. How about surfing today, if conditions are good, and you can work tomorrow?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime took one of the rooms and Irena and Nyissa grabbed the other. While Irena, Nyissa, and MJ went out to check the local surf, Jaime rolled in the netwrok uplink and opened the case. A few minutes later she walked out with a small antena and tripod. She pointed it skyward and attached cabling, then went back in to check everything.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Behind the house was a small grassy area, surrounded by high bushes. A wide opening revealed the beach beyond. Native flowers bloomed in neatly tended beds. Worn lounge chairs were placed where they would have a great view of the ocean. Swells were running under a cloudless sky. The beach was well attended, with many people surfing, swimming, or walking the beach. Others sprawled on towels, soaking up the warm sun.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time Jaime joined the others, MJ was pointing at the waves and saying, "I'd recommend the newer surfers stay close in and maybe ride the whitewater. The outer surf is recommended for experienced surfers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We don't have boards," Irena said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can use any of mine, until you decide if you want your own boards. Good ones are expensive."</p>

<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Irena sat in one of the loungers with Nyissa sitting next to her, with Jaime and MJ nearby. The sun was setting over the water, painting the few clouds overhead in brilliant reds and golds. The surf pounded into the bay, running well, and reminding her of the afternoon spent trying to ride the nearer edges of it. MJ and Nyissa were pros, riding the waves with a skill and certainty of years of experience. Jaime looked a little frazzled around the edges from trying to ride even the smallest of waves. Irena was sure she had a similar look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It had been a long afternoon of surfing and Irena appreciated the cold beer in her hand. MJ rose as the reds faded into greys and the last light disappeared from the horizon. "I have some mahi-mahi I could grill up and some fruit we could chop up. Or we could order something, however, the choices aren't that varied."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Take the mahi-mahi. MJ's awesome with fish," Nyissa recommended.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Great by me," Jaime said. Irena nodded as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They followed MJ into the house where she pulled fish out and set the fruit on the counter. "Could one of you start on the fruit while I get the fish going?" Irena grabbed a knife and started slicing. Nyissa went to start coals in the small grill out back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They ate in silence, not long after. The only sounds were those of appreciation. After the dishes were cleaned up, they sat in the comfortable chairs in the open area of the house and sipped from fresh beers. "I have a question," Jaime started. "What does huala mean? I hear it from time to time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Huala is outsider in Wahaiian. It's used mostly as an insult for tourons and mainlanders."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's resentment among the Wahaiians for how the outsiders came in and took over the islands. The worst of it is they brought so much money and influence that many original Wahaiians cannot afford to live here on the wages they make servicing the tourons. It still feels wrong how the tourist places have co-opted the Wahaiian culture and watered it down into touron activities," Nyissa expanded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are Wahaiian, Nyiss?" Jaime asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sort of. I'm half, from my mother's side. Many would still consider me huala because of that, and I wasn't born here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, you are kana'aimu, which means child of the land. I know you are too respectful to say so, but the formal acceptance into womanhood my mom performed makes you a true Wahaiian. Does that help, Jaime?" MJ said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It does. There was something else you said, 'touron', what's that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa laughed as she replied, "It's a local slang word for tourist morons, although sometimes it means tourist drones for the bus people. You'll see them. Hordes of people packed into buses, with the drill being, 'Ok, everyone off the bus, this is attraction fill in the blank. You have fifteen minuts to get pictures before we have to leave again.' They are somewhat less obnoxious because they don't wander around and get into everything the way the others do. It's really funny to see them boil out of the bus, snap lots of fast pictures, then boil back into the bus."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Speaking of tourons, there've been a couple large groups of them wanting to swim the wet caves just up the road. None of them listened when my staff and I tried to tell them about the very dangerous bacteria in the water. They were  very cold, distant, and demanding in their wants, not like the average touron. The second group was even worse than the first, demanding the gear and circling my staff in ominous ways. I was really glad to see them go," MJ said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why the interest?" Nyissa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is a bit of mystery to the caves, since you have to swim in. Legends say the menehune lived in the caves, during the time of the Wahaiians. They would come out at night and build canals, fish ponds, and other useful things in exchange for bananas and fish. The tourons were asking all kinds of questions about them. Thing is, you can find pictures and a rough map of the caverns online, so I'm not sure. Elena overheard the second group talking about deeper caves, but none of the pro divers have ever found a way farther in than the three water chambers on the maps and diagrams. Martin, at the clinic, was talking about how they were babbling when they came in sick. One of them claimed they had found a hidden water filled passage deeper into the mountains that led to a dry passage covered in crawling nightmares. I think it's just the illness talking. That bacteria has almost killed a lot of people over the years. It causes fevers high enough to induce halucinations and brain damage. Martin did mention a strange little tattoo behind the ear of two of them. It was a hand, holding a sword aloft. I don't know why the sudden interest," MJ replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What would it take to safely dive those caves?" Irena asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Perfectly sealed dry suits, with a way to rinse off after coming out. If there are dry areas at the back of the caves, then enough clean water to rinse off and remove at least face gear, assuming the air would be breathable. Why?" MJ replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I get very curious about places that suddenly arouse interest. Can't say for sure why, but these tourons have me wanting to see what they are so interested in," Irena answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can order up the special suits through Gracie, but it will take several days to get them. We don't have much call for them. Are you serious about wanting to do this?" MJ said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," Irena answered immediately. She would have added more, but her phone chimed. After a brief, hushed conversation she said, "That was my sister, Katya. She was wondering we could meet her for breakfast tomorrow. That's when she'd have time to see us for more than a few minutes at a time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't see why not. Is she going to mind if MJ and I come along?" Jaime answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure she wouldn't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where does she work?" MJ asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Harem Club, near Lanahei Bay."</p>
<br/>
<p class="sectioncaption">Vacation - Kuawa - Visiting Katya</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The drive was scenic, including the area of the resort itself. When Irena asked about it, MJ replied that Rani Corp always tried for low impact in their designs and layouts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside was light, airy, and understated as well. The relaxed atmosphere extended to the dining area and the wait staff in their cut-offs and bright tops. Katya waved from a table near the pool exit. She was dressed simliar to the staff. Most of the other guests were equaly casual, however, a far table was populated by men in more formal casual dress, slacks, button shits, and dress shoes instead of flops or sandals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, that's a weird group. They can't seem to relax and they are harrassing everyone for stories of the island. Strange things like where do the menehune hide, what legends are there about strange beings, and where are the deepest, longest caves. Most of us have given up, since we know less than they seem to," Katya said as Irena and the rest sat down. Introductions were quickly made and they settled in to examine the menus.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Were there more of them?" MJ asked as she motioned toward the far table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There were. How did you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They look like the guys that came into a local surf shop demanding wet suits so they could swim the wet caves. They ignored all the warnings about very dangerous bacteria."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's what they were taling about. I overheard part of a phone argument with someone about their schedules because of illness. They never relax, and they never avail themselves of any of the resort amenities."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="sectioncaption">Vacation - Kuawa - Game Design</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next three days passed in idylic bliss, surfing when the waves were good and discussing game design and production when it wasn't. MJ walked out with a second glass of sake into the evening sun of the third day. Jaime and Nyissa were still talking about their holy grail, the ability to dynamically alter the world based on player actions, while Irena alternated her attention between her book and the conversation. They kept going back and forth about how hard it would be to automatically update all the quests necessary in a meaningful way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know what bores the fuck out of me as a gamer? Repeating the same thing over and over again. The only game I really liked was Shadow Jpurneys, and only the early parts, where each character type had different stories and quests. Once my characters reached the point where they all saw the same content, I started to get bored. Online massive games are worse with this, except Conflict for Mars. What I always wished for in Conflict was that our battles would make a difference in the world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know combat is easy to program, but Jaime's world is rich in lore and mysteries. It seems like the design is going down the easy path of combat instead of the harder path of exploration and puzzle solving. I'm not saying there shouldn't be any conflict, but the most memorable parts of Jaime's game where the times we figured out some part of the plots underneath the surface," Irena added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have a question. What if you combined the sandbox aspects of Conflict with Jaime's data? Use the settings she created as the initial conditions for the game, then let the players loose in it. Make the power players deposable or killable, although non-killable gives them the chance to come back at the new power brokers," MJ asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But how would we do that? AI isn't good enough for that kind of character complexity," Nyissa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have employees, right? Have some of them play the starting power brokers. It gives a real feel to them and allows you, as game developers, to fight back. Make sure there are ways for players who hate combat to do other things in game. Spies have been very useful throughout history and merchants are essential for basic needs. Game economies always stall on how to liberate cash from characters. If they have to interact with a living economy, most of those problems go away. If you want to try something novel, try for a mix of Conflict for Mars, Online Life, and this new game. Make it more about the worlds and players than about missions, quests, and body counts. You won't get the hard-core traditional players, but you have a good chance of getting those like me, those that want something out of the ordinary," MJ suggested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't think you were a designer," Jaime said to MJ.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not, but when Nyissa went off to be a designer, I wanted to understand what she was doing. I bought everything her studio produced. Then I read a lot. The theory behind the design caught my interest, so I kept reading everything I could find."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This approach would solve most of my complaints. What I hate about theme park massive games are PvP, forced grouping, repeating the exact same missions over and over again, and constant combat. I would love a game where those weren't requirements to play and where the world actually evolved based on player actions," Irena commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This could work. How about we think about it for a day and revisit? MJ, if you sign an NDA, I can let you see the background data," Jaime said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like that. There's quite a difference between reading other people's thoughts and being involved in a real project," MJ said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="sectioncaption">Vacation - Cave Diving</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MJ had a friend drop them at the parking lot for the wet caves, with a promise to return when called to pick them up. They had suited up most of the way at MJ's before heading out. All that remained was to pull on their tanks and seal up the face shields.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The water was almost cold as they slid into it. Irena took the lead because she was the most interested one. The first chamber was small, with a narrow passage to the next, larger cave. As if by signal they switched on their lights at the same time, playing them over the rough walls and across the crystal clear water. There was no passage above water. Irena found it after diving at the right side of the back area.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nervousness began to build the deeper she swam into the submerged passage. There was a warm pulse from the sapphire she had tucked in between her breasts. She hadn't been going to take it, but had run back at the last minute and grabbed it. A wave like pulse spread from the end of the passage into the next cave. There were three more warm bursts from the gem and the nervousness faded from her mind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They swam through several more chambers and passages until they reached a deep cave with a low ceiling and a smooth ledge at the back. The water passages stopped, but there was a smooth lava tube driving deeper into the mountain. MJ motioned for Nyissa to help her rinse her mask, then she eased it off and sniffed at the air. After a few minutes she signaled the all clear and helped everyone else rinse off enough to pull away their masks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The air was chill and damp, with a hint of a strange perfume. The tube went back a few yards, began to ascend, and turned left. Irena took lead again, moving steadily up the tube. After several more twists a faint light was visible from ahead of them. It was reddish, with a hint of rainbow or color changing lights behind it. Irena began to hurry up the last of the incline, rounded the last bend, and stopped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The tunnel ended in a medium sized chamber of smooth rock, like a bubble trapped in stone. Centered in the chamber was a red bubble of energy.  Directly between the entrance and the bubble was a short granite pillar with a black alabaster statue standing on it. The figurine was of a woman with unfurled bat wings and arms stretched out from her sides. Her hands pointed toward similar figurines on each side of her. Seven figurines were arranged in a ring around the pulsing bubble. Each column was placed in the center of a seven pointed star, formed of odd shaped runes inlaid in hematite. The red energy bubble was anchored to the hands of the figurines and from the tops of their heads to points of a seven pointed star inlaid in carnelian above the pulsing globe. Inside the red bubble was a pulsing swirling ball of multi-colored light. "Holy shit!" Irena swore.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jaime, that's just like your description of a sealed gate," Nyissa added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's going on?" MJ asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This changes everything," Jaime mumbled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa explained about Jaime's pen and paper role playing game and how the thing in the cave was exactly what Jaime had described for a gate between worlds. No one had any ideas on the next question, which was how it could exist and be in the cave with them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do we open the seal?" Irena asked, walking closer to the red bubble. As she came closer the red waivered and faded, allowing her to approach the inner bubble. "Jaime, if I step into this, where will I end up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How would I know? In the game realm it would be the Gate Dimension or a place, based on how the gate is set."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's check it out," Irena said, stepping closer to the bubble. "Come on, what's the worst that can happen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe you shouldn't ask that," MJ said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stay or come, either way, I'm going through," Irena stated as she stepped into the inner bubble.Nyissa followed quickly, with MJ and Jaime responding with more reluctance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They found themselves in a spherical stone chamber. Stained glass windows, worked in images of phantasmal creatures let in shafts of mutli-colored light. A single solid oak door was the only exit. Irena led the way outside.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Age blackened and lichen slicked mausoleums clung to the walls of the narrow gorge. Ancient trees overhung them with drooping branches. Leaf filtered midday sun cast pools of light and shadow on the leaf cushioned ground. A small stream rushed down the center of the gorge, while a narrow path clung to slope of it. Birds called in the trees and the distant sounds of hunting cats drifted on the faint breeze. The air was purfumed with heavy spicy floral scents.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Home Zero?" Jaime, Nyissa, and Irena said at once.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is home zero?" MJ asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The home base of a major artifact in the Realms of the Hut game Jaime designed," Irena answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There should be a large clearing down the path, with the rock promontory beyond, where the hut would be. If this really is home zero, we should be able to see traces of the Discord from the clearing," Nyissa said. She led the way down the path. It twisted its way along the edge of the rushing stream. Fingers of rock walls and buildings could be seen through some of the trees, clinging to the steep walls bordering the ravine through which the stream ran. At last it passed through a large crumbling gate of lichen and moss covered granite and into a large clearing where the valley widened out. Ahead, it continued up a rocky outcropping in the center of the valley, overlooking the large lake that filled the end of the valley</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime stared up at the sky, searching it from one edge of the clearing to the other, then shielded her eyes from the sun and stared straight up, "Look at the sun position. Either it is just now noon, or were are at home zero, in the Discord."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa stared up as well, "I think you are right. Irena?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's the Discord?" MJ asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Sphere of Concordant Discord is a place of pocket realms, located in a Dysan Sphere, at the very center of the multi-verse. If we really are there, then Sphere, the city at the center of everything, is inside another sphere, forming the 'sun' we see overhead," Irena answered. "I think this is the Discord. See how the light is fading, but the source hasn't moved? How can this be?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know," Jaime answered slowly. "I need to tell you what Rani Corp is doing. There was an alterior motive in creating the Realms of the Hut game. What I am about to tell you is completely covered by the NDAs you signed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime settled down on the grass, waiting until the others had followed suit. "This might sound a little less weird, now that we have seen this place. Rani Corp was founded by a single person, who happened to find 'alien' tech, for lack of a better term. This tech arrived in ships evacuating a distant world and arrived around 300 BCE. The purpose of the Realms of the Hut game was to quietly recruit open minded people to work on returning to the evacuated world. The fact that we found a gate to here changes everything about that plan. Originally Rani Corp was setting up to hunt for a starship, believed to be parked in the asteroid belt. There were many complications around this idea, not least of which is how do you repair technology you have never seen before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There are some vague references to something like the gate on the evacuated world. If we can find a way through the gates, we could skip the starship buildup and go straight to an exploratory return. Of course, if the gates are similar to how I imagined them, then navigating the gate system isn't very easy either. For example, I have no idea why that gate brought us here. Maybe it was the gem Irena is carrying, or maybe it was something else."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you think the gate is what the tourons were looking for?" MJ asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, but how would they know of it and that it was there? MJ, could you ask your people if they remember anything else from the suspicious groups?" Jaime replied. "Irena, it would take a magic item, some kind of Gate Key, or, shit, how would I know? I just made them up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good question, I will check and see in the morning, or whenever we get back," MJ replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa had been looking around the chamber, fascinated by the gate. She spotted a second tube leading away from the chamber as she turned to head back to her friends. "Shall we see where this goes while we are here?" Nyissa asked as she pointed to the other black opening. They all looked at each other and headed toward it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The tube ascended, twisting and turning, for quite a way. Irena felt her nerves winding up again as she led the way. The tube turned to the left and passed through another bubble in the rock. As Irena stepped into the bubble, there was another warm pulse from the sapphire and her nerves quieted right down. This one had odd carvings on the walls and fetishes scattered around it. A little bit further and it widened to the left and shrunk down to a plug of rock directly ahead. Nyissa stepped to the left and disappeared from view. A second later she returned. "That's strange, there's moonlight just past this wall of darkness."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MJ stepped out next, returned and said, "I think we're above the Lumahili Gardens, but I don't understand the rest of this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Illusary wall to conceal the Gate," Jaime answered. "At least, that's what I'd do. Then there would be some type of secondary protection in case someone got through the illusion."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irean pulled the gem from beneath her suit and held it up. "I think there were secondary defenses. This pulsed a few times on the way in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime stared at the gem for a long time before saying, "May I see that?" She took it in a trembling hand and stared at it. "This looks like a Hut Summoning Gem. Why would it influence gate defenses? Did you try the light test on it? Did it call?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We did and it did," Nyissa replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you find where we are from the outside, in the daylight?" Nyissa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe. I used to volunteer at the preserve," MJ answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was four in the morning when she remembered to look at the clock. She was going to shut the machine down when another heading caught her eye. Suddenly she was immersed in the politics and power struggles of the campaign. The tabletop game had only scratched the surface, even after three years of playing once a week. Page after page detailed factions, power brokers, minions, and themes. The deeper she went the broader the scope became, until the final conflicts were being waged on a multi-versal scale, crossing times, parallel worlds, and the planes of existence as defined in many of the various gaming source books on the market.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena looked at the clock again and it said eight in the morning. She shook her head, stood unsteadily, and reserved the room for another night. She called her mom and gave a flimsy excuse for a late start, promising to be to their place the next day. She had been planning to sleep, but tossed fitfully for a long while before turning the computer back on and continuing her research.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stomach cramps pulled her away at noon, forcing her to consider the food she had skipped the night before as well as in the morning. Her hands flew to the keyboard first, then with a raw chuckle, she grabbed the handful of fliers the hotel had left in the room. She ordered from the first one that had delivery service.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Irena - Vacation 2</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cheap, greasy pizza in hand, she returned once again to the screen. Twenty-four hours after she had first started reading, she leaned back and stared out at the tiny room. Unexpected tears dripped down her cheeks at the realization that the game was all just a fantasy. The world trapped in her computer was vibrant and alive with possibilities, dangers, and conflicts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She pushed the laptop to the other side of the bed, slid down, and stared at the ceiling until sleep slowly claimed her. Random images from the things she had read drifted through her dreams. Sophia's sapphire was always there, hidden, calling to her to find it and touch it. Every time she did, the air would start to shimmer and her dream would change to a new place. She tossed and turned fitfully, waking up in the early morning light, tangled in the bedding, almost unable to move.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Irena - Moms</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The hotel shower was almost too weak to pound the kinks out of her muscles, but it did enough for her to painfully climb back into Nyissana's sports car and continue the drive. She pulled into her mom's driveway just as the sun was setting.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her mom swept her into a hug while her other mom said, "Nice car, when did you get it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I borrowed it from Nyissana. We only have one car now," she replied as she swept her other mom into a big hug. "It's so good to see the two of you!" She grabbed her laptop and bag and followed them into the house.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We cleared out your room. Drop your stuff and come back down. Do you want to eat in or go out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Eat here. I'm road burned and tired. Sorry for the delay but our friend Jaime dropped by just before I left. She gave me her notes on the fantasy game Nyis and I used to play. I got sucked into it when I started looking at it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No problem, we didn't worry after you called."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena hauled herself upstairs, dropped her stuff, changed into loose things, and went back down. Her moms were sitting around the small table in the large kitchen, wine glasses in hand. A third one was filled with her favorite Bull's Blood red. "To family," Irena said as she touched glasses with the other two.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During the simple meal Irena told them about her recent relationship woes. Her birth mom said, "You have a beautiful roommate who thinks the world of you. Have you thought of hooking up with her? When you want a man, you could shoot another porno. The two you did at university are still the hottest ones we've seen. I know, that kind of creeps you out, but it is true."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have made peace with the fact the two of you really like what Nyis and I did. I'm still surprised she agreed to it. She is quite body shy because of her scars. About your suggestion, I'm not sure it would work. I think Nyis is more interested in men than women."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think so, dear," said her other mom. "I've seen how she interacts with you when you both visit. I suspect she would surprise you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can talk more on this again. Do you have any other plans while you're here, or are you just going to clutter up our house?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hadn't given it much thought. Once in a while I wonder what Stacy is doing, but after her reaction to the Girls of Goth spread, I haven't really talked to her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Some people are just too wound up about nudity. Although, Stacy just seems wound up. She's still on the hunt for a man from what I've heard."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She was desperate to breed," Irena added. "I suppose its only gotten worse as she's aged."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It would really help if she stopped dressing like she was still in high school. I've seen her haunting Brochan's the few times we've gone for drinks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should visit us in Cagocha more often. I can show you a real Irish pub."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Irena - Old Friends</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The hotel shower was almost too weak to pound the kinks from her muscles, but it did enough for her to painfully climb into the sports car and resume her drive. She pulled into the driveway for the Jonasson house just as the sun was setting. Stacy met her at the door to the home, her eyes tracking back to the black sports car parked in the driveway, "Nice car. When did you get that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I borrowed it from my roommate. It was too much pain in the ass to keep two cars, so now we share."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hope you brought something sexy to wear. We're meeting Amy and Tricia at Brochan's for drinks and dancing." Stacy was bubbling enough to not notice Irena's smile was forced and her eyes didn't light up like they should have at the prospect. "Come on, hurry up and change. They're probably waiting already!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Traffic sucked. Sorry I'm running late," Irena apologized.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stacy hauled her into a tight hug, "That's ok. Brochan's will work its magic and you'll soon forget about that ass hole ex of yours and any sucky things that have happened at work. Oh, yeah, a bit of fucked up news. My ass wipe brother is down for the weekend and parked on the parent's couch, so we have to share my room until next Monday." Stacy led the way to her room and motioned for Irena to drop her bag near the door. Irena followed, stopping to take a deep breath before following her in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok, I guess. What about the guest room? He has a bit more of that man smell than I like."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it's already in use by some high-powered politico my dad knows. This weekend is some sort of fund-raiser or something. They have a bunch of people coming in from elsewhere in the state for parities and meet-and-greets. They'll all be gone at the end of the weekend and then you can have the guest room," Stacy said, making a small face, "Man smell? You're not turning into a lesbian are you? I love your roomy to death, but she's a bit of an odd one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, just your brother has more of that man smell than I like. Beside, Nyissa's never put the moves on me, ever. And she's bi, just ask her last boyfriend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bi? I still don't get that. Can't she make up her mind?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stace, I've told you, it doesn't work that way. She likes people, not genders."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, ok Rena, whatever you say. Now go, get dressed," Stacy gave her a swat as she left the bedroom, pulling the door closed behind her. The room hadn't changed since Irena had last visited, two years before. Dolls and stuffed animals still crowded the shelf over the bed. Boy band posters clung to the walls, pink lacy curtains framed the large window and the thick pink quilt was perfectly smoothed over the pink clad large bed. Scents of lavender, vanilla, and lilac collided in the air, making it almost too thick to breathe. Irena struggled to hold back her coughing, knowing once she got started, it would be almost impossible to stop. She stripped out of her travel clothes and slid into a long black velveteen skirt, tight, laced up, blood red corset top, and six buckle boots, something that would have been tame by Waverly's standards. Stacy looked her up and down when she emerged, almost frowning in disapproval for a split second, before pasting on a cheerful smile. "Still into that dark stuff, I see."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yup," Irena answered, not wanting to get into the old discussion again. "Guess we should get going."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Irena - Brochan's</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Brochan's was the local version of what everyone thought an Irish pub would look like. It was located in a shopping complex across the street from the local mall. Inside, the walls were covered in distressed plaster but the tables were the generic ones found in every chain restaurant across the country. The floor was carpeted to reduce noise, except for a small dance area near the juke box. The servers were dressed in clothing that looked more gypsy than Irish and the food choices were the generic types found everywhere. Before Irena had moved to the city and started working with Thomas O'Malley, it had seemed exotic, now it just seemed trite.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Every table was filled when they walked in. Fortunately, Amy and Tricia had already arrived and grabbed one. Seeing her friends in the same styles they had worn in high school, going to clubs with the same kinds of music, forcefully reminded her how much she had drifted out of their circle. As soon as they were seated a waiter came over for their orders. "Slivovitz, please," Irena added to Stacy's order of Irish Cream. She tried again when the waiter shook his head, "Jameson Limited Reserve?" He shook his head again. "Jameson Gold?" He nodded at that one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Still drinking weird stuff?" Amy asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's nothing odd about slivovitz, and what's an Irish bar without a selection of Jameson's at the very least?" Irena replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, big city girl," Tricia added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first drink relaxed her enough that the thoughts she had pushed away while driving returned. Stacy and the others started comparing the guys in the pub while Irena's mind wandered, painting a picture of a very different place. Dark stone walls arched over a rough hewn floor. Smoke hung heavy in the air, thick with the scents of grilled meats, tobacco and other smokes, sweat from many different races of creature clogged the air. Booming echoes of conversations, shouts of greeting, food and drink orders, and music, from a stage in a small pocket cave partway up the far wall, crashed around her in a deafening tide. Shadows flickered from lamps and torches hanging from the ceiling, placed on tables, or jutting out from the walls. She was seated at a small table, tucked into a little alcove against one wall. A single candle guttered in the air currents, flickering light and shadow across the top of the dark black liquid she was drinking. Across from her a small urchin girl sat, sipping a bile green colored sludge and smiling with genuine delight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Earth to Irena. Hello, where were you? I've pointed out the same guy four times now and you haven't even twitched your eyes," Stacy hissed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, um, nothing, just more tired than I thought from the drive," Irena responded slowly. She forced her eyes to focus where Stacy was pointing. None of the guys in that general direction caught her eye.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That one. The one in the denim jacket," Stacy almost huffed. Irena looked at the man in question. He was the blandest looking one of the bunch, although he was handsome enough. He could have been a final year student, a law clerk, or an insurance man. "Maybe you are becoming a lesbian," Stacy said with an edge when Irena just looked away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sorry Stace, he just looks boring. I don't see anything edgy about him at all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn it, what's wrong with you? That ass hole you dumped sure was edgy enough. Abusive, drunk, and rude. Is that what you want again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, but I want someone with some fire, some passion, and who isn't afraid to be different."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that some type of comment on me?" Stacy asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. No, of course not," Irena responded, almost too quickly. That actually was what she was thinking. When she had planned the trip home, she'd thought it would help to see her old friends, go to the old haunts, and drool over the boys again. But it all felt empty and hollow. She began to regret having taken two weeks, then told herself if she still felt the same way tomorrow, she'd head back early.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At least get out there and dance," Stacy pressed. Reluctantly Irena hauled herself up and edged through the crowd to the dance floor. Not very many people were dancing, so she stood out both in her darker attire and because she was dancing alone. Several guys tried to join her, but moved away when she ignored them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You didn't even try to dance with any of those guys," Stacy accused when Irena returned to the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not interested," Irena replied. Stacy pointedly turned away from Irena and only talked to Amy and Tricia for the rest of the evening. After five or ten minutes of the silent treatment, Irena rose and spent the rest of the night alternating between the bar and the dance floor. It wasn't the music she particularly liked to dance to, but it was easier than being near Stacy while she pouted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The ride home was spent in strained silence. "We have to share my bed, but don't talk to me until morning," Stacy said when they entered her room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cloying perfume, scented powder, and overpowering lavender scents clashed in Irena's throat and lungs, forcing a short bout of violent coughing. Stacy just glowered until she was finished, silently handed her a box of tissue, and stomped off to the bathroom. She returned a few minutes later in her perfect pink nighty, flopped down on the bed, rolled to the far side, and stretched out facing away from Irena and the room. Irena stared at Stacy for a long time before pulling a pair of sweats out of her bag, changing into them, and slipping into bed. She stared up at the ceiling for a very long time until sleep finally pulled her down into more strange dreams.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Irena - Shopping with Stacy</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stacy spoke to Irena in the morning, however, she was still distant and formal. She thawed slightly as the day progressed and a bit more when they met up with Amy to go shopping. Once again it proved how much Irena had changed and what her expectations had grown to be. Even the chain psuedo-goth shops weren't available in the local mall.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While Stacy and Amy sorted through clothes, scurried back and forth to the fitting rooms, and chattered on excitedly about the men they'd seen at Brochan's, Irena let her mind wander. She was in a roofed over street market. The murmur and crest of numerous conversations swirled around her. The air was heavy with spices, scented smoke, perfumes, and sweat. Women walked boldly in the bustle, often followed by men carrying bundles and bags. Here and there friends met and chatted at small tables near food and drink vendors. The clothing was a riot of vibrant colors and rich fabrics. Hot yellow sunlight smote the streets beyond the market. Jugglers and musicians performed for copper coins in open spaces in the bustling crowd.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Irena. Irena! Hey, what do you think of this?" Stacy almost shouted in her ear. Irena snapped back into the tawdry mall shop to find her friend standing in front of her in another hideous outfit. It was pink, with little embroidered unicorns, made of saggy knit fabric and might have looked good on an eight year old. Irena couldn't choke back all of the laugh that rose unbidden at the sight. "Hey! I think it looks great on me," Stacy snapped back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure it does. I'm fashion impaired, remember?" Irena replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, yeah you are," Amy added with real venom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When they headed into the next shop, Irena pulled her cell phone and dialed. "Alex, could you call me back in half an hour?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure boss, what's up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This vacation was a bad idea. I need to leave, but I want to give my friends an excuse, something like a disaster at work."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure thing. Not enjoying the old haunts?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Realizing there are some places it's better not to go back to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hear you there! Got to go, we're getting busy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rather than follow her friends into the shop, she continued down the walk until she found a book store. She was wondering the aisles, finding a few interesting titles, when Stacey stormed up to her. "You trying to ditch us or something? Too good for your friends now? What happened to you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena started to answer when her phone rang. She made a show of looking down and checking the number, "Sorry, I have to answer this. Yes?" She listened for a few minutes then ended the call with, "I'll be back as soon as I can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who was that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My assistant manager. Someone disappeared after leaving Waverly's and they want to question everyone that was on duty that night. I'm going to have to head back right away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Disappeared? Why do you work there? Why do you live in that city? It's a dangerous, nasty place!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Because I like it, Stace."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think I know you anymore. You used to be sensible and interesting. Ever since you started hanging out with that weird Esther character in high school and then those gaming geeks in college, you've just gotten weird. I thought you wanted to see us but I guess I was wrong."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The ride back to Stacey's was spent in silence. Their goodbyes were pleasant but distant as Irena climbed into her car and drove away. She kept going until she reached the motel she had stayed in on the way out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Irena - Dreams</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once more Irena sat on a hotel bed, enthralled by the laptop in front of her. She scanned indices and tables until she found the entries she was looking for. The first detailed a bar in the depths of Sphere, City of Doors, Eternal City at the center of the multi-verse. The description and sketches of the Neutral Zone matched her imaginings at Brochan's perfectly. Down to the small table in the alcove and the urchin seated there. The second description was of a public market in the heart of Jakara, Gem of the Lotus, capital city of the Lotus Empire.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She sipped slivovitz from the bottle she had bought, nibbled on greasy pizza, and wandered the descriptions and renderings of the game world for a couple of hours. She turned the laptop off and slid under the covers, falling rapidly into a deep sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her dreams were random and unmemorable until a strange purple flash occurred in one. The heart shaped sapphire of Sophia's rested in her hand, pulsing and glowing with a deep purple light. She lifted her eyes from her hand to the table in front of her. Knives, swords, pouches of grease, and sharpening stones were laid out where possible customers could examine them. Overhead dark grey clouds shifted and swirled above the market area. Lightning flashed and thunder crashed in the distance. Cloths and tarps had been hastily strung up on poles to protect wares and the people close enough to browse them. Canals were visible behind the merchants not backed up against tall wooden buildings. Her table was set back in a narrow space between two buildings, their balconies and bridges providing shelter from the drizzling rain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Balconies, bridges, and narrow walkways snaked between the tall buildings and arched across the canals in front of her. The throng of people gave little attention to the storm, instead focusing on haggling for food and goods as if it were a normal day. Few found their way to her small table, which was just fine. The flow of faces and styles in front of her was more interesting than the thought of having to sell anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A bright purple flash of light blinded Irena and, when it cleared, she found herself looking out into a forest glade. In the center of it a hexagonal wooden hut crouched. Smoke curled from the chimney and a white fence surrounded a stretch of emerald green grass and beautiful flower arrangements. Behind her the forest brooded, dark and forbidding. Animal cries echoed in the distance. Overhead the sky was deep, crystalline blue with tiny puffs of white cloud.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena began walking toward the hut. As she neared the fence it resolved into bones, woven together to form a fence. Grinning skulls rested atop the fence posts and seemed to watch her with dim, orange fire eyes. The gate swung open as she approached, while a voice softly whispered, "Welcome home, Mistress."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A loud honking and banging slammed her awake, abruptly ending the spell. Her head pounded with the suddenness of the intrusion. The cheap hotel clock showed five in the morning and the sky was just showing the beginning of day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Irena - Home Again</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She struggled to a sitting position, finding the heart shaped sapphire resting warm and heavy in her hand. She stared at it, remembering having left it wrapped in silk, back at the apartment. A dim flicking flame still danced in its depths, hypnotic and slightly frightening. She turned it, accidentally shifting it through the sunlight from the mostly drawn drapes. Once again the air shimmered with a deep gong sound. The flame flashed to brilliance and in the after image, burned across her eyes, she saw a shadowy scene of a woman in a throne. A second woman stood in front of her. Then the flash faded and she was staring at cheap hotel walls once again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena rose on unsteady legs, packed her bag, and left. On the highway she floored it, staying at the head of traffic instead of with it, slowing only where she thought there might be traffic officers. Her instincts were perfect, slowing her every time before a radar car came into sight. Her thoughts were too frantic already to notice the strange coincidence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She pulled into the drive an hour and a half sooner than her previous best time, dashed upstairs and shouted for Nyissa. "Hey, I thought you were gone for two weeks," Nyissa's voice called from her room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was going to be, but it was too weird being back there. Remember those friends I mentioned? They're still exactly where they were when I left. I don't know what I wanted, but I should have taken your advice and gone somewhere different." Irena detailed her few days, then asked, " Has there been any word on Sophia?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. The police are still nosing around, although their enthusiasm seems reduced. Jaime's still here. Rani Corp bought us out and Jim is gone. Jaime's still in the offices, getting things started and managing the transition. She sent most of us home while she resets security in case Jim has second thoughts. Tom's got a new key card for you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How are you doing? Did you go on that date you had set up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, it sucked almost as bad as your trip sounds. He took me to a fancy place, then sat me in the darkest section, with my face turned away from the rest of the people. He wouldn't make eye contact, and when he did look at me, it was to stare at my scar. He made all the moves of trying to take me home. I think he expected me to jump into bed with him because he was the only option I'd have. I'm tired of it. I'm done, at least for now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stacy accused me of being a lesbian. like it was a bad thing, and the shit-sacks she pointed out would make me want to gnaw my arm off by morning. Screw her and screw her expectations. She's been critical ever since we did the Girls of Goth photo shoot at university. How about we officially hook up for a while and quit this crazy dating thing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Best offer I've had in forever, and it doesn't hurt that you're the best lover I've had."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena gave her a devilish smile, "And we can try out that swing." Nyissa smiled back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena was thinking about grabbing Nyiss and heading for her room when her phone rang. The ID showed Thomas O'Malley. "I need to take this." She accepted the call and said, "Tom, is everything ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, lass, I'msorry.I forgot you were on vacation. I'll call when you get back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a second Tom. I'm back, came back early. Things were, well, it wasn't what I needed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could I come over tonight? There's something I'd like to discuss with you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just a sec, Nyiss has had a few bad days. Let me see if she's ok with this." She muted her phone and said, "Tom would like to come over. Would that be ok?" Nyissana nodded and Irena let Tom know.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Great, I wouldn't mind seeing Nyissana again. It's been too long."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He'll be here in a few minutes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Moments later there was a knock at the door. Tom came in carrying a small earthenware jug, a bundle of papers, and his trademark woolen coat. "Evening, Irena, Nyissana," he lifted the jug and motioned at the table, "Glasses? This is the private reserve from my family's distillery in Eirleandra." He smiled at their looks and continued, "I've come to offer a business proposal. Irena, you don't have to answer it tonight, but please think on it. I am getting older, no, don't shake your head, we all know it's true. I have no one to pass the business on to, so I propose to sell it to you. Sale price would be one hundred dollars and you would become complete owner of the bars, the properties, my house, and everything else. I'd ask that we split the profits in half and that I am allowed to remain in my house until my demise."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena almost dropped the glasses she was getting at his statements. "Are you serious, Tom? I can't take it for so little."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course you can. I'd give it to you, but the taxes on that kind of gift would kill the deal. You took my small, struggling, neighborhood tavern and turned it into a thriving business. I would have closed it down ten years ago if you and Nyissa hadn't taken it on and turned it into what we have today. It should be yours as reward for that." He poured generous amounts of amber liquid into the glasses provided and lifted his, "To new opportunities!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena hesitantly lifted her glass, tapped it with Tom's. Nyissana stared for a moment, then tapped hers against the other two. They each took a careful taste. "It's an awesome offer, Tom. I would be honored to take it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's not much more to the task than what you do anyway, just a bit more tax and property items to settle up at the end of the year and Vern is one of the best tax guys around. We can sign these tomorrow. You can have Hanna go through them with you. You'll be seeing more of her, now that you'll be making the legal decisions instead of me."</p>

</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rani Corp? Who're they?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jaime's backers. It's their money funding this venture and we promised a live demonstration server running by next week so they could take a look at the final concepts."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not a game developer, but I do know Jaime's characters pretty well. Reading through her notes, while I was gone, brought them all back to mind. If there's any way I could help, I'd be happy to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, maybe. It's not just knowing the characters. You need to set them up, but that is done in an editing environment, so you wouldn't have to code them directly," Nyissa said, more to herself than to Irena. "It might just work. Come in with me tomorrow and I'll run it by the director. You still have the rest of your time off, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I did take three weeks for a break, yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then come in tomorrow morning with me and see. I think you can help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, sure, I can do that," Irena replied, nervous, now that her offer was accepted. She opened her laptop and began looking through the game docs as soon as she had finished unpacking. Looking through the files reminded her of the incident of the morning. "Hey Shan, did anything strange happen this morning?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know that sapphire we found? It appeared in my hand this morning. I was certain I had left it here when I left."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I saw you put it in your drawer. You didn't grab it on your way out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Strange, very strange indeed. Where is it now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In here, on my desk. I'm not sure what to do with it." Irena stared at it and continued slowly, "Did...anything...strange happen for you today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, why? Did something happen to you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've been having really odd dreams lately. And I've been drifting into waking dreams over the past few days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It could just be stress. I've gotten that kind of thing before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe..." Irena trailed off. "It was a long drive. I guess I'll read a bit and sleep if you don't mind."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"See you in the morning. Remember, off to game we go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Nyis, it's been a long time since you last surfed, right?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yeah, why?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Did you ever surf in Wahaii?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">No, when I was competing, it was too expensive, after that, I never really had the time to go. Why?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Katya, my kid sister, is working at the Wahaii Harem Club and they have a very liberal family vacation subsidy package. We could go to Wahaii, stay at a Maharaja Resort for a week, and they would pay half our costs. You could surf the islands as part of the deal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="pagecaption">Irena - The Game Company</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The alarm went off early, rousing Irena from a troubled night of sleep. Bleary eyes took in the time of oh-eight-fifteen. "What the fuck?" her brain asked, then she remembered and groaned. She rolled heavily out of bed and pulled on the first things she came across, black jeans, white scoop neck top, and her heavy, six buckle boots.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa was waiting for her in the kitchen, coffee in hand. "Here. I'm sorry about this, if it weren't a status meeting day we could have gone in later." Irena nodded and slurped coffee from the travel mug Nyissa had pushed into her hands. "We need to go. I forgot we need to get you set up with IT before the meeting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh," Irena mumbled through her coffee.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You want to drive?" Nyissa asked, headed for the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, been driving too much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa led the way to her small black sports car that seemed to be hiding between the massive trucks on either side. Irena slid into the passenger seat and stared at the strange harness arrangement. "Oh, sorry, been taking her to the track more lately. I like the racing harness better than the stock belts." Nyissa leaned over and showed Irena how to fasten the lap belt and the two over shoulder straps to the central hub. "You just twist it toward my side to get it loose." She backed out, spun right, and accelerated into traffic. She dodged the small sports car through the morning traffic with casual ease and slid into the underground parking for her office..</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The office looked different in the day. Light streamed in through the windows, people sat at computers in the cubes and offices, staring at the screens and typing from time to time. The smell of coffee drifted on the air currents and every so often a muffled curse rose from one location or another. Nyissa guided them through the maze of cubes to an office where a bearded guy sat. "Hey Greg, this is Irena, the new character artist. You have HR papers for her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right here. Top one is the offer, followed by benefits. She can sign the offer and non-disclosure agreement now and come back later for the rest. I know you have the status meeting this morning." Irena scanned through the non-disclosure and signed the forms. "Tricia has her login ready and has added her to the character creation groups and permissions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll show you where Sophia's office is after the meeting," Nyissa said as she motioned Irena to follow. Raised voices were muffled by the closed door, but the words could be heard, "I understand what you are saying, however, this is an adult title. It is not important that we gain maximum market share. This project has a guaranteed revenue stream."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's our reputation, though. When we go to another publisher for the next contract, we have to show what our last projects were. There are several large publishers that won't touch adult shops."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I understand your concern. If the issue is that serious, maybe we should move this in house and poach your talent. I'm sure we can better your pay package."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can't be serious!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Extremely. I am tired of fighting over this with you. I have assurances from our director that if this continues to be a contentious arrangement, I can move it to an internal project and hire the best talent I can find. Rani Corp has deep pockets, excellent benefits, and pays very well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, ok, you've made your point. It's you title, your business strategy, and your requirements."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can offer you this. Once we are done with this title, we will fund something you've wanted to do, doesn't matter what, and give you another non-adult credit when you go hunting for another project. Now, don't you have a status meeting?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena watched the others deliver status, form short and terse from some of the lead programmers to more coherent and elaborate from artists, voice acting, and marketing. "More complicated than I thought," was her comment to Nyissa as they walked into the cube farm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa motioned to an office on the far side and led the way in. "This was Sophia's office. Your login should be active by now." She motioned for Irena to sit, had her log in and then began running through the software Sophia had been using.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While Irena was staring at the windows on her monitors she said, "I know you wanted to have a realm for the internal preview, but it sounds like there's too much up in the air. How about you lock the hut and put the power crystals inside. That way there's still a place for them to walk through, but you don't have to finish an entire realm. This could be the starting methodology, you wanted players to explore their instances, or you could go back to the previous idea once the starting realm is ready."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know it's not ideal, but the hut is almost ready. The realm isn't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was going to say great idea. We can even test it before we have to turn it on. I'm going to run this by Fred and see if he agrees. You can look through the items Sophia was working on and let me know if you have questions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena spent the rest of the day learning how to use the character editing suite. It was close enough to some of the single player modding tools she had used that it almost made sense. She worked on the conversation Sophia had been working on. By six in the afternoon she had two-thirds of the main dialog set up and was looking at the secondary threads. The tedium of how conversations had to be done started to get to her. At six-thirty she walked over to Nyissa's office and let her know she was going to grab a cab and head home. "Just a minute, Irena, I need a break. I can drive you home and we can get something from Waverly's."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena's phone rang as they were pulling out of the game company lot. She answered it to hear the thick brogued voice of Thomas O'Malley, "Irena, you going to be around later tonight? I have something I'd like to talk over with you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should be. Say eight-thirty? I am just getting home and need to eat something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That would be good," he replied as he hung up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's odd, Tom O'Malley wants to come over and talk tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everything ok with the bars? I don't remember the last time we saw him outside of work related things."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everything's fine, as far as I know. We make good money off the students and O'Malley's has a solid set of regulars."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Want me to stay?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, go ahead and get back to it, once we're done with dinner. I'll call if it's anything serious." Irena called down to the kitchen with their order and waited for the chime on the dumbwaiter. While they waited, they talked about the game, concepts, designs, and various characters. They lapsed into silence one the food arrived, fish and chips for Irena and a burger with mushroom and Jamison sauce for Nyissa. As soon as they finished, Nyissa rose to go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Call if things get weird, or if you need to talk," Nyissa said as she pulled Irena into a long hug.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena responded with a quick kiss and replied, I will. Good luck tonight. I'd come back, but I'm not used to it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena couldn't think of any bad reason for Tom to want to drop by, but it didn't stop the nervousness from building until Tom's arrival, precisely on time. He cam in carrying a small earthenware jug, a bundle of papers, and his trademark woolen coat. "Evening, Irena," he lifted the jug and motioned at the table, "Glasses? This is the private reserve from my family's distillery in Eirleandra." He smiled at her raised eyebrows and continued, "I've come to offer a business proposal. You don't have to answer it tonight, but please think on it. I am getting older, no, don't shake your head, we both know it's true. I have no one to pass the business on to, so I propose to sell it to you. Sale price would be one hundred dollars and you would become complete owner of the bars, the properties, my house, and everything else. I'd ask that we split the profits in half and that I am allowed to remain in my house until my demise."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena almost dropped the glasses she was getting at his statements. "Are you serious, Tom? I can't take it for so little."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course you can. I'd give it to you, but the taxes on that kind of gift would kill the deal. You took my small, struggling, neighborhood tavern and turned it into a thriving business. I would have closed it down ten years ago if you and Nyissa hadn't taken it on and turned it into what we have today. It should be yours as reward for that." He poured generous amounts of amber liquid into the glasses provided and lifted his, "To new opportunities!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena hesitantly lifted her glass, tapped it with Tom's and took a careful taste. Thoughts of her day at the game company competed with the memories of all the great times at the bars. "It's an awesome offer, Tom. I would be honored to take it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's not much more to the task than what you do anyway, just a bit more tax and property items to settle up at the end of the year and Vern is one of the best tax guys around. We can sign these tomorrow. You can have Hanna go through them with you. You'll be seeing more of her, now that you'll be making the legal decisions instead of me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she can figure out the character creator because it is similar enough to game modding tools so by the end of the first day she has half of a dialog done for Tyana at the arrival of the new player. she wants to leave at 6 because she is burned out and tells Shan she'll grab a cab. Shan takes a break to take her home, they have dinner sent up from the pub, then Shan returns to work. Tom shows up with his business proposal - sign over the business to Irena with the provisos detailed in the Waverly's entry */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* REWORK - she goes in, looks around, realizes she has no skills, and bows out, agreeing to consult on story related items - she lasts a week at the game company before deciding she is willing to help with concepts, but not interested in changing jobs and becoming a game developer - too much to learn and too much stuff she has no aptitude for or interest in - her only interest is in the characters and stories, not in the tech details of programming or game dev */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* in some discussion - gaming company is questioning Rani Corp about hard line on some things, not the Adult nature, but game-play, partly based on forum feedback from closed, external, beta testers - Rani Group will basically state not interested in anything along the lines of "but in MMO X it was this way..." - reminder of alternate revenue stream for RotH - game will be as designed, with adjustments when truly unplayable items are found - during Beta/Open Beta Jaime should be present at the game company, on an extended assignment, to answer questions directly - she is authorized to make almost all decisions on the spot - Irena should be in the loop as well, in the end, Irena Shan, and Jaime form the triumvirate that makes the final calls - Shan's boss is not pleased by this and it may end up that Shan transitions to Rani Corp employment - might end up that Jaime assigns Shan as Product Manager for the game and Shan ends up overseeing her old boss - Awkward!! */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* keep in mind our hassles approaching Betas, think of frustrations as beta tester and frustrations with other testers - design team should interact with forum, Jaime and Rani Corp are not afraid to close threads and make statements such as "No, that will not change" when long pressure threads evolve. This should drive the game shop manager crazy since he comes from the background of never directly confront or smack down the testing group - it could reduce sales - there should be someone, either Rani Group or game company, that moderates the forums - closing threads that are no longer valid - for example, when a thread prompts a game change, the thread will be locked with a comment to start a new one once evaluating the new behavior */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* pre-release games for RotH - combine web, text message, phone, email, and chat - some include real-world areas, some show a few in-game environs, such as Hut Instances, the Great Souk in Sphere, etc. - first puzzle has to do with the Summoning Crystal and access to a Hut Instance "</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* support for social networks, need for external research to get through missions? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* CONSIDER: Kilashandra Mason, better yet, a friend of hers, has been an online supporter of CyCore games since she first encountered one of their titles. She could be in the Beta program for Realms of the Hut - could be recruited as a community manager, working remotely - this could be her connection and how she gets folded into Rani Corp - she will be hard-core about moderation of Beta forums - forums require reading the Beta rules of conduct and expectations, threads asking about items mentioned in Known Issues and Update Notes will be closed with comments to read the damn notes, troll threads will be deleted, threads without meaningful discussion of Beta will be deleted except those in Off-Topic and General Discussion areas, threads amounting to "polls" will be locked and threads asking for thoughtful comments opened in their place - this should ramp up while Kilashandra is not in school, so she can devote full attention - she will be on CyCore games payroll, transitioning to Rani Corp at launch */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* rules for closed tests - Read the Damn Release Notes before posting, Read the Known Issues before posting, Posts reiterating Known Issues or Release notes will be locked with a note to read the appropriate section, topics on behavior will be locked as soon as a patch changes behavior - a new thread will need to be started to analyses new behavior, trolls will be warned in private messages - after several warnings beta and forum access will be revoked, requests for characters surviving DB wipes or migrating into release versions of the game will be commented on and locked - no characters will be kept, Beta is for testing and reporting strange behaviors and the like and not for just playing the game, complaints of the "not ready for release" variety that contain no productive data will be locked - Rani Corp has specific goals that do not require this game to be a break-away hit, it just needs to be available to any that have interest, something that drives CyCore games crazy */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* AoSS - Association of Sight Seers - a group that will conduct players through various areas of the game on sight-seeing expeditions. The players cannot interact with anything in the areas, nor can they scope out the tricks and traps, but this is a way to see a dungeon if you are a Solo Player - alternatively - suggest a "Tourist Mode" where Solo Players can wander through the dungeons and lairs without being attacked, however, no experience, items, or benefits would be available except the chance to view the areas - this is another Irena complaint */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* flip the bus-dev angle on its head with this - remember, Rani Corp wants the game so they are Original Idea and Finance. CyCore isn't pitching to them, they are contracting with CyCore, a different approach for CyCore and not initially comfortable */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* move back Sophia's disappearance to closer to the start of game development. It needs to more closely match the Awakening of Shan and the realization by Rani Corp that Gates are real and a better solution than their original plan */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* REPOSITION */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* this section moves to where Irena is getting ready to start at CyCorpp Games. Jaime is in town to talk with the company head. Sophia has gone missing, but is missed because she was Community Manager for Conflict For Mars rather than the build-up for RotH Alpha */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was a typical mid-week night at Waverly's, with a medium crowd, but quiet overall. The dinner crowd was thinning out and the early bar crowd was starting to filter in when two people sat down to my left. Nyissa, my purple haired roommate, said, "Hey Irena, remember Jaime?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took me a moment but then I remembered, Jaime had run an intense role-playing game all through college. Nyissa and I had spent many an hour lost in her world. I looked closer at the woman next to Nyissa and recognition slowly dawned. "Jaime? What brings you back?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My company wants to hire CyCore Games to create an online game for us, using the Realms of the Hut worlds I designed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jim's being kind of weird about it, since he didn't come up with the concept," Nyissa added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait until we start discussing the details, he'll be even more uncomfortable," Jaime answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean?" asked Nyissa.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We want this game to be quite a bit different than what CyCore has done before. The rule-base should be close to the classless system I used with Realms of the Hut. We want the world to be dynamically updatable, so when the players change something, it can remain changed in the world going forward.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* add additional dialog here - this is where the theme park - sandbox discussion should happen, then move on to the adult nature of the game */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Then we want it to be fully adult with sex, sexual encounters, full nudity, and drug use. Not to mention the possibility of torture and harsh character death. Not permanent death of course, that's just too annoying. As usual, there will be a death penalty, in this case return to the hut instance for that character. We are internally discussing if we want to limit the numbers of items and make the dropping of them part of the penalty."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're right, Jim will not go for an adult title. Not only is he morally uncomfortable with even simple things, such as character nudity, but he considers adult titles to be the death of a studio. He thinks once you do an adult title, no one will take you seriously for non-adult titles going forward. While I don't completely agree with his views, I do question why you would want an adult title. It seems like all you'd attract would be the creeps."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, but how do you get the full range of human possibility if only violence is supported? And I have always wondered why violence is fine in the Meriksas culture, but sexuality is not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe," Nyissa hesitantly replied. "I'd be worried about the moderation necessary to keep the game from just being a creepy meat market for the truly sleazy. How would you encourage actual players to stay and reduce the sleaziod factor?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're trying to figure that out in design discussions at Rani Corp."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Make the game compelling to the actual gamers, make it something so different that it can't help but intrigue them. Then run at least two server groups. Move the sleazoids to one server as they pop up and keep the rest of the server clusters for those interested in actually playing in the game world," I suggested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could work," Jaime said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could also set up areas where characters couldn't go completely nude, at least at the start."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He'll go for it, though," Jaime said. "We are offering a lot of money for the project and there isn't anything else on the line-up for new concepts."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He might take the contract, but he will fight you at every step on the adult themes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* more discussion - at some point Irena will make the point about a sandbox game rather than a theme park game. Jaime will immediately be on board, Nyissa will be a bit slower, mostly because CyCore has no experience with sandbox games */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* pre-games will try and set basic background - messages at first will be pretty generalized because design is pending and will gather focus as the design progresses */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* will need to think through how testing effects starting conditions for launch. Will the game be reset to the original starting conditions or will the testers help define the new starting conditions by their actions during test */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Nehtan is 12 hours ahead of CyCore games */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Inn of the Six Toed Cat- use name somewhere */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* End of REPOSITION */</p>
