<p class="regtxt5">I guess I always knew I was different. My earliest memories are of not liking certain parts of me, but, at five years old, how do you ask your parents about feelings that you can't fully identify for yourself. It didn't help that they considered any questions that were uncomfortable to be unacceptable. I vividly remember making one of those silly kid statements and getting resoundingly thumped on for it. I had picked up a leaf for the dining room table and had said, "Look, I'm as strong as Jesus," because he was an often talked about figure in my home. Mostly how he was tortured and killed, after dragging a large cross up a hill. Anyway, my parents lost it at that. I was informed that my blasphemy was unacceptable, then spanked, then sent to my room. I was often spanked or told I was arrogant, selfish, and useless, especially after my brother was born.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I spent lots of time with my best friend Dan, at his house next door. His parents were open, warm, and inviting to the strange kid from next door. Dan had an older sister, Sarah, and a younger sister, Rachel. We would spend hours in his back yard, playing in the tree platform in the apricot tree and dodging the girls who always wanted to play house. I never liked playing house because I never wanted to be "mommy" or "daddy".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Worse were the dress up days, usually church days, where I would be forced into a miniature suit and paraded around with all the other kids. A short buzz cut was the style of the day and pictures were taken at every event, regardless of importance, then lovingly displayed at home to make sure they were worth keeping. I hated the way I looked, ugly bulbous head without hair to conceal the features and the uncomfortable, hot, and constricting clothing besides.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My feelings of oddness grew as I did. The continued pressure for perfect grades from my parents, on top of pressures to fit in at school, and the ever present religious training had me angry, withdrawn, and half crazy by the time I started middle school. When puberty started, I totally shut down, withdrawing so far only Dan could find me. I tried to get out of going to church, resenting the hell-fire and brimstone preaching more with each passing year. It felt like poison, unacceptable at home, alienated at school, and bound for hell because I was arrogant, rebellious, and even more selfish than when younger.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everything exploded when I started high school. We had to do some of our work on computers and my parents wouldn't have one. I had to do homework at school or at Dan's. My parents were freaking because they couldn't pre-correct my homework and assure themselves that their fuck up kid was doing it right. As a result I was able to search for things my parents wouldn't want me to see, including enough to figure out why I always felt wrong. Once I had the term, transsexual, the wealth of information was staggering, the number of porn sites overwhelming, and the solutions many.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There were some parts of the data that didn't make sense though. Many of the descriptions had the changed person turning into these ultra-frilly girly-girls. Or sneaking around wearing women's clothes, snuck from wives, girlfriends, sisters, and others. I would look in the mirror and imagine what I could look like, but I never had the desire to dress in my mom's stuff. Once in a while I would look at what Dan's older sister Sarah would wear and wonder, but only when she wasn't in dresses or heels. It didn't make any sense to me why the people I read about were so quick to leap into the ugly stereotypes of the fucked up gender roles of society. I wanted to be biologically female, but I didn't want to be the gender role of girl or boy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I struggled with my new knowledge, trying it on, imagining different things, roles, looks, but not wanting to actually make the change. Too many stories talked of struggles, abuse, bureaucratic nightmares trying to get a new name and status, and I desperately wanted to chicken out.</p>
