<p class="pagecaption">Shae - </p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae pulled the lavender van into the clearing and parked it next to the small sporty car already there. Beyond the stone ringed fire pit was a large tent. The fire was already lit and two people seated on the ground near it. One, a tall, thin girl with wavy dark red hair, was leaning against a well muscled man who was a few inches taller. Both were staring into the flames. At the sound of the van, they looked up, smiled and waved, they rose and walked to the van once it had stopped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They beat us again," Shae said to her companion, a woman with long yellowish green and brilliant blue hair, thin face, and prominent pierced nose.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Glad you two could make it tonight," the man said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dan, we left just after you. I can't help it you drive like a crazy person," Shae's passenger replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lara likes fast, you know that, Roxy. What really kept you, though? We had enough time to set up and get the fire going."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shae was late getting to my place," Roxy replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, Cindy Greylin showed up out of the blue and wanted to talk. It was weird. Let us get settled and I'll tell you about it over dinner."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Settled? I thought the van was your rolling palace," Lara said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is, but the telling would be nicer around the fire, with dinner in hand," Shae replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're cooking, right?" Dan asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae spun the captain's chair around and stepped through the beaded curtain into the back of the van. She pulled salad and pre-formed burgers from the mini fridge in the small open area behind the driving area and in front of the large bed in the back. Soon after the smell of cooking meat mingled with the smell of burning pine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As soon as everyone had a plate of food, Dan asked about Cindy again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cindy came into mom's tea shop just as I was heading to the van. I haven't really seen Cindy since we graduated from high school three years ago. She came in and shoved a large envelope into my hands, asking that I keep it for several weeks, until she came back for it. I think she was going to tell me more, but her father called and she spooked, running from the shop as if demons were on her tail." For a few minutes they talked about how strange it was, but the fire, the slowly sinking sun, and the faint breeze, gently stirring the fall leaves, soon took their minds off it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Dan went to grab a few more chunks of wood, Lara kicked together a pile of fallen leaves and collapsed back into them. "This is my favorite time of year. Fresh leaves, warm nights, and a clear sky with the promise of stars," she said as she lay back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For long moments there was silence. Shae and Roxy curled up with each other near the fire, Dan setting a couple more wood pieces on the fire, and Lara staring up at the sky. "Why do we chase so much crazy stuff as people?" Lara asked from her leaf pile. "We live in our safe little places, believing we control the world around us, just as the mewling godling many believe in tells us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"if it even exists..." Shae muttered, almost too low for Lara to hear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, it exists, it can't help but exist with centuries of energy poured into its form by its worshippers. Trouble is it is more psychotic than its followers, and it isn't in control of the multi-verse, any more than we are in control of this world. We have to live with this world as part of it, not as its masters. We forget this at our peril," Lara responded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara lay in the leaves for a long while after that, silently watching the sky and clouds. Eventually, she stood and moved trance-like into the forest, picking a path through the undergrowth toward a steep part of the hill-side. Dan followed her when she wouldn't answer his calls, Shae and Roxy trailing after. They followed her to a low cliff face and watched as she made her way along the scree at its base to a point at the most vertical part of the rock. She walked up to the face, turned sideways and slipped through the rock. The others stopped in shock, unable to believe what they had seen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy was the first to shake off the paralysis. She slowly picked her way to that place where Lara had last been, turned like Lara had, and edged sideways slowly. Instead of bumping into the expected rock, she felt a hint of cold, then saw a flat rock wall in front of her eyes. A narrow passage extended to her left, and another rock wall was at her back. Etched into the rock were various pictographs and odd runes, inlaid with an red-orange polished stone. Pulsing bluish white light came from the passage to her left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy started down the tunnel as Dan and Shae stepped through the concealed opening. They emerged to find Lara staring into a glowing ball of swirling and pulsing light, shifting across the color spectrum and roiling like boiling water. Directly between the entrance and the bubble was a short granite pillar with a black alabaster statue standing on it. The figurine was of a woman with unfurled bat wings and arms stretched out from her sides. Her hands pointed toward similar figurines one each side of her. Seven figurines were arranged in a ring around the pulsing bubble. Each column was placed in the center of a seven pointed star, formed of odd shaped runes inlaid in hematite.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara walked slowly to the nearest figurine, reached out, and set her hand on it. A bubble of red fog sprung up around the shimmering inner bubble and faint lines of red beamed between their hands. A second set of lines stretched from the tops of their heads to points of a seven pointed star inlaid in carnelian above the pulsing globe. Lara stared in wonder at the shimmering red fog. Slowly she reached out and touched it as Roxy shouted, "No!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara's hand stopped at the fog, held by the force of it, creating small ripples in the fog. She pulled her hand back, raised it in front of her face, and stared at it. Slowly she collapsed to the ground, staring blankly up at the cavern roof.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan rushed over, pulled her into his lap and shook her gently. "Lara, are you ok? Talk to us!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can see it. It's so incredibly beautiful. Lines, planes, spheres, universes beyond imagining, all linked and woven together in an infniite web of glory. I wish I could share it!" she finished as her hands reached up and held Dan's face. For an instant he could almost see it in her eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should head back, if we don't want to stumble to our camp in the dark," Roxy said. Lara nodded and Dan helped her to her feet. Soon they were back out on the scree, seeing the sun setting behind the far mountains.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Silence dominated the time around the camp fire, each person staring into flames and watching their own thoughts. They rose, almost as one, and headed to their places once the night was fully dark and the fire burned down, Shae and Roxy to the van, Dan and Lara to the tent. The evening remained quiet, everyone locked in their own thoughts until sleep claimed them one by one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy awoke to a sharp scream, turning to find Shae locked rigid, back arching her off the bed. "Shae, Shae, wake up," Roxy said as she shook her, gently, at first, then more firmly. Shae's body slowly relaxed, lowering her back onto the bed, but she did not wake. Instead she seemed to collapse in on herself, falling more and more limp until she almost melted into the bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After trying one more time to rouse Shae, Roxy pulled out her phone and called her mom. A sleepy voice answered on the fourth ring. "Roxy, are you ok? What time is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm fine, it's Shae. I can't wake her up and she seems to be fading."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fading?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Folding in on herself, breathing and pulse slowing gradually, and going more and more limp. I don't know what to do!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you..." the voice on the phone trailed off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Gods, no! I'd never feed from Shae, you know that!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, dear. I had to ask, though, since it sounds similar. Do you know what happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I woke to a scream. Shae was locked rigid, then she relaxed and kept on relaxing. She hasn't responded since."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy heard muted talking from the phone, then her mom said, "Your father suggests you take a peek. You remember how to do that, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought I wasn't supposed to do that to friends."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Normally, no, but it might be the only way now. Leave your phone on and let me know what you find."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy set the phone on the pillow and leaned over Shae. She pulled the blankets down and carressed Shae's breasts until they responded, then she reached lower, stroking her gently until she could feel Shae's body becoming arroused. She focused on the arousal, drawing it in, tasting it as if she were about to feed, then she wrapped it around herself and followed it down into Shae's awareness. Moving past scenes of the day and down deeper into her being until she came to a dark well. Summoning her courage, she peered over the edge of the well and gazed down into its depths. It fell away in a swirl of thin grey fog, lighted windows set into the wall cast dim flickers into the impossible depths. She was about to turn away when she saw a shape, held against a dark window by thick black tentacles.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly, she backed out, following her trail back to the van. "She's in the Well of Souls, held by tentacles at a dark window."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Roxy, are you sure?" a man's voice asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes dad."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're going to have to dive for her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, ok...but that will awaken her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It can't be helped and she will already be awakened by this, if you can get her out. She'll die otherwise. Call us immediately if anything goes wrong."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy stroked Shae again, until there was enough reaction to follow in once more. She slid back down to the dark well at the center and stood at the edge. One by one she shed the thoughts running in her mind. Camoflage went first, followed by thoughts of the strange bubble. The last and hardest to quiet were her fears for Shae. Slowly her form morphed into her true self. Her thin, gangly frame filled out into a lithe, willowy fulness. Her face lost a bit of angularity and sharpness, going from sometimes pretty to beautiful. Black bat wings sprouted from her shoulders and a prehensile tail grew from the base of her spine. She stepped into the well once she was finally able to focus all her thoughts on getting to Shae.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy fell toward Shae, drawn by her focus. She snapped her wings down and in, bringing herself to a hovering stop beside her. Thick black tentacles were wrapped around Shae, pulling her against the dark window in front of her. Shae's eyes were open wide, staring into the blackness. Her skin was fading to grey and the tentacles were slowly drawing her through the window, distorting it like thick plastic.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Pulling Shae's head to the side, Roxy kissed her with every bit of passion she could summon. A faint blush of pink warmed the skin around Shae's mouth. Encouraged, Roxy used her hands and tail to stroke Shae, carressing her, seeking to ignite lust and desire in her frozen girlfried. Little pink blushes would rise where she touched, a soft exhale, almost a moan, slipped from Shae's mouth. Encouraged, Roxy increased her actions. The tentacles shivered and grew thinner as Shae turned from grey and cold to pink and warm. The warmer she grew, the thinner and more insubstantial the tentacles became.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With a low moan of desire, Shae twisted into Roxy's arms and clung to her, kissing her deeply. Roxy whipped her wings back and down, hard, pushing them toward the mouth of the well. Cresting the edge snapped her eyes open, into Shae's warm brown ones, back in bed in the van. Swiftly Roxy reset her camoflage and held Shae close. "You were having a nightmare. I'm here, I will protect you, sleep now," her soft, reassuring words and ability to compel soon had Shae drifting back into sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy hadn't thought she could sleep, but her phone woke her a while later. "Roxy, would you and Shae mind joining me for breakfast? I don't want to abort your camping weekend, but I'd like the company of my daughter and her friends. Lara and Dan can come too, if they'd like." Roxy didn't hear much of the message past "abort", the key word she and her mom would use if they really wanted or needed something.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, sure, we'd love to. Where and when?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lara's favorite place, around seven? That should give you time to get there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We'll be there." Roxy hung up and turned to Shae, shaking her gently. "Hey sleeping beauty, wake up. My mom wants to see all of us for breakfast."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wha, now, why? Can't we see her tomorrow?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's had a bad night and really wants to see us. She doesn't expect us to stay, so we can come back after and get most of the weekend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae looked at how serious Roxy was and answered, "Sure, when do you want to leave?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As soon as we get dressed and I tell Lara and Dan they can come along, if they want." Roxy dressed quickly and sprinted over to the tent. "Lara, Dan?" She waited until she heard sleepy voices before continuing, "My mom wants us to join her for breakfast. It sounds kind of serious. I'd like both of you to come too, please?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was a short, hushed conversation in the tent before Dan answered, "Sure, give us a couple minutes to dress and a couple more to grab the valuable stuff. Is there room in the van or do we need to drive too?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's room."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae pulled up to Sarah's Diner, on the road south out of town. Sarah's was a classic diner, all chrome, curves, large windows, and neon. Inside it was long and narrow, a row of settees along the windows and stools at the counter. Several brightly clad waitresses hurried about, taking orders, bringing food, and filling coffee cups. Sarah, chief cook and owner, waved to them as they entered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy's mom had set down the paper and waved them to her table as they walked in the door. She passed a note to Roxy, who read it, and passed it along. Shae stared at the words, "Order, eat, act normally. Once we are done, I need to talk to all of you," before passing it along, trying to keep a neutral expression on her face. There was little conversation while they waited and then ate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the parking lot, Roxy's mom tossed her bag and cell phone into her car, then turned to Shae. "Could you drive us somewhere away from here? I will explain as we go." Everyone piled into Shae's van and she drove off away from town.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mom, you are acting really freaky. What's going on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae's phone rang just as Roxy's mom was about to answer. "Honey, I know you're camping, but could you meet me at Edward's place? It's anemergency. Cindy's father just left our shop after being very threatening. I called the police but they accused me of starting the problem. They said they'd arrest me if I persisted."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something's really weird. My mom wants me to meet her at her boyfriend's because Cindy's father showed up being abusive. I have to go see her now," Shae broke in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's what I need to tell you, Cindy Greylin was found dead this morning. It was ruled suicide before I even examined her. Detective Perry and I are not as certain, however, we were informed that there would be no investigation and there would be extreme disiplinary action should we continue."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dan, could you drive" Shae asked. "I'm too worried to be safe." She waited until veryone was in the van and it was moving before saying quietly, "I saw Cindy die. I don't know how it happened, but it I was looking out her eyes, like through a window. I hoped it was just a nightmare. Her father and a friend of his had lifted her over the gard railing of the Higgins Street Bridge, planted her feet on the bottom of the railing and leaned her back over the drop. They were clenching her upper arms, leaving deep bruises, while her father screamed questions at her. He demanded to know where a key was, something her mom had given her. When she refused to tell him, he dropped her off the bridge. I was in her as we fell. Gods, how could someone do that? How could he just kill his own daughter?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was silence in the van as everyone tried to process what they had heard. Roxy wrapped her in a tight hug as her mom said, "I saw the bruises when she was brought in. Her injuries are consistent with falling backward from the bridge."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But what was he talking about?" Lara asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, but Cindy left a large envelope with me yesterday, just before Roxy and I left. She asked me to keep it safe until she came for it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan pulled the van into a parking space in the riverfront park area near the Mara Theatre building. Shae grabbed a large envelope from a storage area under the bed in the back of the van. They walked through the shops in the riverfront level of the building and stopped at the elevators. Inside the car Shae swiped a card over a small detector, then settled back as the car rose to the top floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The suite of rooms that greeted them were sparsely elegant, minimal in terms of furniture and clutter, with a couple of very nice pieces of art on the walls. Edward Stark and Felicity, Shae's mother, were seated in comfortable chairs, talking in normal tones. Stark gestured toward the kitchen counter across the room and said, "Wine or other drinks if you want them." Lara slipped over and grabbed a small glass of scotch while Shae and Roxy settled on one end of the large couch. Dan and Lara joined them once Lara had her drink.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy's mother settled herself into a single chair as Roxy said, "Mr. Stark, this is my mom. She is the chief medical examiner for the city."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please, call me Ed or Edward."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you can call me Isabeau," answered Roxy's mom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fi was just telling me Mr. Greylin acosted her this morning and was very unpleasant. The paper reported the suicide of his daughter. So, what do you know?" Stark asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cindy was killed. It wasn't suicide," Isabeau answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think it has something to do with this," Shae said as she tossed the large tan envelope on the coffee table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Felicity took a knife from the kitchen and carefully pried up the wax seal, then slid it under the flap until she could work the legal envelope open. She pulled out several folded sheets of yellowed paper and a long key. A single page letter covered several pages of a deposit box agreement. Felicity held up the letter and read it aloud.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dearest Cindy,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">If you are reading this, I died before you reached adulthood. I am so very sorry for that.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I don't know how to explain, but I will try. Your father is involved in something terrible, something with deep roots and very creepy. I don't know exactly what, but I have overheard troubling things. He's part of a group searching for people called the monitors. There was mention of destroying demonic influences, of the need to see God'swill done on earth, and of ancient evils that needed to be stamped out.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Things became worse after a visit to your grandmother. She talked to me about a family heirloom and how she was passing its keeping to me. She never said what it was, just gave me the safe deposit key with this letter. Your father changed after that. He started watching me, following me, and having a couple of others watch when he wasn't around. He asked about the heirloom often, urging me to see what it was. The more he pressed, the more reluctant I became.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Last night, the night before I am writing this, I heard him on the phone. It was one of the times he wasn't in the same room with me. I managed to overhear some of the call, something about gladius dei and about how to make someone talk.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Today I am going to the bank to make sure you are listed as able to access the box, number 257. You will need to verify yourself using things from our past since I can't take you without your father knowing about it.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I have retained a lawyer, Amber Dudek of Volakis, Dudek, and Weston, hopefully without your father's knowledge. Her firm will hold this letter for you and deliver it on your twentieth birthday if anything happens to me. Ms. Dudek will be able to help you verify your identity with the bank. Contact her as soon as you can after reading this.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I love you and wish I could have been there for you,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Mom</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Gladius Dei, oh shit!" Roxy muttered from a face gone white. "My family has been the target of those crazies before. Several of my relatives were killed and others driven out of their homes. Once they become convinced you are 'demonic' they won't stop until you are destroyed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought they were an urban myth," Stark commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, they're horribly real, Somewhat secret, and just about everywhere. Their symbol is a shield with a flaming sword. Some of the local police are members, primarily the leadership," Isabeau answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Seriously?" Stark asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Seriously. My aunt Aelitha tried to question one. It was a lucky chance she even caught him, but once the questions started, there was a soft thump sound and his liquefied brains spilled out his nose and ears. Aelitha was going to have my mom take a look, but the body disappeared on the way to the morgue. Creepy and grotesque, I know," Roxy added when she saw the rest of them start at the vivid image.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm curious," Stark said, rising and walking to a door. "Come into my office and let's see what we can find." The office consisted of a glass topped desk and a huge wall screen. His hands flew across the top of the desk and windows glowed into life. He made another gesture and the wall screen lit up, duplicating the desk. "I dabble," he said to the look of techno-lust on Dan and Lara's faces. "I let Fred March handle the day to day things and dabble at this and that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How is Fred?" Felicity asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fred is, competent, however, not nearly as adept as you were and the stick up his ass makes him very hard to deal with. Oh, sorry," he said as he remembered Lara in the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't be. You are telling it like it is."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An encyclowiki entry flashed onto the screen saying "Hierarchy of the Damned, redirected from Monitors". The article said little other than Gladius Dei considered this group to be an enemy of the faithful and they were supposed to hold arcane knowledge of the dark arts. The article on Gladius Dei was quite a bit longer and had links to history and related pages. Everyone was quiet as they took in the many covert purposes it covered, from papal security to providing inquisitors up until the inquisition was disbanded only forty years before. "Right," Roxy said as they read that the pope had disbanded Gladius Dei twenty years before. "My family's troubles were after their official disbanding. Besides, who can resist the temptation of a private security force."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stark broadened the search and found many conspiracy theory pages mentioning it. Most of the information on those pages was strange enough to be suspect.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We need to find out what is in the safe deposit box."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How? The bank will have seen the papers and will know Cindy's dead," Felicity said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stark was reading through the agreement and spoke, "The lawyer can get in, as the executor of Mary Greylin's affairs. Problem is, we don't know who is in Mary's will."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lara, she used to talk to you, didn't she?" Dan asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, sort of, before my change she would talk to me, but it just seemed too weird to be real."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What would she say?" Felicity asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She claimed to be a descendent of some Tuar't'zani queen. That she had a birthright that her mom promised her and that it would change her life. Supposedly she could trace her ancestry back through her mother's line to a queen named Tyan Hanan of the Tuar't'zani," Lara continued.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait, did you say Tyan Hanan?" Stark asked. "My sister, Shar, is President of the Natural History Museum in Yew Nork. She told me about Herbert Kodetova, a world famous researcher of the Tuar't'zani, finding the tomb of Tyan Hanan last year. There's quite a bit of mystery about that time period and the tomb's contents increased it. For example, the written form of Tuar't'zan is exactly the same as the high writing of the Zeltaaran peoples of Patrea, over three thousand kilometers away. Drift could account for it, but the written forms appears simultaneously. Tyan Hanan was crippled, but she united the Tuar't'zani tribes and forged a trading empire that spanned the great desert. None of the records found have any indication of where she came from. She can't be traced to any of the established powerful tribes of the time. Local legend says she fell from the sky after communing with the dead to demand better things for her people. Her crippling was the price of her requests."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you saying she might not have been crazy?" Lara asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who can say? It would be possible for her to have that lineage, even with her looking so Meriksan. What else did she say?" Stark answered. His hands were flying over a keyboard image on the screen, pulling up page after page of legal documents.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much about herself. I think her mom had a younger sister, Karen, somewhere on the east coast. She talked about her grandmother some, but grandma died the year we were talking a lot," Lara replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah-ha! Mary Greylin, maiden name Mary Tintziri Talafique, married Andrew Greylin in 1978. One sister, Karen Talafique, married Kasha Arfassa in 1985, currently living in Yew Nork. And Fred wonders why I love technology," Stark laughed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My bet would be Karen is the next in line for the key, but Greylin would know all about Mary's family. There must be a plan," Lara commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There was. I just found a news item where Karen and Kasha Arafassa-Talafique were killed in a car wreck a day ago. The police are still looking for the driver of the car that hit them. The final section of the box agreement establishes Volakis, Dudek, and Weston Law Offices as custodians and bequeaths the contents of the box to Herbert Kodetova at the Museum of Natural History in Yew Nork. We might be able to work with this. I have used Amber Dudek as my personal lawyer from time to time. I should be able to get Shar to authorize me to act for the museum long enough to see what is in the box. We will have to turn over the contents to the museum, but it will get us a look.I am seeing Amber on Monday to go over some contracts, so I can ask her then."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stark was going to continue when a message window popped up saying, "Edward, Ms. Dudek is here for your appointment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please excuse me for a while. There are some negotiations I will need to engage in over the next few days. I am meeting with Amber today to discuss these. May I recommend you stay here until they are finished? I will bring Amber up and we can consider the next steps."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Shae and Roxy need to talk about the well and awakening. They allneed to talk about the sphere. Lara wants to look for the symbols she remembers under the Fredricks mansion. Fi wants to stay at Starks's rather than go back to the shop alone. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* should see a paper, either at the diner or in Stark's apartment about the visit of the Rani. Local law and Meriksas government are scrambling to provide security and arrange a "suitable" welcome for a head of state. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm being monitored. Several people at work know things they couldn't without watching me after hours. What I am going to tell you is something that is being suppressed. This morning I was called in to examine a body found around 0400. The body belongs to Cindy Greylin and her death was declared a suicide before I even saw her. I was told not to investigate, Detective Perry was toldnot toinvestigate, and everyone involved was threatened with disciplinary action if we didn't comply. My quick look at the victim showed her death was not a suicide. There were..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bruises on her upper arms where her father and a friend of his held her over the drop. They had lifted her over the gard railing of the Higgins Street Bridge, planted her feet onthebottom of the railing and leaned her back over the drop. Her father screamed questions at her. The conversation was:<br/>
FATHER: Where is the key, you stupid quim? I know your mother gave it to you. Where is it?<br/>
CINDY: I don't know about any key. You're hurting me!<br/>
FATHER: I'll kill you if you don't tell me where it is. Did you give it to that lady-boy abomination you were seeing in school, or to the slit licking cooze at the Tea shop?<br/>
CINDY: I don't have any key<br/>
FATHER: Give me the key you useless whore!<br/>
CINDY: (spat in his face)<br/>
FATHER: You are dead to me. (as he dropped her from the bridge)," Shae narrated.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How?" Lara asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought I was having a nightmare last night, but I was there, I saw everything from Cindy's eyes, hear her father. I was following her down from the bridge when something rescued me and I woke up. How did I see this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're a reader, which makes you sensitive. Was Cindy a close friend?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, but she had come over yesterday and handed me a large letter. She was talking about how her father was scaring her lately."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything else happen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan and Lara looked at each other, then at Shae and Roxy, "Should we?" Roxy nodded slowly, followed by Shae. "Ms. Faust, we'd like to show you something.Shae, could you take us back to the camp site?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae'sphone rangas the van headed easton the freeway, toward the turn-off for the camping area. "Shae, couldyou cometo Edward's place immediately?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um, I..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's an emergency. I'm here because Mr.Greylin came by and was very threatening. I called the police, but they wouldn't send anyone. We need to talk, it's about your friend Cindy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And the Three Sisters charged the Daughters of Arascheya to guard and protect the Gates of the Multi-verse unto the end of all things. And the Daughters shall find and charge Monitors in each Realm to assist in this task." Lara spoke in a strangely resonant low voice. She turned and stared at her friends, her eyes filled with the same swirling, pulsing color as the gate. Once she finished speaking she dropped to the cavern floor like a puppet with cut strings. /* runes are the Arascheyan Script - for now use Cthulhu Runes - if publish will need to create something that wouldn't be copywritten */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan ran to her and helped her up. Lara doesn't remember speaking or finding the cave. When she sees the runes she remembers seeing something similar in the tunnel between the carriage house and the mansion on the Fredricks estate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The blonde haired girl slid in through the door of Madam Felicity's Tea Room, glancing furtively behind her as she did. She clutched a battered black packsack in her left hand and pushed the door with her right. Her eyes darted left and she started to the right when she didn't see anyone in the tea room. Madam Felicity was behind the counter in the shop side of the store, sorting through tins of biscuits and tea. "Hi Ms. Anders. Is Shae doing a reading?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cindy, I'm Felicity, remember, not Ms. Anders. Shae's in the kitchen, cleaning up. You can go on back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks," Cindy replied. She turned and walked stiffly toward the kitchen door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cindy, are you ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, yeah, I'm ok enough." She pushed through the heavy bead curtain into the kitchen and watched as Shae cleaned the various baking pans. "Uh Shae, can, can I talk to you for a few minutes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course," Shae answered, puzzled by Cindy's nervousness. "Just let me finish the last of these." She slid the pans through the rinse and into the drain rack then turned back toward Cindy. "Ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cindy looked around, eyes twitching from point to point in the room. "Some place more private, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, how about the reading room?" Shae headed toward the tea room at Cindy's nod. She crossed to another beaded curtain, pushed through it and walked to the second door on the left. Cindy followed her in and took the client's chair, sitting on the edge of the chair rather than settling back. Shae sat in the reader's chair, "What's up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need you to keep something safe for me. I don't trust my family any more. They're watching everything I do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok," Shae started to say.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cindy pulled a large envelope out of her pack, opened it, pulled out a legal sized envelope, and set it on the table. Its contents were thick enough to give it a slight bulge. "This came from my mother, through a law firm downtown." Cindy stared at it for a while, flipping it over to stare at an elaborate wax seal on the back. "Why would she leave me something, I mean, she couldn't have known she would be in a car accident, could she?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could open it..." Shae started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not yet.I know I sound paranoid, but my father would know somehow. You need to keep it for me, for a few weeks anyway, until things feel better at home."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's going on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's just it, I don't know. About a month ago he started asking me all kinds of questions, about Dan, about Lara, and most of them were focused on the Fredricks Estate. He demanded to know everything Dan or Lara might have told me. He was most insistent." She lifted her top and turned so Shae could see belt marks across her back. Some deep enough to have drawn blood. Shae's hand was on her phone before she realized she'd pulled it. "No, if you call the police it will be worse."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But that's abuse. You need to get away before it happens again!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. My father has friends all through the police. I don't dare risk it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And he didn't say why he was so interested in the Fredricks?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, just kept asking what they were doing, how far they had gotten with the repairs, if they had seen anything of historical note. It was all very strange." She stopped, pulled her phone out of her pocket, and turned white when she saw who had sent her a text. "He's demanding to know where I am. Hide this, keep it safe, I'll come back when I can. I don't dare do anything that would make him wonder where I was today." Cindy shoved the envelope back into the larger one, picked up her bag, and ran from the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae's mother came in while Shae was still staring at the envelope. "What happened? Cindy ran like hell hounds were on her tail."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't really know. She came in and asked me to hold this for her. Then her father texted her and she ran out. I'd like to put this in the secure place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course," her mother replied. They rose, went to the back of the store and descended into the basement. Behind the furnace they both pushed two random stains on the cracked brick wall. A small section swung out to reveal a large wall safe. Shae placed the envelope on a shelf with a stack of old books and documents.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The incident continued to puzzle both of them, during the rest of the day in the shop, at dinner, and when they were talking in the evening. Thoughts kept Shae awake until midnight, when she slipped into a fretful sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She sprang up in bed some time later, thinking she had hear a scream. Her phone showed three in the morning. After a long time, she was able to return to sleep.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">The smell of coffee greeted her as she made her way to the kitchen the next morning. Her mom was sitting silently staring at the morning paper. Rather than speaking, she silently turned the paper so Shae could read it. On an inner page was a picture of the Higgins Ave bridge and the headline, local girl jumps to her death. The small story revealed that Cindy Greylin was thought to have jumped from the bridge around three in the morning and was found on the rail bed just after dawn. There were no witnesses and no indication the incident was anything other than suicide.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A furious pounding on the shop door startled them out of their thoughts. Felicity rose, being more dressed than Shae and went to answer it. Shae trailed along behind, staying in the shadows, out of sight, but close enough to back her up. The shouts were easily heard, "What did that bitch daughter of yours say to Cindy that would make her do this? I know she was here, her phone GPS tells me. Tell me immediately what she said and I won't get this place shut down."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mr. Greylin, you need to leave now. We will talk to you when you aren't distraught." Shae was already dialing the police as her mother spoke.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'll tell me now! Get that bitch daughter of yours down here. I told my Cindy to stay away from your kind, you and your pervert daughter, sleeping with girls instead of men and reading those demonic cards of hers." Police sirens could be heard in the distance. Greylin spun on his heal, snarling, "This isn't over. I'll bring charges. You are finished in this town!" His car sped away as a police cruiser pulled up in front.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An hour later the police left, with full statements from Shae and her mother. They had told them the basics, Felicity holding back about the letter and Shae holding back about the abuse. Once the police were gone they had returned to the kitchen, leaving the store closed for the morning. Shaky hands were sipping cold coffee when the back door opened and a woman with lime green and brilliant blue long hair slipped in. A tall man walked in behind her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Roxy?" Shae asked as the woman hurried over and hugged her hard from behind. Shae struggled up and turned to hold her lover tight. Roxy was a couple of inches taller, a bit thinner, with an angular face, prominent nose, and brilliant violet eyes. Piercings adorned her nose and lips.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The man had pulled Felicity up and was holding her close as well, stroking her hair and murmuring in her ear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hope you don't mind that I brought Mr.Stark along. I heard what happened from my mom, and I have to tell you something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, looks like it's fine that he came. What did you tell him?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A teaser for the real parts. You know my mom is the chief medical examiner, but I haven't told you much about her. She has this uncanny way of almost talking with the dead, a way of seeing the hidden almost immediately. She was called in to examine Cindy. Cindy was killed. She didn't jump. Mom found the marks from a belt, bruising indicating she was held over the edge of the bridge, and other signs of torture. When she tried to tell the investigators, they told her to stay out of it. Someone with a lot of power is burying this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It could be Greylin himself. That man has the ear of a lot of the police department. He isn't a businessman, like he claims. He's something else, something that snoops through this town like rats through trash. He's crossed paths with me a couple of times. There is something he is looking for and it's not one of the usual things," Stark added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He seemed like a nasty man this morning," Shae said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">What do you mean?" Stark asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He came pounding on our door first thing this morning, demanding I tell him what I said to Cindy. Said he knew she was here from her phone," Shae replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not possible," Roxy added. "Her phone wouldn't have been released from evidence yet. I know they declared Cindy's death a suicide, but Detective Marta Perry wouldn't signoff that quick on an open investigation."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's right," Stark said. "I've dealt with Detective Perry. She's too good a cop to signoff on anything until she is satisfied. She would if directly ordered, but she'd take as long as she could, just in case. Cindy's father must have been following her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae looked at her mom, made eye contact, then they both nodded slightly. "We might have something with a clue to what's going on," Shae said as they slowly disentangled themselves from their lovers. "We need to go get it." Shae set the envelope on the table when they returned. "Cindy gave me this yesterday, just before she went home." Shae tipped the large envelope up and the sealed legal envelope slid out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Felicity picked up a knife and started to pry up the seal. "Wait a second," Stark stopped her. "Maybe we should take this back to my offices. Just to be sure we aren't interrupted. We'll have to go separate, I didn't expect company so I brought the sports car."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae and Felicity looked at each other, then slowly nodded, almost as one. "You might be right. I don't think Greylin would break in, but he was quite agitated earlier. Shae, could you take Roxy in your van?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shae can ride on the back of my bike. That way I don't have to come back for it later," Roxy suggested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Keep an eye out, see if you can see anyone following us," Stark added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Felicity and Stark left first. Shae stopped to grab her helmet as she followed Roxy, reaching the back door just as her phone rang. "Slow down Dan, I can't follow. What happened?" She held up a hand to stop Roxy. "No, we're off to Stark's place at the Mara Theatre building. You should come there, we're discussing the same things. See you there and be careful!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What was that about?" Roxy asked after Shae closed her phone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Greylin accosted Lara outside the Fredricks place, started yelling at her, all sorts of nasty stuff, after shouted questions. Lara's pretty freaked out." They climbed on Roxy's bike and started down the street. As they passed a large blue truck, Shae noticed the flash of a camera lens quickly being lowered. They saw another parked car with long lens camera near the Mara building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan and Lara pulled up as Shae swung off the bike. Lara a bit more pale than usual, but she seemed calm, if a bit distracted. Her gaze swung immediately to the other car, then back to Dan as she gave a tiny twitch of a nod. They walked through the shops in the riverfront level of the building and stopped at the elevators. Inside the car Shae swiped a card over a small detector, then settled back as the car rose to the top floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The suite of rooms that greeted them were sparsely elegant, minimal in terms of furniture and clutter, with a couple of very nice pieces of art on the walls. Edward Stark and Felicity were seated in comfortable chairs, talking in normal tones. Stark gestured toward the kitchen counter across the room and said, Wine or other drinks if you want them." Lara slipped over and grabbed a small glass of scotch while Shae and Roxy settled on one end of the large couch. Dan and Lara joined them once Lara had her drink.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dan, tell everyone what you told me," Shae requested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara spoke first, "Greylin accosted me as I was getting in my car to go to work. He demanded I tell him about every conversation I had with Cindy over the past years. When I refused, he started with the insults, at first general, then about my altered state. At first I thought it was grief, but it really wasn't. He didn't seem to care about his daughter, other than she hadn't told him something," she took a stiff slug from her glass, hands shaking only slightly. "After that, Dan came down and we backed slowly away. He tried to follow us onto estate lands, but Dan managed to get the gate locked before he could shove it open. Does anyone know what he wanted?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This," Felicity said, waving the letter from Cindy. Felicity took a knife from the kitchen and carefully pried up the wax seal, then slid it under the flap until she could work the legal envelope open. She pulled out several folder sheets of yellowed paper and a long key. A single page letter covered several pages of a deposit box agreement. Felicity held up the letter and read it aloud.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dearest Cindy,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">If you are reading this, I died before you reached adulthood. I am so very sorry for that.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I don't know how to explain, but I will try. Your father is involved in something terrible, something with deep roots and very creepy. I don't know exactly what, but I have overheard troubling things. He's part of a group searching for people called the monitors. There was mention of destroying demonic influences, of ancient evils they needed to stamp out.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Things became worse after a visit to your grandmother. She talked to me about a family heirloom and how she was passing its keeping to me. She never said what it was, just gave me the safe deposit key with this letter. Your father changed after that. He started watching me, following me, and having a couple of others watch when he wasn't around. He asked about the heirloom often, urging me to see what it was. I wouldn't do it.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Last night, the night before I am writing this, I heard him on the phone. It was one of the times he wasn't in the same room with me. I managed to overhear some of the call, something about gladius dei and about how to make someone talk.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Today I am going to the bank to make sure you are listed as able to access the box, number 257. You will need to verify yourself using things from our past since I can't take you without your father knowing about it.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I have retained a lawyer, Amber Dudek of Volakis, Dudek, and Weston, hopefully without your father's knowledge. Her firm will hold this letter for you and deliver it on your twentieth birthday if anything happens to me.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I love you and wish I could have been there for you,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Mom</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Gladius Dei, oh shit!" Roxy muttered from a face gone white. "My family has been the target of those crazies before. Several of my relatives were killed and others driven out of their homes. Once they become convinced you are 'demonic' they won't stop until you are destroyed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought they were an urban myth," Stark commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, they're horribly real and very secret. And, since they are fanatics, they will make sure they can't be questioned," Roxy answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Seriously?" Stark asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, seriously. My aunt Aelitha tried to question one. It was a lucky chance she even caught him, but once the questions started, there was a soft thump sound and his liquefied brains spilled out his nose and ears. Aelitha was going to have my mom take a look, but the body disappeared on the way to the morgue. Creepy and grotesque, I know," Roxy added when she saw the rest of them start at the vivid image.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm curious," Stark said, rising and walking to a door. "Come into my office and let's see what we can find." The office consisted of a glass topped desk and a huge wall screen. His hands flew across the top of the desk and windows glowed into life. He made another gesture and the wall screen lit up, duplicating the desk. "I dabble," he said to the look of techno-lust on Dan and Lara's faces. "I let Fred March handle the day to day things and dabble at this and that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How is Fred?" Felicity asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fred is, competent, However, not nearly as adept as you were and the stick up his ass makes him very hard to deal with. Oh, sorry," he said as he remembered Lara in the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't be. You are telling it like it is."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An enclyclowiki entry flashed onto the screen saying "Hierarchy of the Damned, redirected from Monitors". The article said little other than Gladius Dei considered this group to be an enemy of the faithful. The article on Gladius Dei was quite a bit longer and had links to history and related pages. Everyone was quiet as they took in the many covert purposes it covered, from papal security to providing inquisitors up until the inquisition was disbanded only forty years before. "Right," Roxy said as they read that the pope had disbanded Gladius Dei twenty years before. "My family's troubles were after their official disbanding."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stark broadened the search and found many conspiracy theory pages mentioning it. Most of the information on those pages was strange enough to be suspect.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We need to find out what is in the safe deposit box."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How? The bank will have seen the same paper we have and will know Cindy's dead," Felicity said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stark was reading through the agreement and spoke, "The lawyer can get in, as the executor of Mary Greylin's affairs. Problem is, we don't know who is in Mary's will."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lara, she used to talk to you, didn't she?" Dan asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, sort of, before the change she would talk to me, but it just seemed too weird to be real."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What would she say?" Felicity asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She claimed to be a descendent of some Tuar't'zani queen. That she had a birthright that her mom promised her and that it would change her life. Supposedly she could trace her ancestry back through her mother's line to a queen named Tyan Hanan of the Tuar't'zani," Lara continued.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait, did you say Tyan Hanan?" Stark asked. "My sister Shar is President of the Natural History Museum in Yew Nork. She told me about Herbert Kodetova, a world famous researcher of the Tuar't'zani, finding the tomb of Tyan Hanan last year. There's quite a bit of mystery about that time period and the tomb's contents increased it. For example, the written form of Tuar't'zan is exactly the same as the high writing of the Zeltaaran peoples of Patrea, over three thousand kilometers away. Drift could account for it, but the written forms appears simultaneously. Tyan Hanan was crippled, but she united the Tuar't'zani tribes and forged a trading empire that spanned the great desert. None of the few records found have any indication of where she came from. She can't be traced to any of the established powerful tribes of the time. Local legend says she fell from the sky after communing with the dead to demand better things for her people. Her crippling was the price of her requests."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you saying she might not have been crazy?" Lara asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who can say? It would be possible for her to have that lineage, even with her looking so Meriksan. What else did she say?" Stark answered. His hands were flying over a keyboard image on the screen, pulling up page after page of legal documents.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much about herself. I think her mom had a younger sister, Karen, somewhere on the east coast. She talked about her grandmother some, but grandma died the year we were talking a lot," Lara replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah-ha! Mary Greylin, maiden name Mary Tintziri Talafique, married Andrew Greylin in 1978. One sister, Karen Talafique, married Kasha Arfassa in 1985, currently living in Yew Nork. And Fred wonders why I love technology," Stark laughed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My bet would be Karen is the next in line for the key, but Greylin would know all about Mary's family. There must be a plan," Lara commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There was. I just found a news item where Karen and Kasha Arafassa-Talafique were killed in a car wreck a day ago. The police are still looking for the driver of the car that hit them. The final section of the box agreement establishes Volakis, Dudek, and Weston Law Offices as custodians and bequeaths the contents of the box to Herbert Kodetova at the Museum of Natural History in Yew Nork. We might be able to work with this. I have used Amber Dudek as my personal lawyer from time to time. I should be able to get Shar to authorize me to act for the museum long enough to see what is in the box. We will have to turn over the contents to the museum, but it will get us a look."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stark was going to continue when a message window popped up saying, "Edward, Ms. Dudek is here for your appointment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please excuse me for a while. There are some negotiations I will need to engage in over the next few days. I am meeting with Amber today to discuss these. May I recommend you stay here until they are finished? I will bring Amber up and we can consider the next steps."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you the business meetings the Matriarch of Ranistan is here for? I saw the big splash in the papers yesterday," Lara asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My uncle was a monitor. His papers are in a secret area on the mansion grounds," Dan said quietly. "It's written in a language I can't read, though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I heard the term once from Cindy as well. Back when we were in high school and before my, change," Lara added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider changing this slightly - have stark suggest heading to his place, a more secure location, then opening the letter from Cindy. It would make research easier.

She was crippled in the crash of a shuttle. Those who survived the crash had to rely on the locals to help them. Tyan Hanan used this to claw her way to power and establish early Tuar't'zani culture.

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe my mom could help. She has some uncanny ways of getting information from the dead," Roxy pulled out her phone, flipped it open, then closed it again. "I should talk to her face to face."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you think Greylin could be listening in on our phones?" Shae asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, but mom was told to stop any close examination of Cindy's body and Detective Perry was told to stand down. Gladius has a lot of covert pull," Roxy answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do we know about Cindy?" Felicity asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everyone answered with not much, except LAra who remained silent. "Lara?" Shae asked.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">"We could fake up an ID, get into the box and see what the thing is," Roxy said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Normally, yes," Stark replied. "But think of how the letter was worded. Her mom was scared silly and trying to hide something. She'd set up the requirements with a verification that would be hard to fake. If I were doing this, I'd use an event that was private to myself and the other person, memorable to both, but unlikely to be known by anyone else. We would need to know everything we could about Cindy at the age when her mom died."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I might be able to help," Roxy said, pulling out her phone and starting to text.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How?" Felicity asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait," Stark said at the same time. "My turn to be paranoid. We don't know what resources Greylin has. You should talk to your mom directly, and make sure no one follows you when you go. I suggest Roxy talks to her mom, you open the store as usual, and I will return to work. Tonight I will host dinner at my place, which I can easily secure, and we discuss results."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ms Wilson cam in for her weekly mid-morning reading, her usual time. "What's the question of the week, Ms. Wilson?" Shae asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My daughter is thinking of hooking up with a man in her classes at the university. Would it be a good match?" She settled in and shuffled the round deck and handed them back to Shae. Shae started the spread, drawing the xxxx first. The card swam in her vision, darkening into a black vortex pulling her in. Lighted windows peered out through the black walls, flickering by as she was swept down until she was pulled into one. Images flickered and solidified into a room filled with images of a man. "Shae, Shae, what does the card mean?" The voice drifted down from a great distance, tugging at Shae's focus. She was pulled back into the vortex, emerging in a different window. In this one was a room of images of a man looking at himself, a miasma of rot drifted on a slight breeze, and dark tendrils floated around, pulling at and tearing through images that weren't of the man. /* update this with concepts about man as some type of vampire-like or possessed thing from beyond the veil that has Sandy under its control */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shae," the voice called again, followed by a faint shuddering in the fabric around her. She was pulled backward out of the vortex and slammed back into her body, nausea clawing at her throat and guts. For a long moment she held herself still, fighting to not vomit on the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ms. Wilson stood next to her, her hand still on Shae's shoulder. "I'm sorry, dear, but you were white as a sheet and trembling. Are you ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry, Ms. Wilson, but I, I don't know what just happened. Let me look again." This time the card was just a card and she was able to lay out the rest of the spread. It painted a picture of the man in question similar to what she had seen, narcissistic, self-absorbed, and a user of those around him. She tried to paint the image in a less terrible way to Ms. Wilson, but every card screamed "Bad Idea" concerning the relationship. "Would your daughter be receptive to a reading? Everything I see is against this relationship."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, Shae. She was always skeptical, but, now that she's at university, she is convinced I'm throwing my money away on your readings. I keep telling her they are always right, if a bit cryptic some times."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's not going to listen to you on this. She is infatuated with this guy and I'm not sure how to pry her loose."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could I get a second reading on that question, either today, or when you have another opening?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae flicked her phone and called up her calendar. "I have time now, how about half price since you're here and the last one was quick?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Full price, but now is fine, if you're sure you are alright?" Ms Wilson replied, laying the money on the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae shuffled the cards back together and handed the deck to Ms. Wilson, who shuffled them thoroughly before handing them back. Black flickers edged the cards as she laid them out. When she turned over the resolution card she was sucked back into the vortex, to the first lighted windows, and in. Images resolved faster this time, as well as a boarded over door to one side. Most of the images were a dorm room, friends, and the man from the first question. One faded image showed two young girls in the back of a classroom. Faint tendrils tied the picture to the door. Shae stared at the door, watching it turn transparent, then foggy. She drifted through it, into a shrine filled with pictures of the two girls going from young to most of the way through high school.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shae?" This time Shae pulled herself back through the room, into the vortex, and up to the cards.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What happened to Sandy in high school, around junior or senior year?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Her best friend, Wendy, moved away. Her parents relocated to Angelicanos, in Lafronica, for a job. It broke Sandy's heart to lose her absolute best friend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did they stay in touch?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sandy tried, but Wendy never sent anything back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Think of Wendy and pull a card for me," Shae said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Wendy's family caught wind of the relationship between the girls, separated them, and kept Wendy out of contact until she moved away. By that time, Wendy was convinced Sandy wanted nothing to do with her and faded away. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Lara becomes Gate Controller - insert when Lara goes to the gate for the first time */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara woke late in the night, coming wide awake in the moon lit tent. She lay for a while, litstening to Dan breathing next to her and staring at the top of the tent. Sleep did not return. Instead, something called to her, faintly, from the forest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Eventually she slipped out of the sleeping bag, carefully, so as not to wake Dan. She slipped on a long white T-shirt and her underwear and stepped out into the night. Outside a full moon hung high in the sky. The wind had stopped and everything was still and silvery.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The call came fromdeeper in the trees, down the hill, toward the strange cave they had found earlier. Lara hesitated only a moment before following the call. She slid into the cave and walked directly to the glowing red field and placed a hand on it. Words formed in her mind and an opening appeared. She walked through and stepped into the energy bubble within.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stepped out into a small, bubble room, with a narrow passage directly in front of her. The walls were swirling green and black fog, solid to the touch, but neither warm, nor cold. The patterns were almost hypnotic, drawing her in, leaving her standing in place for what could have been seconds or years, she couldn't tell which.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finally she shook her head and broke free. Behind her was a shimmering distortion in the wall, where she had stepped through. Instead of returning, she walked down the narrow passage, which emerged into a large room with seven additional passages leading out of it. Six were the same narrow tubes that she had emerged from. The seventh was larger and went only a short way until it entered the side of another tunnel which stretched off to the left and right.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara walked to the tunnel and stared off intothe distance of it. There was nothing in sight except empty tunnel stretching away. She walked to the wall across it and touched it. At first it felt solid, but as she moved her hand around it, feeling the texture, it softened and split open in an iris shaped opening. Stepping through, she found herself in a featureless fog of green and black. Just ahead of her was a set of seven descending passages, clustered in a circle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A brighter green glow emanated from the tube where the iris had closed behind her and a similar glow pulsed on the section of ground between the seven passages down. Her curiosity led her deeper into the fog. The green glows remained behind her, waiting to guide her back. A silent wind lifted and played in her hair. Likethe walls, it neither warmed her nor chilled her. The further she ventured into the fog, the more at peace she felt, as if she had come home to a safe place. Stress dropped from her like a weight and she spun in place, arms outstretched, glorying in the utter relaxation, atlastsinking to the soft ground and laying back to stare into the patterns of the fog.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly a nagging thought intruded into her peace, a sense she was forgetting something. It drifted closer, reminding her of friends left in a different place. Reluctantly she climbed to her feet and looked around, afraid she was lost. The green glows were beacons that led her back to the strange tunnel and the iris wall.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her phone showed only two hours had passed fromthe time she stepped fromthe tent until she returned to it. She slid back into bed next to Dan and snuggled close, immediately falling back to sleep.</p>
