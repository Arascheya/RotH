<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Story starts between end of high school and end of college? Need to determine - these are younger than the Rani Corp people, more contemporary with Shan and Talia in Yew Nork.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/shae_anders.htm">Shae Anders</a>, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/dan_fredricks.htm">Dan Fredricks</a>, and <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/lara_march.htm">Lara/Lenny March</a> stories - starts with Cindy dropping off a book before suiciding out because of abuse in her family. Shae works at a new-age shop her mom runs, Madam Felicity's Tea Room, near the university. Dan and Lara met Shae during high school. Dan and Lenny were friends since first grade andDan was very supportive when Lenny became Lara. Dan and Lara became lovers after the change and have been together since. Lenny went away betweenJunior and Senior year and came back Lara. The change has been accepted by some, but there were pockets of nastiness for the senior year. Dan and Shae stuck with her, as did other friends.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cindy had a crush on Lenny and thought he might carry memories of one of the Z elders, but after the change she wasn't sure what to think. This is why the Tharth Book and her copied out excerpts end up with Shae. Determine if there is more information than what is in <a href="../../gm_resources/info/cobra_book/tharth_bk_extracts.htm">Tharth Book Extracts</a>. Can fill in some ofthe details from it if needed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shae owns the <a href="../../common/story_images/vandwg.jpg">van</a> that appears in the image of a van and a semi pulled up in a clearing filled with autumn leaves, somewhere in a mountainous area. They are there because Shae's card said something important would happen in their favorite spot. The clearing is in the forest, a fair ways out of town, and in a spot they found years ago.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">New-Age shop has small tea room, books, herbal remedies, a lounge area where people can sit, sip tea and read or talk, a couple of rooms for tarot, palm, tea, or crystal reading. Shae uses one room, the other room is shared. Shae is the best reader in the shop, with acuracy approaching <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/jsolitaire.htm">Jaime</a>'s.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gladius Dei, Sword of God, mission is to cleanse the world of thedemonic and find how they are getting into the world. Their knowledge is vague, their understanding poo, of the truth of Gates and Awakened. Most of the time they end up targetting people who are "other" rather than actual Awakened. In the case of Roxy's family, they hit actual Awakened</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Knights Templar 1119-1312 - in 1307 was the famous arrest, trial, and execution of many Templars - this was carried out by the Gladius Dei, a new order under Pope Clement V, established to combat demonic influence in all its guises. The Gladius were officially tasked with the Inquisitorial operations - the Grand Inquisitor was also the head of the Gladius. Gladius Dei members were the first Church personnel to discover references to The Monitors and the gates they protect. It is part of their Holy Writ to externinate the Monitors and secure the Gates from hellish incursions. Since they do not unserstand the Gates or their significance, their approach causes more trouble than it solves. Gladius Dei has used the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_Sant%27Angelo">Castel Sant'Angelo</a> as their headquarters since their inception. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* The Monitors - came into existence as assistants to the Asylum portal security group, a group sent to secure newly formed gates as a protective measure for Sphere. The portal security group will often place gate locking artifacts on worlds that have no Awakened in the general populations. If there are Awakened in the Realm, then the security group will work with them to determine the best actions for that realm. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Tuareg font is used for Tuar't'zani and Zeltaaran writings. In the Zeltaaran culture, it is only used by the elites for religious and special documents. Common communication uses armaic. The Gate Monitors use their own language, based off the Arascheyan font (cthulhu font), originating from the succubus culture of the 666th layer of the abyss. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* use Missoula as location for this group. Someone named Karen, Roger? Look up Sinti for more gypsy women faces */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* some ideas for magical properties of some crystals: <a href="http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/bookofshadows/tp/Crystals.htm">Magic Properties</a> */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sarah's Diner - traditional style diner - favorite hang-out for the locals with some road traffic to keep it busy. Lara started working for Sarah in high-school. Sarah was always very accepting of Lara, being one of the first places Lenny would dress as Lara once she started her transition. Sarah would let Lenny change into Lara at her home behind the diner and then introduced her to the rest of the staff as Lara.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara and the Gate</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* scene: Lara kicks through the leaves then flops down in them, staring up at a partly clouded sky with a red sunset starting, "We forget that destruction is the other side of creation. We live in our safe little world, believing we control the world, just as the mewling godling many believe in tells us."<br/>
SHAE: "if it even exists..."<br/>
LARA: "Oh, it exists, it can't help but exist with centuries of energy poured into its form by its worshippers. Trouble is it is more psychotic than its followers, and it isn't in control of the multi-verse, any more than we are in control of this world. We have to live with this world as part of it, not as its masters. We forget this at our peril."<br/>
She lays in the leaves for a long while, silently watching the sky and clouds. After a while, she stands and moves trancelike into the forest and toward a steep part of the hill-side. She doesn't answer when Dan calls to her. They follow her to a cliff face where she walks along the scree at its base to a point at the most vertical, then she walks up to the face, turns sideways and slips through the rock. Roxy is the first to go after her. Inside the narrow passage are runes, set by the Monitors, that hide the opening. The tunnel goes in to a round chanber containing a Hell Gate, a swirling, pulsing globe of all colors and no colors. Around the gate bubble were strategicaly placed seven black alabaster succubus figurines. Each figurine was set in the center of a seven pointed star formed with runic writing inlaid with hematite. Inlaid above the bubble was another seven pointed star of runes in carnelian. "And the Three Sisters charged the Daughters of Arascheya to guard and protect the Gates of the Multi-verse unto the end of all things. And the Daughters shall find and charge Monitors in each Realm to assist in this task." Lara spoke in a strangely resonant low voice. She turned and stared at her friends, her eyes filled with the same swirling, pulsing color as the gate. Once she finished speaking she dropped to the cavern floor like a puppet with cut strings. /* runes are the Arascheyan Script - for now use Cthulhu Runes - if publish will need to create something */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan ran to her and helped her up. Lara doesn't remember speaking or finding the cave. When she sees the runes she remembers seeing something similar in the tunnel between the carriage house and the mansion on the Fredricks estate.</p>


<p class="regtxt5">/* consider: Cindy drops off letter, Shaeand friends go into the woods to their favorite spot, Lara makes here pronouncement about living with the world, they find the gate, Shae has nightmare where she sees Cindy's death, Lara has nightmares - at least it is mentioned the next morning, then Shae's mom calls - freaked out- and asks Shae to come home right away, mom has paper open to CIndy's death and tells about Greylin coming around and screaming nastiness at her, consider what next, including Roxy finding out her mom thinks Cindy was killed - does Greylin accost Lara and Dan? */</p>
