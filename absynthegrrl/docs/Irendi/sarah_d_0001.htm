<p class="pagecaption">Sarah Chapter 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sarah looked out of the shattered window of the ruined factory, into the grey of the rain soaked street. Tears streaked silently down her face as she remembered the warm house, clean clothes, and regular meals. Her clothes were filthy, damp, and cold. She hadn't eaten anything except for rotten fruit yesterday, picked from the dumpster behind Fritshawns grocery. A small amount of rain water, for drinking, remained in the rusty can she had placed under one of the many leaks in the roof where she was hiding.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two weeks ago, the day after her fourteenth birthday, she had been coming home, only to find five men raping her mom, then killing her. She had crouched in shadows, shaking, crying, and trying desperately to not make a sound, hoping they hadn't seen her. Her call to the cops was answered far more quickly than she would have thought, but when they arrived, the first two officers were two of the attackers. She fled out the back, running and losing herself in the south Cagocha middle class neighborhood she lived in. She had heard a shout as she darted through the back gate, letting her know her getaway was not clean. After that, she ended up dodging patrols that drove her further south and east. The last run had brought her to the edge of The Hood, the most crime riddled, beat down, and desperate section of south Cagocha. No one would willingly enter this part of town. Even the authorities contained the zone rather than trying to police it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She had only known regular middle class life. It crossed her mind for the countless time that she would die alone in the ruined factory where she was hiding. What skills did a regular girl have for surviving among people and conditions she knew nothing about.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some sixth sense told her she was no longer alone. Trying to move as if she hadn't tensed up, she walked to her small pack and pulled out the paring knife she had grabbed on the way out of her home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A deep voice said from the shadows of the doorway, "Very good, little kitten. You have claws and a sense about you. You managed to slip into The Hood without anyone noticing. Tell me, could you cut me with that little claw of yours, or would you freeze?" A large medium dark skinned man stepped through the door. He was roughly handsome, well muscled, and dressed in combat boots, fatigue pants, and a black hooded sweatshirt. He wore a large grin and was eying her with more humor and curiosity than threat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sarah backed closer to the wall, holding the knife like she had seen in the better martial arts movies, and said shakily, "Cut, cut you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's see, shall we?" He closed in, moving quickly for a man of his size, easily dodging her clumsy attack. She reset and tried again, putting a bit more into it and almost connected. He backed away a bit and said, "Good, little kitten. I can train you, if you wish. First, however, you need to meet the Headmaster. If she gives her blessing, you may stay here, in The Hood."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who, who is the Headmaster?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Headmaster is the law in The Hood. She protects those that live here and casts out those that are unfit. There are only a few rules in The Hood. Do not fuck over a Hoodie, keep your word to a Hoodie, do not talk of Hood business with those not of The Hood. Keep to those and you will be safer than in the outside. Now, will you come or do we need to fight for real?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll come," Sarah replied. She grabbed her bag and followed the man out, into the rain, and through the rabbit warren of narrow streets between tall brick buildings, all showing signs of wear and neglect. He led the way to a stately six story brick building. It had been a glorious building once, as was revealed by the intricate patterns in the brick, the ornamentation, and the stained glass windows. The outside was grimy, some of the lower windows boarded over, and the walkway to the door cracked and buckled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The same sense that had served Sarah in the factory had her looking carefully around as they approached their destination. There was a brief flash of light on metal from the roof. A curtain stirred slightly in a third floor window. The man motioned for her to open the door. As she did, two other men, to each side of the door, dropped the barrels of their automatic weapons to the floor. "Caught the little ghost, did you, Nashan?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Over in one of the factories. Bringing her to see the Headmaster." He motioned to the right and said to Sarah, "We can wait in here, little kitten. The Headmaster is always busy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The wait was shorter than Sarah feared, however,it was long enough for her to reach a high state of worry. She rose on shaky legs when one of the gunmen motioned for them to go ahead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two floors up they entered a well appointed office, with a stately, handsome woman sitting behind the desk. A thin girl, all eyes in a heart shaped face, sat quietly behind her. "So, you are the ghost that has drifted into our world. Do you have a name?" The voice was soft, friendly, and laced with a confident power.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sarah, ma'am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And what brings you to The Hood, Sarah? You must know this is considered a very evil place by the outsiders."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had nowhere else to go," Sarah replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And why is that?" the Headmaster asked. Sarah explained what had happened. "Artemis Gideon, a ruthless, nasty piece of shit. She was a very brave woman, your mom, for trying to testify against him. We've had run ins with Gideon, even here. Have the rules of The Hood been explained to you and do you accept them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes Ma'am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are a Hoodie now. I am Headmaster or Zerina, not ma'am. We don't see outsider police very often, but you should stay to the deeper parts of The Hood for a few months, just in case. Since you are still school age, you will be expected to attend classes. Don't look so surprised, we have a school here and it's a damn sight better than most of the ones in the outside. I want everyone growing up here to have options in their lives. What is your age?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fourteen, I just turned fourteen, ma, Headmaster."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The same age as my daughter, Jaime," she motioned to the girl behind her. "Jaime can help you settle into classes. The Hood is a barter based economy, so you will be expected to contribute, not right away, but as time goes on. Do you have any skills at this point?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sarah shook her head as Nashan said, "Little kitten, Sarah, has good guardian instincts. If she wants, I can train her as a guardian."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I..." Sarah started to say.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't have to decide right away. You will need a place to stay. For now, I can offer you a room in this building, until you decide where you would like to be," the Headmaster added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Headmaster, I would like to train as a guardian."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Headmaster's eyes rolled back in her head and her body locked rigid for several long minutes. Nashan and the girl looked on without concern while Sarah stared nervously at her. She spoke in a monotone voice once her eyes started to track again, "Sarah and Jaime stand at the cusp of great change. At the Sacred Mountain they shall shake the foundations of the world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Nashan will train Sarah but comment later to the Headmaster that he is worried about her anger and coldness, that she has no problems killing non-Hoodies and considers the outsiders to be vermin. Jaime can moderate her through her friendship and direct some of the anger into more productive outlet. Zerina will ask both Jaime and Nashan to comment. Jaime sees a very compasionate, caring person, mentioning how disturbed Sarah was when Lucy was found mostly dead under the freeway. Nashan will talk about Sarah studying forensics texts, special ops and tactics books, and torture manuals from all points in history.*/</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* later in her training Nashan will admit she has picked up weapons skills faster than anyone and her inate grasp of tactics is better than any he's seen. */
N: I am going to make a suggestion that I'd like you to think about. There is one more tool you can add to your skills. You are a beautiful young woman. With a bit of training, you can employ that to your advantage.
S: <skeptical> Seduction? That just sounds creepy
N: Men get stupid in the presence of beauty. Most of the time you don't even have to let them touch you to influence what they tell you or do. Think about it and if you have any interest, you can ask the Headmaster for more details.
S: I'll think about it. <neutral tone>
/* sfter much thought she will ask for training. The Headmaster will find a couple of people that can teach her and she will get good at it. It doesn't come as naturally as weapons and tactics, but she does get good at it */
