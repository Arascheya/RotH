<p class="pagecaption">Roxy - Chapter 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy pulled her phone out of her jacket and checked the number before answering. "Lara, hey, what's up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you run me up to our favorite camping place? Dan's busy and I'd like to get out of the city for a while."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess so. When do you want to leave?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As soon as you are ready."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty minutes later Roxy pulled her motorcycle into the driveway of the Fredricks mansion. Lara was sitting on the main entrance steps, wearing her usual grey T-shirt and tight black jeans. Roxy tossed her a spare helmet and she climbed on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Half an hour later Roxy slowed the bike to a stop under the trees, near the stone fire pit. The spot was a clearing, at the end of a narrow dirt road, high in the mountains surrounding their home town. Remains of their last fire were still in the pit. Flame colored leaves covered the ground and Lara took a few minutes to scuff her way through them, smiling, without a care in the world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later she turned to Roxy, "I want to look at the cave again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure that's a good idea?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, however, I need to see it again. You can wait or come with me, it's up to you." Lara started into the trees,  picking a path through the undergrowth toward a steep part of the hill-side. Roxy followed her to a low cliff face and watched as she made her way along the scree at its base to a point at the most vertical part of the rock. She walked up to the face, turned sideways and slipped through the rock. Roxy hurried to follow, slipping through what appeared to be solid rock, into a narrow tunnel beyond. A narrow passage extended to her left, and another rock wall was at her back. Etched into the rock were various pictographs and odd runes, inlaid with an red-orange polished stone. Pulsing bluish white light came from the passage to her left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy followed the tunnel until she emerged to find Lara staring into a glowing ball of swirling and pulsing light, shifting across the color spectrum and roiling like boiling water. Directly between the entrance and the bubble was a short granite pillar with a black alabaster statue standing on it. The figurine was of a woman with unfurled bat wings and arms stretched out from her sides. Her hands pointed toward similar figurines one each side of her. Seven figurines were arranged in a ring around the pulsing bubble. Each column was placed in the center of a seven pointed star, formed of odd shaped runes inlaid in hematite.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara walked slowly to the nearest figurine, reached out, and set her hand on it. A bubble of red fog sprung up around the shimmering inner bubble and faint lines of red beamed between their hands. A second set of lines stretched from the tops of their heads to points of a seven pointed star inlaid in carnelian above the pulsing globe. Lara stared in wonder at the shimmering red fog. Slowly she reached out and touched it. It pulled away from her hand, leaving an oval openning she stepped through. She turned back to Roxy and asked, "You coming or staying?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Staying," Roxy answered, sitting down on the stone outside the red wall.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara stepped into the roiling energy bubble and stepped out into a small, bubble room, with a narrow passage directly in front of her. The walls were swirling green and black fog, solid to the touch, but neither warm, nor cold. The patterns were almost hypnotic, drawing her in, leaving her standing in place for what could have been seconds or years, she couldn't tell which.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finally she shook her head and broke free. Behind her was a shimmering distortion in the wall, where she had stepped through. Instead of returning, she walked down the narrow passage, which emerged into a large room with seven additional passages leading out of it. Six were the same narrow tubes that she had emerged from. The seventh was larger and went only a short way until it entered the side of another tunnel which stretched off to the left and right. In the center of the intersection was a faded seven pointed star. The purple point was directly in front of the short passage she had emerged from.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara walked to the tunnel and stared off into the distance of it. There was nothing in sight except empty tunnel stretching away. She walked to the wall across it and touched it. At first it felt solid, but as she moved her hand around it, feeling the texture, it softened and split open in an iris shaped opening. Stepping through, she found herself in a featureless fog of green and black. Just ahead of her was a set of seven descending passages, clustered in a circle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A brighter green glow emanated from the tube where the iris had closed behind her and a similar glow pulsed on the section of ground between the seven passages down. Her curiosity led her deeper into the fog. The green glows remained behind her, waiting to guide her back. A silent wind lifted and played in her hair. Like the walls, it neither warmed her nor chilled her. The further she ventured into the fog, the more at peace she felt, as if she had come home to a safe place. Stress dropped from her like a weight and she spun in place, arms outstretched, glorying in the utter relaxation, at last sinking to the soft ground and laying back to stare into the patterns of the fog.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly a nagging thought intruded into her peace, a sense she was forgetting something. It drifted closer, reminding her of Roxy left in a different place. Reluctantly she climbed to her feet and looked around, afraid she was lost. The green glows were beacons that led her back to the strange tunnel and the iris wall.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She emerged back into the cave, stepping out of the bubble and startling Roxy, where she was sitting on the floor. "How long was I gone?" Lara asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ten minutes, why?" Roxy was staring at Lara as she spoke. "What happened to you in there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean?" Lara asked, nervousness in her voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your eyes have green and black shadows flickering in the irises and your hair has green and black highlights. Do you feel any different?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I feel amazing, at peace, calm, for the first time I can remember. You've got to see what's there! It's incredible, a place between the worlds, a vast network of tunnels and passages to anywhere there is one of these energy things. They stretch across the multi-verse like an infinite web of pearls."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara grabbed her hand and pulled her boldly into the energy bubble. Roxy's startled scream was cut off as a moment of cold blackness led to stepping out into the tunnels Lara had seen. Roxy stared at the green fog, drifting and swirling, confused and at home, at the same time. She was startled by Lara's hissed, "What the fuck?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara was staring at her. When she looked down, she could see why. Her camoflage had dropped and she was standing in all her natural glory. Leathery black wings arched up from her back. A prehensile tail sprouted from the base of her spine. Her thin and angluar frame had filled in just enough to make her stunningly attractive. Her clothes lay shredded at her feet. She hadn't noticed when the change destroyed them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, that is cool, really weird, and a bit disturbing. What just happened?" Lara asked, beginning to recover from her surprise.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, I, well, as you can see, I'm not exactly as I appear. I'd say there's no good way to explain, but there's no good way to explain this either. I am a succubus, from a long line of succubi. My mom wanted out of the politics of our home and brought us to your world just after I was born. We have to hide, for reasons that should be very clear to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah," Lara answered bitterly. "Many humans are fuck-tards when it comes to anything different."</p>
