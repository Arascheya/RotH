<p class="pagecaption">Roxy - Chapter 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* first person try - see which works better in the long run */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We pulled into our favorite camping spot early Friday night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* third person try */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy pulled the purple van up the driveway near the Fredricks Mansion. It was finally starting to look like a mansion again, instead of a building on the way to falling down. Dan's parents had inherited it, with the condition that they rehab the mansion and live on the property.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan and Lara were waiting on the front steps, small bags sitting next to them. They hopped in as soon as the van stopped, tossing their bags on the large bed in the back. Lara settled into the seat next to Roxy and Dan in the passenger seat, just behind Lara. She loooked at her two friends, like she always did, taking in Dan's well-muscled build and Lara's thin, etherial, almost fae look. Lara had come late to womanhood, having spent until his junior year as skinny, nervous, and beat down Lenny. Once she made the change, she had blossomed into a beautiful woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara had suffered a lot for her new self. Her family disowned her and threw her out of their house because of her "perversion". High school had been a torment, between threats of rape, verbal and physical abuse, people refusing to accept her new status, and fights over which athletics classes and locker rooms she could be in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan's family had been her one bastion of safety. They took her in and gave her incredible support, helping to undo some of her emotional damage. The three of them had become inseparable over the years, supporting each other through the rough transition from the teen years to young adulthood.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy put the van in gear and headed out of town, toward the logging road and their favorite camp site. It was fall, just after the leaves had fallen, and still warm enough for comfort. The camp site was high up in the mountains, looking down on the Hub of Five Valleys as the area around town was called. It had a fire pit, formed by a ring of stones, a level area for parking the van, and towering trees to keep the heat of the day off. Dan and Lara had found it when they were drving around in high school and it had been their favorite place since. They had never seen signs of others using the area.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara leapt out and kicked her way through the leaves, bringing a genuine smile to Roxy. Lara loved the fall and turned into a little kid when the leaves were on the ground. After kicking through them for a whle, she methodically kicked up a huge pile and flopped back in it, staring up at the trees. Dan started a small fire while Roxy pulled out a grate and food to be cooked over it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After dinner was done and cleanup finished, Lara returned to her leaf pile and stared through the trees, out over the cliff near the campsite. "This is my favorite time of year. Fresh leaves, warm nights, and a clear sky with the promise of stars," she said as she lay back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For long moments there was silence. Dan and Roxy curled up with each other near the fire and Lara staring up at the sky. "Why do we chase so much crazy stuff as people?" Lara asked from her leaf pile. "We live in our safe little places, believing we control the world around us, just as the mewling godling many believe in tells us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"if it even exists..." Dan muttered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, it exists, it can't help but exist, with centuries of energy poured into its form by its worshippers. Trouble is, it is more psychotic than its followers, and it isn't in control of the multi-verse, any more than we are in control of this world. We have to live with this world as part of it, not as its masters. We forget this at our peril," Lara responded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Been talking to your parents again?" Roxy asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, just got another letter from my brother. He wanted to remind me to listen to religious radio and pray for help in turning away from my perversion. Same thing as always. He wants me to be in his version of the afterlife with him," Lara replied. Roxy could hear her struggling to keep her tone mild, but the underlying bitterness filtered through.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara lay in the leaves for a while after that, silently watching the sky, clouds, and the late afternoon sunshine through the trees. Eventually, she stood and moved trance-like into the forest, just back from the cliff, until she found a steep ravine to follow down. Dan followed her when she wouldn't answer his calls, Roxy trailing after. She scrambled down the ravine and emerged at the base of the cliff, where she made her way along the scree at its base. She stopped at a point directly below the campsite, walked up to the face, turned sideways and slipped through the rock. The others stopped in shock, unable to believe what they had seen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy was the first to shake off the paralysis. She slowly picked her way to that place where Lara had last been, turned like Lara had, and edged sideways slowly. Instead of bumping into the expected rock, she felt a hint of cold, then saw a flat rock wall in front of her eyes. A narrow passage extended to her left, and another rock wall was at her back. Etched into the rock were various pictographs and odd runes, inlaid with a red-orange polished stone. Pulsing bluish white light came from the passage to her left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy started down the tunnel as Dan stepped through the concealed opening. They emerged to find Lara staring into a glowing ball of swirling and pulsing light, shifting across the color spectrum and roiling like boiling water. Directly between the entrance and the bubble was a short granite pillar with a black alabaster statue standing on it. The figurine was of a woman with unfurled bat wings and arms stretched out from her sides. Her hands pointed toward similar figurines one each side of her. Seven figurines were arranged in a ring around the pulsing bubble. Each column was placed in the center of a seven pointed star, formed of odd shaped runes inlaid in hematite.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara walked slowly to the nearest figurine, reached out, and set her hand on it. A bubble of red fog sprung up around the shimmering inner bubble and faint lines of red beamed between their hands. A second set of lines stretched from the tops of their heads to points of a seven pointed star inlaid in carnelian above the pulsing globe. Lara stared in wonder at the shimmering red fog. Slowly she reached out and touched it as Roxy shouted, "No!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara's hand stopped at the fog, held by the force of it, and creating small ripples in it. She pulled her hand back, raised it in front of her face, and stared at it. Slowly she collapsed to the ground, staring blankly up at the cavern roof.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dan rushed over, pulled her into his lap and shook her gently. "Lara, are you ok? Talk to us!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can see it. It's so incredibly beautiful. Lines, planes, spheres, universes beyond imagining, all linked and woven together in an infniite web of glory. I wish I could share it!" she finished as her hands reached up and held Dan's face. For an instant he could almost see it in her eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should head back, if we don't want to stumble to our camp in the dark," Roxy said. Lara nodded and Dan helped her to her feet. Soon they were back out on the scree, seeing the sun setting behind the far mountains.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Silence dominated the time around the camp fire, each person staring into flames and watching their own thoughts. At last Roxy said, "I think I've seen some of the symbols near the entrance before." She scratched a couple in the soft dirt near the fire.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In the tunnel from the carriage house to the mansion," Lara siad. "There are similar ones in the wall close to the mansion basement entrance. I never gave them much thought."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider: had played the game of you show me yours second year jr high - that's when Lenny first stated he wanted to be Lara, Roxy showed herself as a succubus, and Dan came out as bi. It was also the time they first explored each other's sexuality and forged the triad they remain */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need to get a descrip of Roxy in here somewhere */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy pulled her phone out of her jacket and checked the number before answering. "Lara, hey, what's up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you run me up to our favorite camping place? Dan's busy and I'd like to get out of the city for a while."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess so. When do you want to leave?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As soon as you are ready."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty minutes later Roxy pulled her motorcycle into the driveway of the Fredricks mansion. Lara was sitting on the main entrance steps, wearing her usual grey T-shirt and tight black jeans. Roxy tossed her a spare helmet and she climbed on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Half an hour later Roxy slowed the bike to a stop under the trees, near the stone fire pit. The spot was a clearing, at the end of a narrow dirt road, high in the mountains surrounding their home town. Remains of their last fire were still in the pit. Flame colored leaves covered the ground and Lara took a few minutes to scuff her way through them, smiling, without a care in the world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later she turned to Roxy, "I want to look at the cave again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure that's a good idea?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, however, I need to see it again. You can wait or come with me, it's up to you." Lara started into the trees,  picking a path through the undergrowth toward a steep part of the hill-side. Roxy followed her to a low cliff face and watched as she made her way along the scree at its base to a point at the most vertical part of the rock. She walked up to the face, turned sideways and slipped through the rock. Roxy hurried to follow, slipping through what appeared to be solid rock, into a narrow tunnel beyond. A narrow passage extended to her left, and another rock wall was at her back. Etched into the rock were various pictographs and odd runes, inlaid with an red-orange polished stone. Pulsing bluish white light came from the passage to her left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Roxy followed the tunnel until she emerged to find Lara staring into a glowing ball of swirling and pulsing light, shifting across the color spectrum and roiling like boiling water. Directly between the entrance and the bubble was a short granite pillar with a black alabaster statue standing on it. The figurine was of a woman with unfurled bat wings and arms stretched out from her sides. Her hands pointed toward similar figurines one each side of her. Seven figurines were arranged in a ring around the pulsing bubble. Each column was placed in the center of a seven pointed star, formed of odd shaped runes inlaid in hematite.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara walked slowly to the nearest figurine, reached out, and set her hand on it. A bubble of red fog sprung up around the shimmering inner bubble and faint lines of red beamed between their hands. A second set of lines stretched from the tops of their heads to points of a seven pointed star inlaid in carnelian above the pulsing globe. Lara stared in wonder at the shimmering red fog. Slowly she reached out and touched it. It pulled away from her hand, leaving an oval openning she stepped through. She turned back to Roxy and asked, "You coming or staying?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Staying," Roxy answered, sitting down on the stone outside the red wall.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara stepped into the roiling energy bubble and stepped out into a small, bubble room, with a narrow passage directly in front of her. The walls were swirling green and black fog, solid to the touch, but neither warm, nor cold. The patterns were almost hypnotic, drawing her in, leaving her standing in place for what could have been seconds or years, she couldn't tell which.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finally she shook her head and broke free. Behind her was a shimmering distortion in the wall, where she had stepped through. Instead of returning, she walked down the narrow passage, which emerged into a large room with seven additional passages leading out of it. Six were the same narrow tubes that she had emerged from. The seventh was larger and went only a short way until it entered the side of another tunnel which stretched off to the left and right. In the center of the intersection was a faded seven pointed star. The purple point was directly in front of the short passage she had emerged from.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara walked to the tunnel and stared off into the distance of it. There was nothing in sight except empty tunnel stretching away. She walked to the wall across it and touched it. At first it felt solid, but as she moved her hand around it, feeling the texture, it softened and split open in an iris shaped opening. Stepping through, she found herself in a featureless fog of green and black. Just ahead of her was a set of seven descending passages, clustered in a circle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A brighter green glow emanated from the tube where the iris had closed behind her and a similar glow pulsed on the section of ground between the seven passages down. Her curiosity led her deeper into the fog. The green glows remained behind her, waiting to guide her back. A silent wind lifted and played in her hair. Like the walls, it neither warmed her nor chilled her. The further she ventured into the fog, the more at peace she felt, as if she had come home to a safe place. Stress dropped from her like a weight and she spun in place, arms outstretched, glorying in the utter relaxation, at last sinking to the soft ground and laying back to stare into the patterns of the fog.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly a nagging thought intruded into her peace, a sense she was forgetting something. It drifted closer, reminding her of Roxy left in a different place. Reluctantly she climbed to her feet and looked around, afraid she was lost. The green glows were beacons that led her back to the strange tunnel and the iris wall.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She emerged back into the cave, stepping out of the bubble and startling Roxy, where she was sitting on the floor. "How long was I gone?" Lara asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ten minutes, why?" Roxy was staring at Lara as she spoke. "What happened to you in there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean?" Lara asked, nervousness in her voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your eyes have green and black shadows flickering in the irises and your hair has green and black highlights. Do you feel any different?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I feel amazing, at peace, calm, for the first time I can remember. You've got to see what's there! It's incredible, a place between the worlds, a vast network of tunnels and passages to anywhere there is one of these energy things. They stretch across the multi-verse like an infinite web of pearls."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara grabbed her hand and pulled her boldly into the energy bubble. Roxy's startled scream was cut off as a moment of cold blackness led to stepping out into the tunnels Lara had seen. Roxy stared at the green fog, drifting and swirling, confused and at home, at the same time. She was startled by Lara's hissed, "What the fuck?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lara was staring at her. When she looked down, she could see why. Her camoflage had dropped and she was standing in all her natural glory. Leathery black wings arched up from her back. A prehensile tail sprouted from the base of her spine. Her thin and angluar frame had filled in just enough to make her stunningly attractive. Her clothes lay shredded at her feet. She hadn't noticed when the change destroyed them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, that is cool, really weird, and a bit disturbing. What just happened?" Lara asked, beginning to recover from her surprise.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, I, well, as you can see, I'm not exactly as I appear. I'd say there's no good way to explain, but there's no good way to explain this either. I am a succubus, from a long line of succubi. My mom wanted out of the politics of our home and brought us to your world just after I was born. We have to hide, for reasons that should be very clear to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah," Lara answered bitterly. "Many humans are fuck-tards when it comes to anything different."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* UPDATE: Roxy gows through gate with Lara */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Lara should be changed the first time she steps through the gate - Roxy should be there to witness it - the effect is as if a spastic puppetmaster were jerking her around - also, Roxy should vaguely see Ishra placing the spiderling on Lara just before the change starts, maybe hear her say, "Be healed and whole young voidling."</p>
