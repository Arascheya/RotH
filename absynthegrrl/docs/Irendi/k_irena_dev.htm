<p class="sectioncaption">Things to remember throughout</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyis is a bit conflicted - she liked being a surfer girl, hanging at the beach and only worrying about the next great wave. She also loves her job at the game company. Her liking of security and the damage to her leg make her want to keep developing, but whenever she surfs, she remembers how much she loved it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>


</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">Things to consider revising</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime, Nyis, Irena, and Sophia all knew each other at university. Refactor based on this. Sophia did not reveal why she was separated from her parents, didn't reveal the disowning, except to Irena when talking at Waverly's, so some of the current data can hold. Determine why she lived out in the cheap apartments - she went to Lefronica and came back withdrawn and haunted - what happened and what did it do to her and why did it distance her from her friends? Something damaged her trust and called into question her ability to read people - would have been in the effects business and with some of the personnel. CyCore snapped her up when she applied to them, so her tech cred came out improved by the ordeal - rufied, raped, and filmed by a perv who thought that because she was in a couple of pornos that she was fast and easy, he had seemed trustable to her and she was devastated by what he did and how he left her, naked, feet and hands bound, in a popular park, with a sign saying slut tied to her bound hands</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>


</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5"Nyis has surfing posters and game posters in her room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime takes Irena and Nyis to Wahaii to discuss Game Director duties. Irena will be part of the directorate, but not in a full-time or paid position. She will advise, discuss, test, and review, but keep her "day job" as owner/manager of Tom's empire.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyis always wanted to surf the Eku, even with the danger</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena wants her to teach her to surf. Nyis suggests MJ do the teaching. Nyis has a weird stance from her knee and hip problems and she is a goofy foot (right foot forward) surfer. MJ is a switch-foot (either foot forward) surfer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena and Nyis find the canned cultural events at the resorts to be unsettling and vaguely offensive, but don't realize why until talking to MJ. MJ was born to a Wahaiian mother and a huala father and explains why they feel uncomfortable - what if someone came to your town and had you perform something sacred to you as an entertainment?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyis will make it through Eku - does she get injured?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyis will start on the Kuawa north shore before heading back to the Oahu north shore for the pipeline</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MJ teaches Irena, who comes to like surfing, giving her something to do on future trips with Nyis</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They find the Gate under Bali Ha'i?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fun thing - if it fits - Someone that knew Nyis from her competition days sees her surfing Eku, or overhears part of her conversation with MJ. speculation starts that she is coming out of hiatus/retirement, but no one checks with her before starting a web/blog/surfing news rumor about it. Nyis hears through Mary that the rumor is up. Something like: "unconfirmed sources have heard Nyssa Zarev, once a rising star in the national circuit, talking about taking on the Banzai Pipeline. Others speculate she could be making a bid for the pipe masters competition, only recently opened to female competitors."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Need to determine how Nyis finds out about the rumors - does someone accost her in the hotel, her parents at their home, or MJ when she comes to see Nyis the next day?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MJ is staying with Nyis's parents while in Lanahua</p>

<p class="regtxt5">CONSIDER: MJ arranges an exhibition bout as part of the Wild Card segment of the Eku Masters. What she doesn't tell Nyis is she will give Nyis her spot if Nyis "wins" the exhibition.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Have pushed timeline for Wahaii trip - is it too abrupt or does it actually move the story forward?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyis always has a bit of sadness when she returns to the islands because of the ever increasing tourist feeding frenzy of hotels, resorts, and other crap catering to them. She misses the days before the big build-up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaikane - old male friend from Wahaii, He goes by Kai and is gay. It took Nyis and MJ to convince him to come out - he calls Nyssa Huala Woman, she calls him Wahaiian Freak. He is in the group at Royal Wahaiian because he is a surf instructor for the tourists</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jaime will expect Nyis and Irena to run the game dev - she still has security duties for Rani Corp. They can suggest another person or two if they need the added help keeping things on track.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MJ will tell Nyis Eku has become a true sausage-fest and getting a slot is not simple. Then offers the exhibition ride.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Example of <a href="http://www.roxy.com/surf-team-kassia-meador">Roxy Bio</a> for team - use as ideas for Gracie team bio</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MJ and KaiKune have seen or heard something about the Wet Caves on Kuawa that makes her curious - shortly before Nyis arrives. MJ could have seen more requests for dry suit rentals/purchases and noticed something odd about the "tourists" renting them, something non-standard</p>

<p class="regtxt5">figure 3 days for the Women's Eku Masters - Nyis would have to survive 3 days of rounds with a day between, based on surf conditions - men's pipe masters had 5 rounds, then semi, quarter, and final heats, rounds 1 - 3 had 11 heats, round 4 was 4 heats of 3 surfers to get to round 5 of 4 heats with finalists</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* place Rani Corp holdings near Lanahua airport as the staging area for the western hemisphere - Rani Corp should have branch offices inside the countries actively served - Rani Corp will need a Meriksas HQ or two - consider new one in Cagocha, in the CyCore building areas not in use by CyCore */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* is Wahaiian spoken on Wahaii any more? look up Hawaiian for ideas - yes, it is making a resurgence. Check out vids on learning it - Nyis, MJ, and Kai will speak it fluently */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Nyis, Jaime, and Irena were inseparable at university, clubbing, gaming, and moving through university life. Irena and Jaime got some of the same tattoos as a celebration of their closeness. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* look up Hawaiian traditional alcohol drinks - might have fermented coconut juice, otherwise like up kava/awa - also see what kinds of food places are near MJ's house */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* what is opposite of huala? - Kana'aimu (original Kama'aina) */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* are there traditional Hawaiian tattoo styles? Would they fit as inspiration for Nyissa's tats? have some examples, can get additional from google */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* are there hot pools in Hawaii? - maybe on the big island, none on Kauai */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* look up activities and information on Royal Hawaiian for flavor of what to do there. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* were Sophia or Jaime involved in the pornos with Irena and Nyis? - possible: Jaime, Nyis, Irena - the Girls of Goth magazine spread, Irena, Nyis, Sophia - pornos, both Casting Goth 5 and Lesbian Space Vampires - maybe Sophia had the connections and porn was one way she made money at university */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* open up Uru and get a few better shots of Nyssa's hair style and other interesting places, objects, etc. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider getting static grabs of the google maps street views of the various RotH locations, for the non-internet writing times - also grab various GEarth images for same use - verify current markers haven't drifted with updates of GEarth */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* try and find tribal black work examples similar to the chest patch on Jaime's photo - create a tattoos folder and add interesting ones to it, for use with other characters - such as rose and thorn examples for Kali and "belt" style ones to see if Kali really does want the wrap around snakes */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need to look at directories on the old system again and make sure desired items are moved to accessible locations, or pull hard drives and scan using the interface cables */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* refind location on Kuawa for MJ, surfing, etc. - see if MJ could live closer to the Dry Cave - move her to smaller house near Haena beach park */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Hawaiian airlines flies - 767-300ER planes - add a few to Rani fleet - smaller thn 747 in terms of decks, but range is good and take-off distance is reduced */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* airport data for Kauaii - 6500 ft length - 767-300ER could land/take off, but not at max takeoff weight </p>

<p class="regtxt5">CONSIDER: throttle back number of Maharaja Resorts in Wahaii - remove Turtle Beach and non-harem club one on Kuawa, maybe add one on Muai</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Do the women have any reason to go to Muai, Wahaii, or any of the other islands?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MISC: find de la mort face makeup and add to love's bitch entry for Kali, see if have goo Jewel costume image to use for Kali as well</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Polynesian Cultural Center clone- still church operated with minimal scholarly checking on data presented as fact. Wahaiians are split on whether it is an asset, because it tries to engage tourons in some heritage, or a detriment because it is basically a touron atracting money extractor</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Wihane (wahine) - woman - Wihane Holdings - Wahaiian company holding various assets under Wahaiian local management. MJ's father if chief coucil and Nyissa's Aunt is CEO - ADD to Companies and infill a bit more- hold Turtle Bay Resort as one of their properties, bought it from Rani Corp</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_surfing">Surf Terms</a> - make sure to use, especially MJ and Nyis</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Who "owns" Royal Hawaiian - hotel holding company, Starwood Hotels,  that holds many properties - use Sheraton and Luxury lines for Rani Corp holdings</p>

<p class="regtxt9"><a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/resorts/index.html">Luxury line</a> for special occassions and cash flow </p>

<p class="regtxt9"><a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton/index.html">Sheraton line</a> for general use by corp personel and for cash flow</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Where is Polanisian Cultural Center - east north shore of Ohua, church run, superficial according to MJ's mom - LDS runs it in this world - who runs it in alt. earth?</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="http://www.surfing-waves.com/surf_talk.htm">Additional surf terms</a> - expands on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_surfing">wikipedia page</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Add for MJ and Nyissa - attended Wahaiian Immersion schools - immersing them in Wahaiian language - they speak it fluently (also use in Surf Girls)</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Insertable Segments</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* conversation between Nyis and Irena about surfing - Nyis misses it and the simpler life she thinks she would have had. She is smart enough to know her thoughts are not realistic. */</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Scene: Nyis and Irena on balcony of Royal Wahaiian, after Irena watches Nyis surf - both in bikini bottoms and T-shirts - looking at the beauty of the sunset over the water */</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Scene: Irena watching Jaime and Nyis argue about how to make a dynamically modifiable theme-park game. MJ watches from another lounger. Finally Irena suggests the use Jaime's notes as initialconditions, then make the game a sandbox game, with some theme-park styled activities. Bring in staff running major power players to allow starting power players to influence gamer actions */</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Eku contest and exhibition */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">MJ nervously waited for the judges to score her run. She knew she hadn't done quite as well as Nyissa, but that wasn't what worried her. "Nyissa Zarev nine point seven, MJ Montoz nine point six. Nyissa Zarev advances to MJ Montoz position in the starting heats. Some amazing surfing by Montoz and Zarev to start this year's Women's Eku Masters Competition! Surfers in round one, heat one, please get ready," the announcer said, reading from the judges notes.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Nyissa strode over to MJ, flame flashing in the depths of her violet eyes. "What have you done? I said I didn't want to compete."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"You said you didn't want to take a slot from a newcomer. I am not a newcomer, so the best surfer should have my slot," MJ replied, her voice not quite shaking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Irena and Nyis - Irena giving Nyis a massage after a long day of surfing */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Nyissa lay face down on the bottom bunk. Irena took a moment to look at her friend, her eyes tracing the scars under the intricate black patterns of her right shoulder tattoo, then down to the scars under similar black tattoos on her right hip. She swung herself up and settled straddling Nyissa's butt, a massage position usually reserved for when they were informally dating. She dug into the familiar tightness in the shoulder, pressing and kneading well remembered places, while Nyissa moaned contentedly beneath her. The words from her moms drifted into her mind, subtly altering her motions. Nyissa gave a questioning sound.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Irena stopped rubbing, leaned down, and whispered in Nyissa's ear, "I want to ask you something. I hope you think it's something good." She raised up enough that Nyissa could roll over. Irena hesitated, lost in the brilliant violet eyes looking up at her.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Yes?" Nyissa prompted.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I was wondering if you'd like to be my partner. I know we agreed long ago to be friends, and just sometimes lovers, but I would like to try for more than that," Irena managed to get out.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Yes, oh gods, yes! I am so fucking sick of dating. I hate the scene, I hate the meat market part of it and I've never met anyone as wonderful as you!" Nyissa pulled Irena down for a searing kiss, then asked, "But don't you kind of like men, too?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Less and less. Sometimes I like a hard cock, but, and you'll love this, my moms said we should make more pornos when I want a man."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Gods, your right, that is so like your moms," Nyissa replied through her warm laughter.</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* another time while massaging Nyis */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">in response to something Nyis said: Irena leaned down, until she could whisper into Nyissa's ear, "I love massaging you. The way my pussy rubs against your glorious ass is a constant turn-on. Can you feel how wet I am? I imagine rolling you over, slipping off your underwear and fucking you until we soak the bed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Sophia's predicament - found after Eku */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Nyissa looked up from her computer, her face chalk white. "I know what happened to Sophia," she said in an empty voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"What?" Irena asked. Nyissa just motioned them over and pointed at the laptop screen. On it was a police report. Each of them quickly scanned through it, sorrow and rage building as they read how Sophia had been drugged, taken somewhere, raped, tied up and left naked in a park in the movie sections of Angelicanos. She had been wiped down and cleaned up so there would be no evidence to support her claim of who had raped her.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Shit," Jaime muttered quietly. She moved away, quietly stepping outside while Irena and MJ hugged Nyissa. She opened her phone, dialed a number, and spoke into it for a time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* restitution */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The black limo with the dark tinted windows sped through the Lanahua night. Inside a sleeping form sprawled on the back seat while Jaime and Sarah watched. "Any trouble?" Jaime asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"None. All I had to do was flash some cleavage and wiggle my ass a bit and it was a sealed deal. Bet he wasn't expecting to be the one drugged down," Sarah replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"You get the proof?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Of the drugs in my drink? Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The limo pulled onto a side street, running parallel to the vine covered mesh fence around the Rani staging complex. A hidden gate swung open just before they arrived at it. Within moments the limo was off the street and in the dark interior of a warehouse. Sarah motioned to two large, silent men and pointed at the sleeping figure. "Take him to the quiet rooms."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Famous actor and producer Steve Trantor woke on a hard bed. It was bolted to a wall of a tiny room, with a steel commode with a sink basin in the top. A large, bare bulb burned overhead, protected by a heavy mesh cage. "Good morning," a heavily modified voice said from the ceiling.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Where am I? Who are you? What do you want? I demand my phone call."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Feeling guilty? Do you think the police are holding you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I'm not talking without my lawyer."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"That's ok. You don't need to talk. You are here because you drugged and raped a fiend of mine. I am trying to decide if you will be found in a park, dead of an overdose, or if there might be a different fate for you."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I have..."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Before you bluster, consider, you have been drugged and taken to an unknown spot, without anyone noticing. Is this how you want to start your negotiations? Right now, you are proving how much of a waste of skin you really are. Take an hour to think on this."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Hey, you can't leave me," he shouted. The silence stretched on, unbroken.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">An hour later the voice spoke again, "Are you ready to begin negotiations?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"People will be missing me. It's only a matter of time until the feds join the search."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Really? You frequently disappear for long periods of time. I don't think we will need to worry. Now, first question, how many women have you drugged and raped?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I have never..."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Are you willing to take a polygraph test to verify your claims?" The silence stretched out until the voice spoke again, "I thought not. Do you have a compelling reason why I should let you live?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"If you kill me, won't that make you as bad as you say I am?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Poor try. Is the dog catcher evil because he puts down a rabid dog? You get two more."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I promise to not do it any more. I can change."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I doubt you will. The addiction of power is stronger than your consciousness. Again, rabid dog."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"What if I promise to turn myself in?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Tell me what you plan to confess to."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Drugging and raping a woman."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Only one? How many have you done over the years? How many casting couches, trailer liaisons, and promises of parts for sex?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Not all of those are illegal! You can't count them."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I'm sorry. I don't think I have made myself clear. We are not discussing legality. We are discussing ethics and decency. You use your position to degrade other people. This is not acceptable. You have one last chance to preserve yourself. Make your offer a good one."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Fine, I will confess to drugging and raping twelve women over the past three years. Does that satisfy your petty need for justice?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"It satisfies my need for restitution. It does not satisfy my desire to kill you. Remember, I will be watching. If you fail in any way to be prosecuted for these crimes, you will be found in that park." As the voice finished speaking, gas poured from vents in the ceiling, rendering him unconscious once more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* at MJ's house - after Restitution */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Nyissa and Irena were discussing character designs for Jakara, capitol city of the Lotus Empire, while sitting in MJ's front yard. MJ was cleaning and waxing her board, nearby. Jaime came out of the house, laptop in hand. "You are going to want to see this."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The others clustered around the screen as Jaime started a video clip. "Breaking news, movie favorite Steve Trantor stunned the world today when walked into the Angelicanos police department and confessed to drugging and raping twelve women over the past three years. He went on to detail the assaults, which the police are currently verifying. We will provide additional coverage as this story breaks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* surf exposition */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa and MJ were walking toward the water when the chant started. It started quietly, maybe one or two voices, faint and almost unintelligiable, but grew rapidly as other voices joined. "Scar, scar, scar," built to a swelling cadence. Nyissa turned to see where it was coming from and saw Ron French, standing at the head of a group of people she knew from high school. They were chanting at the top of their lungs and pumping the air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tears sprang up in her eyes as she gave the old salute of left fist on heart, then arm out to the crowd with her hand in the Hang Loose sign. The crowd saluted her back in unison and the chant rose in volume.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MJ called to her as they paddled out, "I wouldn't call that old news, would you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa answered with a shake of her head, tears tracking down her face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They chose who would take the first wave using rock, paper, scissors. MJ was first. Her run was impecable, controlled and perfect. She came out of the water grinning as she always did after a great run.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissa started her run with a tiny flutter of nerves at the size and intensity of her wave. Once she was up, her muscles took over. Her run was perfect Zarev form, flashy, showy, but with excellent control and preciosion. Irena and MJ watched wth pride from the beach as she spun, turned, darted up the wave face, kicked and spun, pulling every bit of energy from the immense wave. The run lasted twice as long as MJ's had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ron led the charge of her closest friends out into the water to snatch her off her board and hoist her to their shoulders. Another person grabbed her board and they bore her back to the shore as a conquering hero.</p>
