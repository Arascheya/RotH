<p class="pagecaption">Nyissana - New Game</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissana staggered into the office, coffee cup clutched in one hand. She dropped into her chair, leaned back and stared blank-eyed at her computer screen. After a few more sips of coffee, she leaned forward and logged in. Flashing on the screen was the meeting notice that had brought her in early. She rose with a muttered, "oh, right", and made her way through the cube farm to the conference room, coffee still tightly in hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nyis, Nyissa, hey Nyissana!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took the third call before she focused on the woman at the head of the table. "Jaime? What are you doing here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissana was on her feet moving toward the woman as she spoke. Jaimie grabbed her in a tight hug and said, "You'll see," in a mischievious voice. Nyissana walked back to her coffee and sat back down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bob, the CEO, walked in next. Once the last of the stragglers had entered, he began, "As you know we've been looking for a new concept to develop. We had several ideas but no funders. Ms. Solitaire has come to us from Rani Corporation with a property they want to develop. We don't have to take it, but they will pay all development costs and have guaranteed a generous profit stream for at least three years after launch. Ms. Solitaire, if you would be so kind."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Certainly Mr. Eveson. Rani Corp would like to hire your team to produce a new MMO for us. It is based on a property belonging to one of our employees. The game is based in a multi-verse containing magic and technology, ancient civilizations, and conflict between power groups. I could stand up here and talk for hours about the property, but it would be more effective to pass out the Non-Disclosure Agreements, then make the data available to you. Once you've had a few days to review it, I can return and see what was decided." She looked straight at Nyissana, "Nyis, you will recognize the material." She passed around a stack of forms, pretty much the standard non-disclosure boiler-plate text. Most of the employees signed them immediately, being used to the forms. Once all theforms were returned Jaime set a portable drive on the table. "Go ahead and load this onto a secure server and start your review. Bob will call me when you are ready with your answer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nyissana started back to her office, to be stopped by Jaime's call, "Nyis, got a couple of moments?"</p>
