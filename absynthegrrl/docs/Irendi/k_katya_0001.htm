<p class="regtxt5">Dear Sis,</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I'm here, in Hawaii, at the Harem Club. Remember how we tried to find out about it, but couldn't find anything? How we thought it had to be a sleaze pit and you were more worried than usual about it? Well, we were completely wrong. The Harem Club is an exclusive organization within the Maharaja Resort company. It is for the insanely rich who want a private strip club and entertainment package. The facility here, just outside Hilo, is posh beyond my imaginings. I have a private suite of rooms, a maid and personal assistant, free food, a car at my call, and the right to use the corporate jet if I want to visit the other islands.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I think you''d like Lailani Kalapa, the manager here. She's smart, beautiful, and takes shit from no one. Reminds me of you in that way. Tyana and I are settling in. I'll send you more later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Love,</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dear Sis,</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So, we are getting settled in. The new resident package provides quite a bit of detail about the resorts, the company, and mentions it as a wholy owned subsidiary of Rani Corp. I have just started looking up Rani Corp and fucking hell, what a conglomerate they are. It loooks like they have their hand in everything we take for granted, telecom, entertainment, and high technology. Anyway, I'd send you pictures, but resort policy forbids residents from sending out that kind of data. I'd be angry, but paying residents are bound by the same rules. One of the other dancers has seen a paying resident excorted out for breaking that rule.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We get discounts for family, if you want to come visit, room rates would be atround a hundred a night. After three months, the resort would subsidize your ticket, paying half. Seems weird to me that they can spend so lavishly on employees.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This place is crazy. There are two sections, the area for the Harem Club and then a family friendly area for other guests. Each side has the same arrangement of artificial pools, made to look like a section of river and natural pools, tropical plants, flowers, and water slides. Two of the resaurants, bars, and common areas. The screening is such that it would be very hard for someone under age to get into the club sections.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tomorrow Lani is taking a few of us to the local shops to pick up more "island wear" whatever that is. We end up paying half the cost from our salary. Speaking of that, I have never been paid this much. It's twice what I made during that gig with the sleazy men's club chain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anyway, Tyana's down at the pools and I promised her I'd join her once I'd updated you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Love,</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dear Sis,</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I am sorry to hear your friend has disappeared. Are there any clues? Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It sounds similar to something that happened just before Tyana and I flew out to Wahii. You remember the Top Hat Club in Waukie? The real shit-pit, hooker haven, sleaze pit? Well, the owners daughter Alexandra disappeared Haloween night. At first I was afraid she was molested and taken by one of the frat-brats that were all over the place, but her truck was found down in the Miller Field parking lot. There was no signofa struggle, only that she had hot-wired it rather than use the keys.</p>
