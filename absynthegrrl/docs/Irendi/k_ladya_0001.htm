<p class="pagecaption">Chapter 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dorotea Ayrthane woke slowly on a bed of autumn leaves. They crinkled and crackled as she rolled over and pushed herself to her feet.A faint breeze barely stirred the air around her. In front of her was a red granite monument, with a thick column candle burning in front of it. Behind her a grey mausoleum. Thick trees surrounded the clearing and late afternoon sun slanted in from her left, casting long shadows and bathing everything in golden light. The rest of the clearing contained a scattering of other graves and a partial skeleton, half buried in leaves and forest detritus.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dorotea spun in a circle, taking in the strange surrounding, trying to remember why she would be here. Her last memories were of the vault below Tharaneta with her niece, Nadya. Nadya had just pulled out the artifact of power they had been seeking when a wave of insanely powerful magic had slammed over them. She had blacked out and woke up in the clearing. She took stock of what she had with her, a small bag with a half full water skin and a little food. With a shrug she hoisted it back over her shoulder and started toward a narrow path out of the clearing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The path led to another clearing, with a narrow stone bridge crossing to another clearing with a tower in it. Twenty feet below the bridge was dark blue water ,smelling faintly of the ocean. The tower's single door was locked and its clearing was surrounded with more dense forest. Approaching the trees ,she tried to ease herself through them. Invisible barriers stopped her. The magic was thick enough she could feel it without needing to use any detection spells. Puzzled and frustrated, she followed as many paths as she could find. There was a clearing with burned out houses, another stone bridge, longer and straighter than the first one, and a clearing with a path that ended abruptly in dark brush.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She ended up back in front of the monument, with the slow realization that the sun had not moved in the hours she had been exploring. Settling her bag firmly on her shoulder, she began a teleport spell. It came easily, building to release, then rebounding in a searing flash of light and pain. In the haze she saw a bone throne, for just an instant, with a woman dressed in a drab green tunic sitting on it. Then she fell back into herself and the massive headache of a spell gone terribly wrong. She settled slowly to the ground near the monument to recover.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the pain faded, the memories drifted forward. They started happy, the days of childhood with her sister, Tonie. They were best friends and could have been twins except for the age difference. Soon they went darker, the days of the wizard wars, terrible wars, where everything was a weapon. Tonie and her were apprentices, so when the order came for her to go research an especially powerful artifact, she could not refuse. Their home city was destroyed while she was away. Attacks came where she was and left her half dead in the ruins of the library where she had been.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spells knit her back together.Emerging from the rubble, she found she was the highest ranking wizard left. The few survivors turned to her for answers. More survivors emerged as the original band searched the shattered city. Then came the rebuilding. With each challenge Dorotea had to become harder, making difficult choices, including when magic would not be enough to save a critically injured child.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As prosperity slowly returned, so did the squabbles. Priests whipped their various flocks into frenzies of recruiting and interference. After two short years the conflicts were so bad that rebuilding and food production were stalled. Talking with them went nowhere since wizards were abomination to the religious. Frenzy based attacks against her coordinators and others in the new council increased with each new sermon. Frustrated, she asked the high priests to meet with her over dinner. The squabbling only started after they had consumed enormous amounts of her food and wines. It took a long time to quiet them so she could speak, "I called you here to try once more to reach a temporary truce. We need to get the food grown, we need to finish the rebuilding, with more survivors trickling in, we need places for them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"All this will occur once you relinquish your control. It is intolerable that your kind remain in charge. You brought the downfall, you brought the death. Only through renewed beliefs can we survive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Untrue. Prosperity is slowly returning, the city is becoming, and the people are well-fed and happy. Religion is not necessary for basic human happiness. I am unwilling to let your council of squabblers lose what we have started."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then you will get no help from us," the one who had chosen to speak replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her head dropped into her hands, as she sat in front of the monument, memories more real than her surroundings. She had remained seated, quietly staring at the gathered priests. Tears dripped into her hands as the memories leapt forward. She had given the complicated hand sign and three crossbow bolts suddenly appeared in the left eye sockets of the three most vocal opponents. Trusted servants hurried forward, grabbed the victims and held them in place in their chairs. "Here is a new proclamation. I will kill the high priest of any religion who seeks to oppose my plans for rebuilding. Move against me and I will kill every high priest in the city," Her eyes were sad, but her voice was steady as she continued, "Furthermore, this policy will remain until one of three things occurs. The city and surroundings are once again prosperous, there are no more priests to kill, or you manage to take me down. Be warned, there are final strike protocols in place. Killing me will not result in happiness for anyone." Sixteen more priests had died in strange an horrible ways before they relented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Regret pulled at her, not for the dead priests, but for not investigating rumors that there were survivors in the wreckage of her home city. News of her sister's death was her first realization that Tonie had survived the war. She had been killed in a fight with one of the new wizard lords, one from a lesser city. Lord Shalmar had quickly moved in to take the city and fill the void of power. It wasn't until much later that she heard that Tonie had a daughter, still alive, and scavenging in the ruins of the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Then came the news that Shalmar had found reference to the artifact Tonie had been researching. What little information remained had shown that it was the cause of the devastation of the city. The matron had attempted to use it as a last effort to survive. The thought of it in the hands of Shalmar had driven her to the wreckage, introduced her to her niece, Nadya, and left her in this strange place. The last she had seen of Nadya, she was holding the artifact aloft as blinding white light flared around her.</p>
