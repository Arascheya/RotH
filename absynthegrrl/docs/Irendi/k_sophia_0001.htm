<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - First Awakening</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia awoke suddenly, uncertain whether she had heard a deep gong sound or felt a low rumble. Her left hand fumbled for her bedside lamp as her mind tried to understand why she was seeing moonlight patterns on curtains. Her hand passed through the empty space and hit the end of the bed. She jerked up and stared around her, taking in the moonlight streaming in through ornate lattice windows, the delicate scent of flowers, and the sound of a fountain drifting on a puff of breeze. The bed was three times larger than the one in her apartment and far more comfortable. Her gaze moved faster and faster as she found nothing familiar in the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The room was large, with a high, domed ceiling. Beautiful tile work covered the walls and perfectly fitted stone and plaster work created the dome. A high arched doorway opened into a space beyond. Delicate bronze lattices covered two large windows and moonlight painted patterns on the tiled floor, scattered carpets, and cushions. A black leather corset, velvet half jacket, and long black skirt were draped on the far side of the bed. They looked like the outfit she had worn to work the previous day. Gauzy white curtains were pulled back from the four sides of the bed, suspended from elegantly carved, thin wooden posts and cross pieces.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fear built to terror and pulled a shout from her, "Hello?!? Who's there? What is going on!?!" Only the sound of the fountain greeted the silence at the end of her shout. Anger started to filter in over the terror, "What do you want? Where are you?" Trying to ride the anger she leapt out of the bed and nervously prowled around the room. A large, dark wardrobe was placed in the corner to the right of the arched doorway. Inside were several outfits ranging from modest to overly revealing. A dome lidded chest crouched at the foot of the bed and held undergarments, also ranging from modest to outright slut wear. She found nothing that would tell her where she was or how she had gotten here. Slowly she returned to the bed, sat facing the door, and stared into the darkness of the space beyond. Slowly the adrenaline faded and, in spite of herself, she drifted into sleep, falling back into the bed in an awkward and twisted position.</p>

<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Second Awakening</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sunlight and the sound of birds woke her. Stiff muscles screamed in protest as she moved from the twisted position she had landed in. A need to relieve herself got her fully to her feet and headed to the archway. Beyond, a worn stone stairway descended to her left, revealed by the sunlight from a high skylight. Across the way a small room held a sink and toilet. She stepped onto the landing and felt a faint tingle pass over her. She felt the same tingle again when she entered the far room. Once she was finished, she returned to the bed chamber, stopping and moving slowly through the archways. The tingles happened in the exact center of the openings. If she moved really slowly she could almost see a hint of empty blackness right at the tingle point.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fear, anger, and curiosity warred as she slowly walked back to the bed and her clothes. She grabbed them to start dressing, stopping when a dark leather bound book and a small ivory carving dropped onto the bed. Once she was dressed she sat back on the bed and examined the items next to her. The ivory item was carved to look like an oddly shaped key with the blade shaped in a simple fashion as if for a very old lock. A short, sharp needle stuck out from the end of the blade and the top of the key was worked into a perfect miniature skull, with rubies set into the eye sockets. "What the hell?" she whispered as she reached out to pick it up and froze when her hand touched it, locked rigid as a cascade of energy and imagery slammed over her. For a few seconds her awareness almost kept up with the onslaught, then, finally overloaded, she fell into blackness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Tyana</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She awoke much later to find herself face down on the bed where she had fallen. The key was nowhere to be found. She started to panic until it rose out of the flesh of her left hand. Then she panicked for real, holding her hand away from herself and watching the key melt back into it. "What the FUCK!?!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A faint, ghostly shape faded into view several feet in front of her. "Easy, mistress. It means you no harm," the figure said in a quiet, low soprano voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia backed slowly away, coming to rest with her back against the lattice of the nearest window. "What...what is going on? Who are you? Where am I?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Easy, mistress," the voice said again. "You are in no danger. I am Tatyana Zerina Merilen Cheryenko Petrovka, Tyana to my friends, and I certainly hope we can be friends! I am the Hut, well, the master control system that runs the technology of the Hut at least. The key has activated, now you and I and the Hut are joined. I am here to help you, although you should lower your heart rate. It's really not good for it to race like that." Slowly the ghost faded into solidity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The room spun in front of Sophia, her vision closed down to a narrow, dark tunnel, and she would have fallen if Tyana hadn't caught her, helped her to the bed, and eased her down on it. "Maybe I should come back later?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No," Sophia replied slowly. "Just give me a chance to breath." Her eyes slipped shut and she drew in long, slow breaths until the darkness began to fade. "I get panic attacks," she said uneasily.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Perhaps, as time goes by, I can help you with that." The bed settled slightly as another body settled onto it. Sophia slowly opened her eyes once the darkness had receded. Above her, warm brown eyes in a round face, stared down at her. "Are you better now? I didn't mean to scare you, it's just most...it's just I didn't expect you to be so frightened. Aren't you used to magic or technology?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Things don't disappear into people's hands. Holograms don't become solid, shit, hologram projections like you don't even exist where I'm from. And magic is parlor tricks performed by sleight of hand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No arcane magic users? I'm very sorry. Your realm sounds very backward indeed. But no matter, you are here now, where magic and technology have evolved to a very high art." Tyana motioned around the room. "You'd never guess this was stabilized energy in a pocket dimension, would you? And it is for you, a gift from Irena."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An icy chill stole over Sophia as the words sank in through her panic. "What is going on here? Where am I? What do you mean by a hut? How did you get me here, drug me in the cab home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Sister of Balance herself selected you to fulfil a great destiny. She gave you this gift, brought you here, and asked me to help you understand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Send me back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Haven't you read the book yet?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, the key was freaky enough. I'm just a community relations manager at a game company. There's no money to ransom me, and none to pay it if there were."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ransom? You don't understand. You aren't a hostage here. This is yours, to use as you will, well it will be once you fix it. There were, um, complications during the transfer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You trapped me here deliberately?!?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not deliberately! Just as we shifted you here, there was a ripple in time and space, caused by one of the power groups. We don't know which one, just that it damaged the Hut as we placed you in it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What the fuck did you do and what gave you any fucking right to do it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I told Irena it was a bad idea, I really did, but she said there was no time. We had to live with the dangers of cold recruitment, in the hopes enough would understand fast enough. I know it will make no difference, but I am sorry you were brought here this way. If we had time, we would have done this differently."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fuck!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tyana's eyes lost focus for a few moments. "Mistress, I have a status report ready for you, ah, wait, there is an intruder, that shouldn't have been possible."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Intruder, what do you mean intruder?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something slipped through during the instancing, or from the energy spikes. I have it contained in the Memorial."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Memorial?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, a place of memory, of those known by the denizens of the Hut. The intruder will be safe there. I will see to its needs. I recommend you wait until you understand things more clearly before you confront it. Would you like me to display the short summary or the full status report? And would you like it here or in the control center?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh?" Sophia swung her eyes around the room, looking for a display, "Summary and here, I guess, if you could show me the terminal?" Tyana made a small motion and a glowing screen shimmered into focus in front of Sophia. She almost shrieked in surprise, but caught it at the last minute.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is the summary, mistress."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you tell me what this all means in a non-technical summary?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Normally the auto-repair systems can handle most any failures in the Hut. There are a few things that are required for the auto-repair to work, though. One of those items is a complete set of control crystals. One or more are damaged, so auto-repair cannot work. You will need to find replacements before the Hut will be able to fix itself. I hope replacements are available where we are, otherwise, I am not sure what we do next."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do I know what to look for?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Check the diagnostic terminal in the Core Systems and then a physical examination of the various units should give you an idea. After that, you need to find out what sort of world we are in and where to look for crystals. I'd also recommend reading through the book. Irena went to the trouble of writing it up. It might actually help. I must concentrate on what auto-repairs I can make," Tyana began to fade.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What if I have more questions?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talk to the Hut and I will answer."</p>

<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Explanations 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her hand hovered over the book, wanting to pick it up, but annoyed by it as well. She gave a sharp laugh and opened it to reveal a neat, looping hand, in dark purple ink, filling the first pages.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Greetings traveler.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You are likely wondering where you are and how you got here. You have been carefully selected because you have shown intelligence, curiosity, and ability in your daily life. You have been brought here by means both magical and technological to take part in maintaining the Balance in the Multi-Verse. I am sorry, however, the only way to return to your point of origin is by your own discovery of its location.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I wish I had time to give you all the information you will need for this task, however, the knowledge would fill a library and take life times to impart. Such a library is one of the many rooms available to you inside this magical construct which will be your home. This construct is large, comprising over 70 rooms, although some are merely connecting items. But I digress. To save you a bit of confusion, there are only four truly important areas. These are the Library, the Throne Room, the Core Systems, and the Interface.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You may reach the Library by descending the stairway to your courtyard and taking the first door on your right. When you enter the library, ask Kyira, the librarian, for the suggested first volumes. There are five of them, titled as follows: Magical Theory; Gate Theory; Gods, Goddesses, and the rest; Hut Concepts; and A Quick History of the World. They are not nearly enough to tell you all that is happening, but they will give you a fighting chance at knowing what to ask. The realms are vast and we are but one among the multitudes. It is not possible to be all places at all times. The slice of the realms you experience will be different than the ones I have seen. Take heart that your contributions will always effect those around you and may change the very fabric of the realms you touch.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Kyira has agreed to stay in the Hut to assist you in finding other volumes that might be of assistance. I would take it as a great kindness if you treat her with respect. If you do not, she is under no obligation to remain and you will need to find items in the library for yourself, rather than being able to ask her for them.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Throne Room is the main control center for this construct. From here you may connect the Hut to the areas needing your attention. These areas may be anywhere and anywhen in space and time. The recommended reading list will give you some idea about what this means. This room is accessed by descending your stairwell to the first landing, entering the sitting room, and taking the door to your left.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Core Systems are accessed through a hidden door behind the rear head to the right of your throne. This is the heart of the Hut, providing the ability to connect to any realm in time and space and providing the power required to keep the Hut alive.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Interface is the exit to the Real-Space Realms and is the only way in or out of the Hut. The door at the end of the Throne Room leads to the interface room.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You should have found a key with this notebook. This Master Key will grant you access to everything within this construct and the ability to reconfigure it as you desire. The key has many features to help you figure out its various functions and uses.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Once again, I apologize for not being able to provide you with more assistance in this initial transition, however, events are unfolding far more quickly than I expected and I must rush to meet them. The last advice I can give is watch everything and pay attention to anything you hear. Sometimes the smallest statement carries the biggest impact. Good luck and be careful.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Irena</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stared at the book, then flung it down on the bed. "Like that's supposed to help?" she yelled. "Thanks so very much!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know where the library is and that you have a librarian to talk to as well. It wasn't totally useless," Tyana's voice answered from the air around her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But it didn't tell me who Irena is or what I'm wanted for. What does she want? And how can she expect me to help her after she has kidnapped me? What if I say no?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is your choice, of course. Truly, Irena wishes she could have written more, but there really was no time. She felt that spoon feeding you information would not be fair, it wouldn't prepare you for times when you would know more about a situation than she would and then you would have to act for yourself. Still, I shouldn't tell you more, but I am here and she is not. There is a war on, not the usual kind with two groups of beings lined up to fight each other. This war is a battle between the hard polarities of the multi-verse, between law and chaos, order and anarchy, freedom and oppression, between all the opposites that balance to produce the multi-verse. Forget what you may have been taught by a religion or even a secular teacher, if any polarity wins this war, the multi-verse will collapse. Every polarity has myths about the Old Ones, the two that were at the begining. These two are sought by every faction and their release will unmake everything. Only with the balancing of all these oppositions can life exist, let alone thrive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And this means what for me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We need your help in restoring the balance between these polarities. It means going out into the various worlds of the multi-verse and opposing any strong polarity. You should pull down systems of order where they are destroying free action, add stability to chaos, add order where anarchy prevails. In short, try to shift any out of balance system toward a more neutral, centered position. It won't be easy to determine and it will be harder to accomplish, but I do not exaggerate when I tell you the fate of many depends on you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh please, you expect me to believe any of this?" Sophia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What was the focus of the 'game' you were writing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, maintain..the....balance......save......Oh Fuck."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you find it so hard to believe when it becomes real?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was a game, writen and acted in by those of us that hated the dominant religions of our time. While I am heartened to find the multi-verse is not controlled by a bad father figure version of a god, I am not qualified to do this. I put in my hours, collect my pay, watch the game go live, and keep the actors pointing the players at the goals. I hate being a Player Character. I really prefer to create the scenarios."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And life happens when we are making other plans." Tyana faded back into view. "Outside this construct, this Hut, connects a world that is not your own. Walk among its populace and observe. See what is happening and decide if you can help. At the very least, you need to know this Hut is damaged. You will have to find a way to repair it if you want to return to your home. Kyira and I will help you as much as we can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, library first then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would recommend it. Talk to Kyira, look over the reading list, then decide what your first step will be."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Library</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia slowly pushed herself off the bed, stood on still rubbery legs, and inched over to the nearest window. She stood, staring into the courtyard, until she felt like she could walk without falling. She took the stairs one at a time and slowly, noting the arched opening to the sitting room. The second landing ended at a short hallway leading to the courtyard. The scents of rich earth, flowers, and greenery greeted her. The late sunshine was warm on her face. 'No way,' she thought to herself, 'This can't be some constructed thing, it has to be real.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The courtyard was narrow and long, sandwiched between the walls of the rooms around it. Two four foot wide by fifteen feet long flower beds stretched down the center of it and a small fountain splashed into a pool between them. At the end opposite her a bench sat, sheltered under an overhanging balcony, and facing the flowers. Two doors led out of the long wall to her right, a single passage continued behind the bench, and another door opened in the ivy covered long wall to the left of the bench.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The heavy wooden door, in the first doorway, opened with the squeal of long unused hinges. Beyond the door was a narrow wooden stairway over a yawning black void. It rose to meet a small stone chamber, seeming to float in the vast darkness. Other wooden stairwells rose and descended from the stone chamber to other floating stone chambers, as far as she could see in the light from the door behind her and spilling from the various floating rooms. Terror constricted her chest, driving her back into the sunlight. She collapsed onto the paving by the nearest garden bed and sat, head in her hands, shaking and breathing with great difficulty.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Within seconds the attack passed, leaving Sophia surprised but pleased. Rather than return to the door right away, she walked along the paved sections of the courtyard, listening to the fountain and soaking in the warm light. The peace of the place calmed her, but there was a hint of nervousness underneath, brought on by the loneliness of the place.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly she returned to the open door. Focusing her attention on the lighted doorway at the top of the stairs she hurried up the narrow flight. Vertigo pulled at the edges of her mind as she stumbled into the small chamber. A flickering oil lamp sat in the center of a rough wooden table, casting dancing shadows around the six sided room. A small wrought iron stool was pulled up to the table and a closed book, bound in a light tan leather, rested next to the lamp. Hanging from the center of the ceiling was a large bronze bell, dark with age and soot. A  small mallet hung next to it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She reached for a book in one of the niches and her hand passed right through it. The same thing happened with every shelf and book except for one. A small green volume came back from the last shelf she tried. Flipping it open she read a short, hand written passage.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Akhalt</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Devil cursed and demon haunted Akhalt, center of the Galhai Wastes, where power mad sorcerers of yore called down to this earthly sphere a demon from beyond, to their unending sorrow... Akhalt, where the Undying One rules from the Glowing Throne to this very day... doomed, cursed Akhalt, which the very gods spurned, transforming all the realm around it into a burning waste...</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Akhalt, where Tesch Mar and Nyigroth battled for the Star Stones, greatest of the Ancient Magics. Desolation is all that remains and the Star Stones are scattered to the winds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She set the book back on a different shelf than it had come from and turned to the book already on the table. She had just flipped it open when a woman stalked in from one of the entries. "The least you could do is put it back on the right shelf," she said. Sophia jerked her head up in surprise and stared at the person in front of her. She was tall, almost six feet, with curly blood red hair on top of the most beautiful face Sophia had ever seen. Two strips of cloth dropped from her shoulders, barely covering her breasts, and fanned out to circle her waist. A small section continued down to mask her crotch while revealing most of her thighs. What caught and held her attention though, were the large, black, bat-like wings folded neatly against her back and the long, twitching tail just brushing the floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...I'm sorry..." Sophia stammered, jumping up from the table and backing to the offending shelf. She grabbed the book and held it out to the woman with shaking hands. "Where...where does it go?" she asked timidly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The woman gently took the book, turned, giving Sophia a clear view of just how little the cloth covered, and placed the book on the original shelf. "Right here. If you are ever in doubt, place the books on one of these shelves. They will reshelve themselves from there." She pointed to a small niche next to each of the doors. "I am Kyira, the librarian. And you are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sophia...Nelson."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome to the Hut and to the library. If you need anything, ring the bell and I will come and assist you." Kyira turned to go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you...could you find a few volumes for me? A note from Irena said I should ask you for....for...oh, what were they again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok, I think I know the ones you mean." Kyira slowly reached up toward the ceiling. Sophia stared, mesmerized, at the way the cloth moved up Kyira's body. When Kyira lowered her hands they held five books. "Liking what you are seeing?" she asked, with a wicked smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia turned bright red, stared down at the table, and mumbled, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That wasn't the question. Not just into boys, are you?" Sophia mumbled something. "What was that? I didn't quite hear you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I find both boys and girls attractive," Sophia said to the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, I'm so ugly you can't look at me?" Kyira teased.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, that's not why. I shouldn't stare, it's not polite."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe not where you come from. However, I find it a compliment, so stop cowering." She set the books down in front of Sophia. "These should get you started."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can you tell me about Irena?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who she is, what she wants, why I'm here, what I'm supposed to do, where I am?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. That's for you to discover, sorry. Oh, and the Short History book, that only applies to one of the worlds, possibly the one the Hut originated from. Irena never said. And the diary on the table is from the previous owner, the one who gifted it to Irena. It's an interesting read, although it won't tell you much about your situation," she paused for a long while, then pulled a second stool up to the table and lowered herself onto it. "Look, there are things you need to know. Irena would have you try and discover them on your own, I guess it's a god-thing, or something. If you come from a place that is aware of the multi-verse, gods, demons, and all the rest, then you can pick all this up quickly. But your world views most of this as either belief or fiction, am I right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, science has started to postulate a multi-dimensional space based on some kind of string theory, but, yes, mostly this is pleasant fiction to pass the time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As you can see, that model is incorrect. I don't know the theory behind this, but the multi-verse consists of everything and everywhere that has ever been imagined, and some things that haven't. Lesser gods, brought into being by the power of their worshippers, can control limited areas, for a while. The Greater Powers, the Three Sisters, are the greatest powers in the multi-verse and could control it all if they wanted. They find things work better with a hands off approach, only getting involved when something seriouosly threatens to unmake everything. Irena is one of the Sisters, which is why she rarely provides direct answers. Free will and random events are the greatest forces in the multi-verse. Attempts to force order or chaos unbalance things and need to be moderated, but that part I'm sure Tyana has told you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">""She mentioned that, yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Contact with this construct, this hut, changes you. Not just through seeing it, but the way it was formed and who it is connected to. I started as what you see, a succubus of the Abyss, but this place let me be more. Before this I had to feed on male mortals at least once a week to sustain myself. Here I am sustained by the construct and can turn all of my attantion to learning and other persuits. Everyone touched by this place takes away something and those that are bound to it become near to gods themselves."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The color drained from Sophia's face as she asked, "What do you mean, near to gods themselves?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kyira reached across the table and took Sophia's hands in her own. "You have become imortal, for starters. You will be able to feel pain, enough damage to kill you will send you back to your hut, but nothing short of the annihilation of the master hut can kill you. Actions you take, in whichever realm you are in, will have a magnified effect. That is the blessing or curse of being a keeper of the balance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This sounded wonderful when we were creating a game about it. The no death part works great in a game where players take poorly to permanent death for their characters, but in real life, how does anyone survive imortality and stay sane? And living with that kind of power, that's just not right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Isn't it? Why not? Surely there are power differences where you come from. Are they 'right' or 'wrong' too?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But this much power? This is insane!" Sophia pulled her hands back and dropped her head into them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kyira rose, slipped around the table, and rested her hands on Sophia's back, kneeding gently at the knots she found. "Your world has the power to destroy itself and certain leaders have the keys to that power. This is no different. Having power is easy, and is part of the way things are. Knowing what to do with that power, that's the hard part. Is it fair? Maybe not, but, as Irena says, the universe is, we are, deal with it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Deal with it? Wonderful fucking advice," Sophia snarled through her hands.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sometimes it's all there is. The universe keeps going regardless of how we see things."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But why me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I saw your information. You question everything and rant about the craziness of the way your world worked in the silence of your room. Dark poetry clutters up your data device and rattles around in your brain. Why not you? You have the chance to see and be more than you could have imagined a week ago." Kyira continued massaging Sophia's back for long minutes, finally asking, "You going to be alright?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I think so," Sophia answered. Her stomach cramped and rumbled as she reached for the first book. "Do you know where I could find food? I haven't eaten in quite a while."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was afraid that noise meant the Hut was falling apart around us. Go back to your courtyard and turn to the right from the library door, toward the overhang and bench. When you reach that area, take the passageway to your left. That takes you to the Main Stairs. Go down to the floor and take the door just to the left of the single staircase. This takes you to the dining alcove. The other door in the alcove takes you to the kitchen. Any other questions before I go?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why can't I touch many of the books in these shelves?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not certain. You can always ask me to find anything you need if you don't find it on your own. Do you need something in addition to these volumes? Or, if you want me to reach again, all you have to do is ask. The bell will let me know if you need something when I'm not right here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not right now, just curious, that's all," Sophia replied, eyes back on the table. She rose, still not really looking toward Kyira, and started for the door to her courtyard. "I've got to eat. I'll read through these later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, they'll be here for you."</p>

<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Kitchen</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia managed to get across the stairs over the open place by once again focusing on the far doorways. She breathed a large sigh of relief when she passed through the door back into her courtyard. The Main Stairs were light and airy, windows at every landing let in bright sunlight and warm breezes.   Byond the door was a small room with large bay windows overlooking a formal garden</p>

<p class="regtxt5"> The dining alcove held a small table, with place settings for two, set in a large bay window overlooking a beautiful formal garden. A purple cloth bound book sat on the table with a quill pen and bottle of red ink resting next to it. She looked at it for a few moments, then entered the kitchen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The kitchen was enormous with a large wood burning stove crouched in front of one wall, throwing heat out in great waves. Large wooden block tables held large knives, earthen bowls, and other kitchen tools. Along the far wall a marble counter contained three deep basin sinks and drain grooves for the dish racks on one end. Various cabinets and counters filled the rest of the space. She wandered around the space, opening cabinets, peering in drawers and into the ovens. A large cooler provided a wedge of cheese, the sink a tall mug of water, and one of the ovens a fresh loaf of bread.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Food and drink in hand she returned to the dining alcove and settled in. For a while she ate and looked out at the garden. When the food was gone, she slowly picked up the <a href="musings.htm">book</a> and flipped it open. There were sections written in seven different hands on the first few pages.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Tyana 2</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly she set the book back down on the table. "Tyana?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes mistress?" Tyana's voice answered from the air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where is the rest of the crew?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The rest of the crew? You are the crew, mistress. Kyira and I are here to assist you. There are no others."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then what's this?" Irena asked, waving the book in the air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"An echo...um, nothing mistress, just a book."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"An echo? Tyana, what is going on?" Sophia paused for a long moment, thinking of other similarities between her project and this place. "Unless... Are you doing what we did, creating instances of this construct, based off a master version, and giving them to random people? It was the only way we could figure out for working a magical device into our game." Tyans faded into view and just smiled. "You aren't supposed to answer questions like that, are you?" Tyana just continued to smile. "We created a way to meet the master version and crew, did Irena do that as well?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tyana waited for a few moments once Sophia stopped speaking, before asking, "Was there anything else, mistress?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you alowed to tell me the best way from here to the throne room?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, mistress. Return to the kitchen, walk to the door on the far well and furthest to your left, cross through the formal dining room, exit through the single door on the far side of the room, and you will be in the throne room. Since you will ask anyway, the door to your left, as you enter the throne room, will take you to the interface room and the exit to the current realm."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Throne Room</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The directions were simple, but they didn't prepare her for what she saw when she pulled open the door. The far wall was seventy feet away. To her left the massive hall extended another fifty feet, to the right it extended almost two hundred feet to a raised dais, supporting a large throne, crafted from enormous bones, and illuminated by a single shaft of light from above. Raising her eyes she saw a spiral galaxy swirling high overhead, where the ceiling should have been. The walls were black obsidian with veins of golden light shimmering from them. Tall, graceful columns of the same material reached to where the ceiling should have been. The floor was pink granite with etched black runes swirling and eddying about.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her footsteps echoed in the cavernous hall as she started walking, then running, toward the throne. Caution tried to pull her to a stop, but the need to be in the throne won out. Warmth and comfort enfolded her as she settled onto the cushion resting in the hollow of bone forming the seat. Images crashed into her head, faster and faster, twisting and roiling like an angry sea. For long moments she tried to cling to them, make sense of the currents. As they overwhelmed her she fought against them, pushing and twisting, trying to claw free of the pounding intensity of them. Blackness closed in around the edges of her vision and Tyana's voice whispered softly, "Let go. Let it happen. Become one with us and find peace." She fought to relax, to give in to the sucking blackness, but her mind fought to hang on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One scene flashed by, clear and complete. The view was from the throne, looking down on a blonde haired, boyish looking man. His face was pouty and spoiled looking, wearing a pleasant but almost gloating smile. He was dressed in rich, gaudy black clothes trimmed with orange. Four men in black armor with orange trim flanked him. "Mistress of the Hut, I would ask you to grant me the knowledge of the shifting magic you use to move this hut. In return I shall grant you several Ancient Magic items I have in my possession."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A name flashed into her mind, Aztol, followed by various incidents of horrific deeds perpetrated by him. After a pause she spoke, "Upstart, what makes you think I would wish your tech? You seek knowledge beyond your wisdom, power beyond your ability. I shall not grant you anything. Take your rag-tag bunch of misfits and leave. Seek not to bother me again, for that day shall be your last."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His composed face twisted into a mask of rage. "You think you are so powerful. I will crush you like the insignificant fool you are. Soon the very demons of hell will tremble before me. You will beg me for mercy but it will be too late." His wild violet eyes stared into Sophia's calm ones as he spit and twitched with rage. "Doom shall fall upon you and I shall be its instrument." He turned and stalked from the room as the image faded and Sophia slid into unconsciousness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Throne Room 2</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A deep gong pulled Sophia slowly awake. A strange bluish-green glow flickered against her eye-lids and a feeling of enfolding warmth and comfort held her securely. The bones of the massive throne were warm and pulsing slightly to the deep, steady heartbeat Sophia could feel more than hear. Her eyes opened to see a translucent image floating in front of her. Written on it were clusters of strange symbols that slowly twisted and morphed into words. "Summoning Gem AE3_666_01 activated. Coordinates transmitted. Jump system inactive. Data: Save/Purge"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do I get more detail?" A second window faded into view with more text and an image of two women in the early morning light with a heart shaped sapphire gem held into a shaft of sunlight. She stared at the image of two familiar faces before shouting, "Irena? Nyissa? Can you hear me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry mistress, the summoning gems aren't communications devices. If everything was working, we could jump to them. But that isn't possible until the hut is fixed. I would recommend saving their location," Tyana commented as she faded into view , standing to the side of the glowing windows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What if they change location?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then we hope they use the gem again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is our current status?" Sophia asked. Instantly half a dozen screens popped up in the air in front of her with status for various sections of the hut. Many were green, however, the ones dealing with main power and jump systems were red. In each one power and control crystals were marked as damaged. "What do these crystals look like?" Another screen opened with images of seven crystals, each a different color, displayed inside. Three, a blue, a dusty rose, and a scarlet shot through with blue had red circles around them. Underneath, they were marked as "damaged, non-functional". "What size are they" Immediately a three dimensional image of a crystal appeared, rotating near Sophia's right hand. The crystal was about the size of a closed fist, egg-shaped, with seven flat pads polished into it. "And there are no spares inside the hut?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No mistress," Tyana replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They can't be natural with those polished points, can they?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, they were created by technology and were originally designed for hyperdrive systems. The creator of the hut based the power systems on a similar unit. In some places they are very common, in others, almost impossible to find."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is outside the hut? Can you tell me that? Do you think we are in a place where I can find these easily?" Another widow opened, larger than the others, showing a narrow dusty street between low mud brick buildings. Bright sun smote the air from directly overhead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mistress, we are configured so you may survive the world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?" Sophia asked, distracted by the view.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The hut has automatically configured us to be synchronized with local atmosphere, temperature ranges, and disease vectors. You may step into the world without fear of unexpected effects."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can this be done for anywhere?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Theory says yes. There are places where none have tested it. I recommend selecting protective gear and weapons from your wardrobe before exiting the hut," Tyana replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Weapons? What am I going to do with weapons? I've never fought in my life!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am afraid you will need to learn, mistress. Most of the multi-verse is rather hostile, particularly to strangers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, and where am I supposed to learn? Can you teach me? Do I have to worry about survival in here with the power systems messed up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I can teach you some things. We have as long as it takes. There is no serious risk with the systems as they are. I will join you in your rooms, you can select weapons, and we can begin. You realize, I hope, that this will take a while. These skills aren't learned overnight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Figures. Wait, what about the intruder? Could it hurt me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When you are in the hut, no."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can you show me the intruder?" A new window opened showing a woman with dark red hair, dressed in sliver and grey metal and leather armor, seated by a tall marble pillar. On the ground next to her was an ornate metal helm and a backpack. She was staring at the monument, apparently lost in thought. "I would like to talk with her. How do I get to the Memorial?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could describe the route, or you could teleport to just outside the Memorial and enter from there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Teleport, seems simpler." A flash of blackness, a twisting of her insides, and Sophia was floating in a seated position above a small meadow at the edge of a large lake. Slowly she stretched her foot down, then stood. Tyana materialized beside her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Follow the path to your right and it will lead to the intruder. I will monitor in case it needsto be caged."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">showing a round dark granite chamber, lit with phosphorescence on the walls. Odd patterned carvings swooped between tall protrusions of rock, whose function was not at all obvious. A round well, surrounded by twisted spines of rock, puffed steam into the center of the chamber. A dark passage ramped up from an opening in the far wall. "Alright, that's rather strange."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know how easy finding them will be here. The air will support you, ambient temperature is cool compared to your body temperature, but barely below the comfortable range. I have no indication of local conditions or life-forms. There are none in the immediate area. I recommend selecting protective gear and weapons from your wardrobe before exiting the hut," Tyana replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Weapons? What am I going to do with weapons? I've never fought in my life!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am afraid you will need to learn, mistress. Most of the multi-verse is rather hostile, particularly to strangers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, and where am I supposed to learn? Can you teach me? Do I have to worry about survival in here with the power systems messed up?"</p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Training</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia opened the wardrobe in her room and stared at the various items hanging within. They ranged from very revealing to almost fully covering and were in deep reds, purples, and blacks. None of them looked like the bullet proof vests and body armor she had been expecting. "Tyana, I thought you said protective wear?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"All of those are enhanced with magic. They will protect you against most average weapons."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In a large chest she found an assortment of shields and helms. In another there was an assortment of knives, swords, battle-axes, and other edged weapons. "No guns?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are a few energy weapons available, however, finding replacement power crystals is very difficult most places. They wouldn't serve you very well. It's even worse for slug-throwers. You're better off with simpler weapons that function everywhere."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She tried several different weapons before settling on two short swords. One looked to be extremely sharp and narrowed to an impossibly long point at the end. The other had small burst of lightning crackling along the length of the blade. "Good choices, however, for training, could you take the other two? The ones you just picked up have enough enchantments to be really dangerous before you have sufficient skill."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Which of the garments would you recommend?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Any of them. They all have similar protection, so pick the style you like." Sophia pulled out the dark black, most covering, set and set them on the bed. She started to say something, then shrugged, stripped, and slid into the clothes. They settled on her frame and seemed to shrink and expand until they fit perfectly. She picked up one of the swords and swung it clumsily around, noticing the clothes didn't grab or bunch as she moved.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Florentine style? Just so you know, that's one of the harder styles to learn. I'm going to start by teaching you simple blocks and parries. Then we'll work up to attacks. And you're going to have a training regimen to tone you up and increase your stamina." Sophia rolled her eyes. "Or you can go outside unprepared and probably die." Sophia just nodded and gripped her practice weapons.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Restless</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia stopped in the middle of practice the next afternoon. "This is good and all, but how long do I have to stay in here? I need to get out. The emptiness and silence is beginning to get to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't keep you here. You are the mistress and you are free to come and go as you please. Just be aware, it can be very dangerous outside. You would be safer with more training." Tyana replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have to get out and see for a bit," Sophia said. She started toward the door from the throne room to the interface. "Uh, wait, is there any way I will be able to learn the local languages?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you good at languages?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The hut has a translation system, however, it works best on places where it has been before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia took a few more steps toward the door and stopped as her confidence seeped away. "I, ok, you win. I don't know anything about this and I don't know what I'm doing, and I am scared, and tired, and," she folded to the floor and began crying in ragged sobs. "I can't do this. Please, just send me back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't do that. There is no way to get you home without your help." Tyana crouched down next to Sophia and held her close while she continued to sob. "It'll be ok. You'll do fine. Just give yourself some time to figure things out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Time? What about my friends? What about my life?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I understand about friends, but was the rest of your life so good you wouldn't want to change it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, but I didn't get a choice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you have changed things on your own? Sometimes change needs a trigger, something to get started with." Tyana helped her rise and settled her into the throne. "Take a few minutes, then, if venturing out would help you, I can come along."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How does that work? Aren't you, you know, like a hologram or something?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have a shell I can use to leave for short times. I don't use it much because I can see and feel things much more completely through the hut interfaces."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Stepping Out</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia stirred in the throne and said, "I need to see outside, even if just a little bit. Then I can accept returning to training."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very well, but you should at least put on some of the protective wear."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"None of it looks any better than what I have on, and most of it looks like it was designed by a deranged fan-boy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"All three versions provide the same level of protection, which is quite high by most standards."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Even the one that looks like a glorified swim suit?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Even that one. I did ask Irena why those designs once. She just smiled and said, 'Sex distracts. While my oponent is looking at what I'm not wearing, I get an extra few moments to act first. Besides, if you've got it, flaunt it.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh. Am I to assume Irena is quite beautiful then? That attitude might work for the beautiful people, but what about the rest of us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, another person with self-image issues. You are quite beatiful, even if you can't see it. Nothing says you have to wear the revealing ones, there's still the more modest, full body version. Once you decide on a style you prefer, we can modify something to your personal tastes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll go change and be right back." Sophia returned a few minutes later in the full coverage, black silk set of trousers and long sleeved top. It clung and fit tighter than she was immediately comfortable with, but wasn't nearly as bad as the next choice. "It clings more than I would like, but it will be ok, I guess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What you arrived in was more revealing than that," Tyana reminded her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, but I was going clubbing, and hoping to attract notice. I don't want to do that here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'll probably be fine. We can also change the wardrobe after we see the local conditions. Do you still want to go or shall we return to your training?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I still want to go outside," Sophia replied as she walked toward the door to the interface room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The interface looked like a small peasant hovel, with a small fire pit, a rough cot, tiny table and a couple of chairs, and cookware hanging over a narrow counter. A ladder led up to an attic and a trap door closed off what might have been a cellar. A small brazier, sculpted to resemble an impossible monster of teeth and claws rested on the shelf. Something about it drew Sophia's gaze.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That won't work while the power system is damaged," Tyana said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Won't work?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, right, you wouldn't know. That can be expnded and controlled by a whistle in the desk in your room. It expands to a size that can hold four people comfortably and then it travels under whistle commands."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh," Sophia said, staring at it for a few more moments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tyana crossed to the far door. It was ornate, carved in strange beasts and symbols, everything so detailed they seemed to move around the door when Sophia wasn't looking. "This is the main portal. Outside of here we are back in the Real Space Realms. Nothing can gain access through this door without your direct approval, although, once it is given, that being may come and go as they please, unless you rescind the permission. Are you ready?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Into the Realm</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tyana opened the door at Sophia's nod, Dry air, laden with the scent of old dust and stone, filtered into the room. Outside an enormous cavern soared to a high vault over a large stone platform, sitting on a tongue of rock over a vast chasm. Tyana wavered, sagged, and would have fallen if Sophia hadn't grabbed her. "What's wrong?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Too much damage. I can't maintain outside with this much damage."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You there! You, near the strange building, where did you come from?" A tall woman, wearing silver and grey leather and metal armor, called as she strode toward Sophia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Us?" Sophia asked puzzled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, you. Are you touched or something, girl? Who else would I be talking to? Why did you bring me here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You did. I saw your building shimmer and fade then some type of magic wave crashed over me and I woke up here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Feild and nav system damage. It must have been worse than I thought," Tyana whispered, sinking lower. "Get me back inside, please." Sophia turned to help Tyana back through the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh no, don't you leave me here with no answers!" the woman shouted, running toward Sophia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh alright, come on in then," Sophia snapped over her shoulder. "Tyana, where are those stone doors and that chamber we saw?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. Echoes from the nav sys maybe. With the power systems as damaged as they are, it might be almost anything," Tyana replied as Sophia helped her to one of the battered old chairs in the entry room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who the hell...holy hells, what kind of magic do you have here?" The woman staggered as she cleared the door, sinking to the floor and clutching her head. For a few moments she huddled there before slowly easing herself onto a low stool. "Who are you, how did you learn to control such powerful magic, and why have you brought me here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm Sophia and this is Tyana. I..someone brought us here against my will as well. I don't know what is going on, other than this thing, that supposedly brought me here, is damaged."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've been waiting for days for you to come out of your little house. My world is being ravaged by a mad-man and I won't be able to stop it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who is this mad-man?" Tyana whispered from the chair.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lord Shalmar, one of the Wizard Lords of my world, and he is seeking to conquer the other Wizard Lords and enslave everyone under his rule. I was trying to acquire a powerful artifact that would have let me defend against him, until your magic brought me here. Please, you must send me back!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do I have to do to convince you that there is nothing I can do? I was brought here, just as you were. This thing is broken, it can't go anywhere."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Liar!" the woman screamed. She pulled a dagger and threw herself at Sophia, only to be stopped in a pillar of harsh red light. Tyana groaned and Sophia staggered as exhaustion ripped through her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia staggered to the woman, pulled the dagger from her hand, and collapsed to her knees on the floor. "Stop," she called in a ragged whisper. "Stop or it will kill you." For long moments the woman stared defiantly at Sophia before relaxing slightly. Instantly the light snapped off and she stumbled forward a step and slid down to sit on the floor. Sophia rocked back until she was sitting cross-legged facing her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What happened to you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She is bound to this item. Everything that happens to it, happens to her, and happens to me," Tyana answered. "It is damaged, so we feel the damage as pain and weakness. You are lucky. If you had tried that under normal conditions you would have been turned inside out without having a chance to reply." Tyana almost smiled at the shock on the woman's face. "You know who we are. I think it's time you returned the favor."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The woman hesitated long moments, the replied slowly, "I am Lady Ayrthane."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dorotea, it's a pleasure to meet you!" Sophia said without thinking. In her mind she saw the character data for Lady Dorotea Ayrthane, wizard lord of Formnought Holding, on the world designated as Wizilandria, world after the wizards went to war.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dorotea stiffened, "How do you know my name?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, um, oh..." Sophia trailed into silence, shocked back from her memories.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Names have great power in many realms, mistress," Tyana added. "You would be wise to be careful in the sharing of ours and the mentioning of others."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where do you come from to know of realms? What matter of sorceress are you and what have you studied?" Dorotea asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sorceress? I know nothing of magic," Sophia answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mistress, I must rest. Please excuse me," Tyana rose slowly and stumbled toward the hanging at the back of the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dorotea's eyes followed her, then turned a puzzled gaze on Sophia. "I thought this was a single roomed hovel."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am remiss, now that I have invited you in, I should offer hospitality. Come, let me offer you food and drink," Sophia said as she struggled to her feet. Dorotea rose and followed her through the hanging, into the throne room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This..this is the Hut of All Worlds," Dorotea whispered. "The oldest myths speak of this room and its curious ceiling. Forgive me mistress. If I had known I would never have spoken so harshly to you." She dropped to her knees in a deep bow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Get up!" Sophia said sharply. "I don't deserve to be bowed to." She turned abruptly and shuffled toward the door in the wall to her right. She crossed the richly apponted dining area to the far corridor and then to the kitchen. She pulled a bottle of wine from a place on the counter and laid out the bread and cheese she had found earlier. "I am sorry I cannot offer more, however, I don't know where the store rooms are yet. Please, eat, drink, and relax," she explained as she sank onto a stool. "Soon I must rest. I am sure there are guest chambers in here somewhwere if you would choose to rest here instead of at your camp."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are treating me well, mistress. I will accept and enjoy your hospitality and remain so you cannot slip away without me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tyana, where would we find rooms for our guest?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The door on the fifth landing of the Central Stair has the least oddly decorated bed chamber."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, Tyana." Sophia waited until Dorotea had finished then conducted her to the chamber. "If you wake up before me, you can get something in the kitchen, wait in the dining room, or take the stairs down to the fifth door, cross the cloisters to any of the inner doors and wait in the library. I'll join you when I wake up." She then turned to her own chambers and fell into dreamless sleep.</p>

<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Dorotea</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sophia awoke and stumbled to the kitchen. Blearily, she looked for the coffee maker before memory returned. "Awake at last," Dorotea called from her seat on a high stool near one of the many counters. Sophia fumbled through the steps to make coffee, without replying to Dorotea. "What are your plans today? Going to fix this thing so I can go home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia just grimaced, filled a cup and sipped coffee. Finally she replied, "Is there any way to convince you that I have no clue about how to fix this thing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, no. You have a magical aura that is obviously attached to this thing and you are able to command it. How could you be in that position without understanding?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia slumped forward on her stool and put her head in her hands. "Believe what you have to. I know I need things called 'Control Crystals' for something in the 'Core Systems'. The Core Systems I will look at this morning, and I know what control crystals look like, but I have no idea how to find them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's go then!" Dorotea stood and headed for a door. "Lead on."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need coffee and food first," Sophia replied, still leaning heavily on the counter next to her stool.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dorotea stared at her for a few minutes, then rose, walked to the cooler and began pulling out food. She slammed a large plate of cheese, cold mystery meat, and bread in front of Sophia. "There, food." She hovered while Sophia slowly ate several bites and then said, "Ok, you can come back for the rest."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia glared at her, but got slowly to her feet and led the way through the dining room and into the throne room. "Unholy hells, the legends didn't do this justice," Dorotea said as she stopped and stared up at the stars overhead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Coming?" Sophia asked as she opened a hidden door in one of the skull carvings behind the throne. She kept a firm hold on her coffee cup as she descended the narrow ladder to a small room with a single oval metal door. The wheel handle spun easily, withdrawing the heavy steel locking pins from their holdings and the door swung away from her on well oiled hinges. A ragged, uneven pulsing sound beat on them as they stepped into the massive room. Machinery, wires, cables, tubes, and odd constructions filled the room in a tangle of confusing clusters. Magical energy hammered against Dorotea's senses, driving her into a huddled crouch as she slowly followed Sophia into the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia stopped and stared around the room. Concept sketches came back to her and she slowly approached the third panel on the right. She reached out and touched one of the buttons. A screen lit up and text began scrolling up it. "Damn it, what was that command, ah right!" Her fingers flew as she typed in the command for low level details of all failures. A list of damaged control crystals and their locations printed across the screen. "Why didn't I pay attention in those design meetings?" she muttered as she looked at the list.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?" Dorotea asked from where she was huddled on the floor next to the console.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing, just wishing about the past and mumbling to myself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When I want to remember, I try thinking of something else. What the sky was like, if there was a particular scent in the air, what I had recently eaten, things like that. It tricks the mind into a context and then the memories often return," Dorotea suggested through clenched teeth. "Are you close to finished? I can't take much more of this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could wait in the throne room." Sophia frowned in concentration and then smiled, "Yes, I remember. They are accessible from this world. If they weren't, there'd be no way to get anywhere. Where were they going to be? Right, we hadn't decided yet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This isn't a game, girl. Unless you are a godling, and if you are, you should send me back. Right this instant!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Godling, right, in my dreams. I'm just a community coordinator and character designer. I bet I could tell you a lot about yourself, Tyana, and Kyira, and maybe even some of the citizens of nearby cities, but that's it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can we talk about this somewhere else?" Dorotea muttered, crawling toward the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, yeah, sure..." Sophia replied in a distracted tone. Once they were back in the throne room Sophia settled into the throne and asked, "Are you ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. I can feel magical energy and that place was worse than the rest of this place. Can't you feel it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A bit, maybe. There's a sense of warmth and comfort but also a sense of sickness and pain. If you can sense magic, can you also find magical items? If I were to show you one of the control crystals, could you narrow in on it? It would really help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What you ask is no simple thing, girl. It would require great spells and months or years of research to create such a spell and it would only work if the thing in question was not ensorcelled to prevent discovery. Why can't you find them? You're linked to this thing, shouldn't you be able to feel parts of it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. It didn't occure to me to try it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe we should go try then? You seem completely confused about so many things, so I must ask, what skills do you have?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can create characters, set them up, recruit actors and..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No girl, what kinds of survival skills? What magics do you know, what weapons can you weild, that sort of thing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, none..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"None! And I have to rely on you to get me home? What sick fate have the gods conspired for me now?" A deep gong shimmered through the air of the throne room. "What the hell was that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A summons from friends of mine. I could go to them if this thing worked."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need to think. I'll be in the library," Dorotea said as she strode off abruptly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you think she's safe?" Tyana asked from the air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Keep an eye on her. Tell Kyira to carefully watch what she selects to read. I think she's ok, but let's not take too many chances with her. Is there any way you can speed teach me anything to help me venture out of here sooner? She's going to get bothersome very soon, I suspect."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm afraid it isn't that simple, mistress. I wish it were," Tyana replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Sophia - Dorotea 2</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why did you send me to the library when you knew I wouldn't be able to read anything?" Dorotea shouted as she stormed back into the throne room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, right. I forgot about that. It's the same for me and Kyira has no idea either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Great, just great," she muttered as she paced back and forth in front of the throne.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Look, I know it sucks to be you right now, but my life isn't so wonderful either. So rather than screaming at me, how about we try and figure out what's going on? Can you do that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you have any idea who you are talking to?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you? Piss me off too much and I'll toss your ass outside and leave you there!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will try."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do the legends say about this?" Sophia waved her hand at the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much detail. Invincible, indestructable, run by either a mad-woman or a deity, those kinds of things. You are supposed to be immortal and unkillable."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The instanced versions will only transport the near-dead back to their hut for healing." Sophia replied without thought.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's a word in there that I didn't understand. What does instanced mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It means this is one of many copies of this hut, all based off the original Hut of All-Worlds. Irena and her companions created copies, with reduced feature sets, umm, with reduced powers, to recruit help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't believe you. Convince me that you really know what you are talking about."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fine. How about I tell you all about yourself?" Sophia replied. She proceeded to detail the world of the mage wars, the wars, the death, the rise of the Wizard Lords from the shattered remains and the low order arcane survivors. By the time she was finished Dorotea was shaking and white, leaning heavily against the throne for support. "Now do you believe?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ye..yes." Dorotea slid down the edge of the throne and sat, leaning her back against it, absorbing a bit of comfort from the solidity of it. "What, what do we do now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No change, fix this thing and see about getting us home." Sophia pushed herself up from the throne and walked toward the far doors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aren't you forgetting weapons?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right, I'll be right back." Sophia returned with two swords, one on each hip. "Not that they'll help me much, since I don't know how to use them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is one of those Soul Eater?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia turned white, "No. We don't get Soul Eater and I wouldn't wear it if we did!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But to suck the souls of your enemies, know their every thought, wouldn't that be useful?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And risk madness or worse every time I used it? I don't think so!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about the Hand of Retribution? Do you have that? It would make you a credible opponent since you don't know how to use the swords."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think that's available either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then what are you going to do if someone attacks?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Die, test out my theories? I don't know, but we can't fix anything hiding in here. I'm going crazy with waiting and sitting."</p>
