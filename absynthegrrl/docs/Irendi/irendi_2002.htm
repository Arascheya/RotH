<p class="pagecaption">Irendi - Chapter 2</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Laughing, arm in arm, we headed to Valarie's apartment to call the realtor. As we passed the courtyard an older couple glanced our way and scowled in disgust. Something perverse made me smile and wave as they turned away.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">An hour later we were in his office making an offer. He was ecstatic with it as he'd had no offers on the place since it first listed. No one seemed interested in an obvious fixer upper. He suggested several mortgage companies that would work with us to develop a partnership mortgage, but I wanted to try my bank first, they'd always treated me well and deserved first option.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Monday during lunch I spent a very frustrating time at my bank. Everything looked good except they wouldn't loan to partnerships for single family dwellings. They said they had enough trouble with married couples, getting stuck in the middle, to want to deal with anything even more nebulous. I called several other places and got the same story.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the afternoon I was restless and frustrated. I paced around the office constantly. Finally it got so bad Jeff called me into his office to ask what was wrong. The story of the banks just tumbled out, fueled by my anger. He gave me a funny look as he asked, "So why the sudden interest in the country, anyway? Are you in love with this woman or something?" The look stopped me cold. Suddenly I was downplaying the entire episode.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the afternoon dragged on forever. When time came I was out the door without a look back. Next I was stuck in traffic for an hour and a half. When I finally dragged myself into the complex, my head was on fire. I shoved my head in Valarie's apartment just long enough to yell I was going for a run.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hours later I returned, slightly calmer. When I explained what had happened her reaction scared me badly, "God damn homophobic assholes, why does it always have to be so hard because we're two women wanting a place? Every damn time it's the same bullshit."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Valarie, that's not what they said."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Of course not, it never is. Ever since the laws changed they've had to hide it a little bit, but it's the same thing. By the way the owners are thinking of selling the complex. There's no guarantee we'll be safe under the new owners, either."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Valarie, there are laws now..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, right, it just means they have to be more creative, that's all. You haven't had to deal with this before, I have."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Helpless in the face of her rage I tried to shift the subject. "I wish I had taken the list of mortgage places when it was offered."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She at least grinned slightly when she reached into her pocket and pulled out a folded piece of paper. "Here, I figured we'd need it." Once I called a place from the list, things started to move along. There were hassles over the title, and other little odds and ends, but overall the process went smoothly. It was just as well, as things around the complex were getting very bad. The owners insisted Valarie correct the problems they'd let slide for years. They also insisted on every unit being rented and a rent increase besides. She had to hang around the place any time there was an open unit.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Two months later the mortgage people called to arrange a time to sign all the papers. I could barely contain my excitement until the end of the day. On my way home I stopped for flowers and champagne, planning to surprise Valarie. I came home to find her curled up on the couch crying. "They fired me. They said I wasn't needed anymore, that they could do the job themselves. I have until the end of the month to pack and get out."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I sat beside her, placed the flowers in her hand, and said, "We don't need to worry, we're moving anyway. We sign the papers tomorrow! Then we can move in."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Several days later I was packing my apartment. I had finished with all the easy stuff and was down to the fragile odds and ends that wouldn't fit easily anywhere. Finally the frustration got too great and I headed out to run. As I was leaving the complex I heard Valarie's name mentioned through an open window. Stalking close my heart did a flip, it was the old couple I'd harassed earlier. "Well, we got rid of the dyke bitch manager, now all we have to do is encourage the rest of the queers to move. Then we'll have a safe, family environment here again." I roared in rage before I realized how angry I was. Suddenly silence descended as I ran from the area. I had a leisurely jog around the area and headed back. It was easy to dodge the zoo van parked in the driveway. I wasn't so lucky with the sniper, though. As I moved toward my apartment a shot rang out. Burning pain slammed through my flank and I roared in rage. Quickly it became harder and harder to move. Vision blurring and fading, I ran, then walked, then dragged myself toward Valarie's apartment. With my last strength I let out a small whimper as darkness closed in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I awoke to sunlight and warm arms around me. Valarie's tired face greeted me. "Morning beautiful. How you feeling?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I started to turn toward her, only to scream as my head exploded. "Like shit." I whispered, clutching my head, trying to keep the fragments together. Gently she disentangled herself and went for menstrual pain medicine, the only thing that ever seemed to work for me. "You were lucky, babe. You collapsed right outside my place and shifted as you slept. I had just gotten you in when the trackers prowled by. Damn, that was close. What happened anyway?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I, uh, made too much noise when I left to go run last night. My mind was too busy on other things."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You've gotta be careful, imagine what they'd do to you if they found out what you can do." Her words struck deep. I hadn't even thought about that since the first night. The thought made me shiver, the wrong thing to do with my head pounding.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once the meds took effect we managed to get the first load of stuff to our place. By the end of the day we had a lot of the important stuff moved. Too tired to sort anything, we dropped the mattress in the living room, grabbed a couple of sleeping bags, and crashed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I awoke at dawn, quietly slipped out of bed, and out the back door, changing as I cleared the porch. I had a wonderful early morning run through the nearby fields, returning pleasantly warmed up. I came into the back area to find Valarie working on an older motorcycle. Silently I stalked toward her, then shoved my wet nose against her bare thigh. With a yelp she turned and pounced on my back. We rolled in the grass and dust as she tried to pin me down while I took playful swats at her and playful licks at any place I could reach. Finally I shifted back and our wrestling turned into rough and tumble loving, leaving us both exhausted in the grass. Laughing we stumbled back into the house for water and clean clothes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Later in the afternoon I headed back for the last of my stuff, leaving her back at the cycle. When I returned she had just kicked it over and was fiddling with the engine. Not wanting to disturb her concentration I finished moving my stuff in and sat on the porch. Finally satisfied, she turned to head inside, waving as she went. "Looks like she still runs. I was going to take her for a test spin, want to come?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, but a bike ride sounds fun to." I replied playfully.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Slut, I'll take care of you later..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mmmm, I hope so! Uh...what do I do? I've never done this before."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just hop on behind me and put your arms around me. Lean the way I do, when I do. Oh yeah, and hang on!" She kicked off and with a roar we were on our way. She took it pretty easily actually, running over some of the old roads around the place, crashing through tall grasses and small brush. It was almost as good as running. Midway into the ride I shifted to ease a cramp and found a much better way to sit. The vibrations of the motor's purr soon worked magic on me. In moments I was as revved up as the bike. Happy and turned on I pressed myself tighter against Valarie, unconsciously rubbing my breasts against her back. She slowed and turned, "You ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Eyes almost closed I managed to answer, "Oh yesssss! This is great!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I thought you'd like it." With a wicked smile and a small flick of her tongue she turned forward and took off again. Another turn brought us to the main road, with a quick twist of the throttle we roared along the pavement. With a quick flourish she spun us into the driveway and back to where we had started. "So, what do you think?" she asked as she slid to a stop.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I leaned my head forward and traced the edge of her ear with my tongue, "I need a quick comparison, to see if this really is as good as sex. Think you could help?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With a laugh she was off the bike. Hands fumbled with clothes as we pushed and pawed at each other. I shoved her clothes aside and fastened my mouth on her nipple, teasing and tonguing at the stiffening flesh. Lightly I ran my fingernails up and down her sides as her hands tangled in my hair, shoving my head harder against her. My hands dropped and pulled her hips firmly against me as I thrust against her leg. With a moan her hands dropped to my butt and pulled me tight. Her motions took up counterpoint to mine. Sobbing moans escaped as she stiffened against me, her back arched as she howled her climax. Lightly shaking she dropped her head to my shoulder and began nipping and licking at my neck. Within moments it was my turn to howl into the sunlight as her teeth gnawed at my ear.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With a sigh we collapsed to the ground, still clinging tightly to each other. We lay for long moments until our breathing returned to normal. Smiling, I reached up and ran my fingers through her hair as her tongue traced my face. "Well, is it better than sex?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure yet, more comparisons will be needed."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Greedy slut. I'm sure we can work on it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Monday came all too soon and it was back to the grind. Jeff was even more tense than usual, something about a project review, but no one would tell him which project and when. It hadn't helped that I'd gotten caught in traffic and was half an hour late for the Monday progress meeting. During the meeting we were informed that our budget reports needed to be fully reconciled for the review, whenever it was to be. It looked like the rest of my week would be spent in paperwork, instead of real work.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Headed home that night I enviously eyed the carpool lanes as I sat stuck in traffic yet again. Then a motorcycle sped by and inspiration struck. I took the steps two at a time and threw myself into Valarie's arms. After a fierce kiss I pulled back and asked her to teach me to ride. "Look, it'll save me time getting home, and think of the fun we can have riding places together!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why are you trying to convince me, I'm not your parents, I'd be happy to teach you!" We started that evening. It took very little time and soon I was at the traffic division for my test. Proudly I stood by Valarie's bike dressed in my new leathers and helmet.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The test was thorough, I was very glad Valarie had taken so much time on the nitpicky little things. As usual that was what the bureaucrats tested. Three hours later I was taking us to a bike shop, new license in my pocket.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ever been in one of these places before?" I shook my head. "Just be cool, some of the guys here can be the epitome of macho male."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I felt eyes on us as soon as we cleared the door. Sure enough three guys by the counter were giving us the once over. As nonchalantly as possible I headed over to the nearest bike. It was a real beauty, ___ horsepower, shiny chrome and a wonderful emerald green. The watchers tracked us as I quickly scanned the selections, then returned to the green machine. Intently I studied it, quietly asking Valarie's advice on several points. Suddenly a voice boomed out behind me, "New rider, huh?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Excuse me?" I replied coolly as I turned to see the man from behind the counter.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"New rider, aren't you? No wear marks on your leathers. It might be better to start with something smaller than that one. That one's better for an experienced rider. You might also consider an electric start, some of these larger engines are a bit difficult."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like to try this one, thank you." With a shrug he walked it out into the parking area and indicated I should go for it. With a tight smile I climbed on and kicked it over. Nothing happened. Laughter erupted from the door as I bent down and checked the fuel shut off and kicked it again. It gave a small cough but remained stubbornly silent.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Here little lady, maybe you should let a man do it." One of the other customers was striding my way. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Valarie stiffen and start to turn toward him. Frustrated I kicked again and was rewarded with a cough, then a roar that settled into a throaty purr. With a laugh I eased in the throttle and was off around the lot, the now familiar vibration working its magic on me. I returned to the salesman and asked, "May I take it off the lot for a real test?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Let's see your license." He didn't look happy when he saw that I'd just gotten it. Indecision warred in his eyes for long moments while he looked from the license to me then back to the license.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I wouldn't if I was you. It's too much for her, surely that's obvious."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shut up, Ted. Does your old lady know you're out here instead of lookin' for work?" He looked at me once more, then shrugged, "It's your funeral."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With a grin, I grabbed my helmet from Valarie, pulled it on, and headed for the open road. On the freeway ramp I opened it up. I was doing sixty by the time I hit the freeway. In moments I was screaming past everything else on the road. I kept opening up until the engine reached a satisfying rumbling growl then I looked at my speed, 105 mph, no wonder I was passing everything in sight. Exhilarated, I screamed along for a few minutes before spotting an exit to turn back at. "Very nice, I'll take it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just like that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yup," I answered as I pulled my gold card from my pocket. "I think this'll handle it." I'd be many long months paying off this bill, but I didn't care. It was lust at first ride. "Oh yeah, where would I go for some custom paint work on the tank? I think I'd like a running panther on it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yo, Ted, you gotta possible customer here, if ya treat her nice." He slouched over and looked me up and down, slowly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I explained what I wanted, ignoring his less than subtle body language. "I'll pay a ten percent bonus if you can get to it by the end of the week." Artfully I turned to Valarie, subtly giving him a more flattering view.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Um...I..think I can manage that." He was practically drooling in his beard. With a smile and a thank you I turned and walked toward the shop to complete the sale.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How could you not notice that clown drooling all over you?" Valarie exploded as we sat waiting for lunch. "Gods, I haven't seen a man that bad in years, ugh!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Babe, I knew exactly what he was doing, but it got me my paint job in a hurry, didn't it? If he wants to be that way, far be it for me not to take full advantage of it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She stared for a moment then burst out laughing. "You know, I think you're going to be good for me. I like the way you see things."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The week went by slowly at work, but it screamed by at home. We were taking stock of all the repairs we were going to have to make to the place. First was the roof, which leaked in several places, then the front porch, where dry rot was eating most of the supports. After that a thorough rewiring would be in order, and probably plumbing upgrades. It was while we were exploring the attic that we found out Valarie was badly allergic to the old insulation up there. We spent a long Thursday night in the emergency ward while they pumped her full of antihistamines and adrenaline to keep her breathing. It was also the first time I had to deal with prejudice up front and personal. I was sitting with her when the doctor came in to examine her. Her gaze caught sight of Valarie's earrings, and mine, and she immediately stiffened. Her questions, which had been friendly and concerned, turned cold and clinical. Her final question was the worst, however. "Now are you sure your 'friend' doesn't have AIDS? There are many complications that look just like this. Well, we'll just have to run a test or two first, to be sure. Until then you'll just have to wait outside for her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'd prefer to wait here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Unless you're related I'm afraid that's not possible. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to order some tests." When I still hadn't moved, she started to reach for the call button. "Do I need to call security?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Silently I retreated from the room. In the waiting area I found myself pacing, keeping time with a young man who was doing the same. After several near collisions we started talking. He was waiting for his first baby. For most of the conversation I managed to keep up the facade that Valarie was only a good friend, then the doctor came out. "You 'friend' is negative, surprisingly enough. She's being treated for severe allergic reaction. You might as well go home, we won't release her until morning."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"May I see her?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, I don't care what your relationship with her is, you are not family. Goodnight to you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Bitch," I muttered as I turned to go. The young guy came over, looking embarrassed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I couldn't help but overhear, what did she mean by all that, anyway?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It meant my friend was HIV negative, which I'd tried to tell her before, and that because we're not related I can't get in to see her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute, the two of you are lovers?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, that's right, why?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Because, before my wife and I were married I could get in to see her when she was in for a bad fall. All I had to do was explain we were engaged. When they changed the rules to allow gays to see their SOs they also changed the rules for straight, non married partners."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Really, hmmm, I hadn't realized they'd actually changed those, thank you!" I strode over to the desk and said, "I wish to see Valarie Jason."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry, the doctor said only her family can see her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm her family here. I'd like to see her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'll have to check with the doctor, one moment please." She turned to the pager and called for doctor Jamison.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You again, I thought I told you to go home."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Look, whether you like it or not, I'm Valarie Jason's lover and thus I have a right to see her. There are laws protecting my rights to access, just as there are for straights, like you. So, I can either see her, or start a discrimination lawsuit in the morning. Which will it be?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With an angry glare she turned and led me back into the emergency complex. "She's in there. Tell someone when you leave." With a muttered, "Damn queers," she turned and walked away.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valarie was doing much better with the drugs in her system, although she was extremely apologetic about the whole thing. We waited the next two hours until another doctor checked to make sure she was still ok, then headed home. Work in the morning was hell. Several times Jeff walked in to ask me something and I'd wake up as he started talking. "Long night?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I had to take Val...a friend to the hospital last night with a very bad allergy attack. We were there most of the night."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just remember, we're paying you to work, not to sleep. That progress report needs to be ready for the meeting tomorrow morning."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Disgusted, I fought with the cat as I left the meeting. I had gotten the report ready, yet never had to give it. Still fuming I stalked toward my section. The only thing that got me through the day was the realization my bike would be done that night and I could finally start riding it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Valarie, you've got to see this! I know that guy Ted was such an asshole, but he's done a marvelous job with my panther!" He had done a truly marvelous job of portraying a black panther running through the jungle, caught in mid leap from one fallen tree trunk to another.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The following Monday I rode my new bike to work, grinning to myself as I passed all the cars crawling along in the non-carpool lanes. Exhilarated from the ride I strode into the building and headed for the ladies room to change. As I was crossing the lobby Jeff came in from the elevators, stopped, stared a moment and said, "De?? Since when did you cycle to work?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I just started. It's so much better than crawling through traffic." His gaze followed me to the restroom. I pulled the peasant skirt and blouse out of my pack sack and shook them out before changing into them. The one drawback I'd need to figure out was how to keep from wearing extremely wrinkled things all the time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For a while I was pleasantly surprised at how many heads I turned, but then it began to get old when the long, appraising stares started. I had never considered myself that attractive so I wasn't really used to that level of attention.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"De, would you stay a moment?" Jeff asked as the Thursday staff meeting finally broke up. "I've been meaning to talk with you for a while now, just have never gotten the chance. I personally like the clothes you've started wearing, they make you look more feminine and attractive, but do you think they're appropriate for a person of your position? We are working on government contracts here and have a certain image to maintain."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rapidly I curbed the cat's irritation and attempted to stay calm as I answered, "I'm not sure I see that. I am a woman, and as such should be able to dress nicely if I wish. I find it hard to believe that I become less professional because of that. Surely the contractors can accept that women are as capable as men these days. That's what all the equal rights fights were about."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Um, true, it's just I think it would be easier on them if you'd wear things a little closer to what you used to wear. Please think about it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'll do that." I replied in as neutral a voice as I could manage.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now, I've been meaning to ask, how are you doing? Are you recovering from the terrible episode in the park? How about Alan, are you ok over that also? He was a good man, I'm sorry he cracked like that. If you ever need someone to talk to I'd appreciate it if you'd consider me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The snarl started deep inside but I still barely managed to catch it before it escaped. His entire tone raised the cat's hackles. "I'll do that, Jeff. Um...thanks." As quickly as I could I retreated from the room. It was all I could do not to shudder as I walked toward my section.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">About a week later I had a truly wonderful ride in. The weather was perfect, traffic was mild, and Valarie and I had woken slowly and passionately to the day. I felt like I was glowing when I entered the
building I worked in.
</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Traci must have noticed too as I strode into the restroom to change. "You seem so much happier lately De."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm in love and she's so wonderful!" Then I realized what I'd said as I saw the startled look on Traci's face.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Then she smiled, "It can be so good, can't it. I wouldn't let Jeff know, he doesn't deal well with that at all. Want to do lunch today?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, sure.." I replied, startled at the change of subject.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, see ya at noon!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">All morning I was puzzled by Traci's response. Time slowly crawled its way to noon, when I could finally hurry to the door. Traci took me to a place I'd never been, making a big show of talking about fashions and hair stylists, and all sorts of other things until we had been served our lunches. Finally she bent a little closer and explained how she'd overheard Jeff and Jack talking about increasing surveillance on several people. One of them was me. "I'd be very careful for a while, especially if Jeff is making passes at you. About three years ago he started coming on to me really strongly. I finally got fed up, brought in a picture of my lover, and told him in no uncertain terms that I was a lesbian. Until then I was happily installed in the Software Analysis and Test team. After that I was 'promoted' to Director of Data Processing Support. As you know, a glorified title for making sure everyone has printer paper." She saw my surprised look, "Yeah, I know, everyone thinks of me as Traci, the ditz, well I was very good at what I did. You want proof, give me a difficult software problem and I'll show you. I found out at about the same time that an internal investigation had been started around some missing data files. Fingers were pointed, people were questioned, and finally the whole thing was dropped, but not before they'd raked me over the fire a few times. The worst of it was the calls to my lover's place of work, and the questions and innuendos they passed to them. It took her over a year to re-establish the good working relations she had had to that time. Ever since then I've been playing low profile and waiting for enough time to pass where maybe I'll be able to look elsewhere for work without having to worry quite as much about a very slanderous reference."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You think I'm a possible target?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I've heard some talk between Jeff and Jack about another wave of missing data, this time from places you would have access to. I'm not sure why you'd be targeted, but I wouldn't talk about anything personal around the building. The first thing that happens is they tap your phone and bug your office."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Curious, and not wanting to think any more about what she'd told me about Jeff, I gave her the basics behind an analysis routine my team was stalled on. She thought a few moments, grabbed a napkin and began diagramming program modules and control flow. Within moments she had covered three napkins and was filling a fourth with object classes and descriptions. By the time we had finished eating she presented me with a five napkin solution. "There, see what they can do with that. I wouldn't tell anyone where or how you got this. Just like I wouldn't let on about your lover."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We walked back mostly in silence. I was lost in thought, wondering what other surprises the woman next to me might have. I presented the programming ideas to my team as something I'd been thinking about at lunch. A couple of them were skeptical since I wasn't noted for being a code wizard, but they glanced at it, then sat down and studied it. "Give us a couple of hours to code and test this, but it looks really good."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The afternoon passed quickly. Every so often I'd find my thoughts drifting from my work and back to Traci and her comments about Jeff. During one of those times he walked in. "Things going well? What are you doing for dinner tonight?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">All I was thinking was shit, now what do I do, as I tried to force polite things through my mouth. "Sorry, I'm busy tonight, I already agreed to go see a new show with a friend or two."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That woman you are buying the house with, Valarie Jason?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She's one of them, yes." I could have killed Traci and kissed her at the same time. Alarm bells were ringing loudly as I realized he'd thoroughly checked up on what was going on with my loan application and employment verification.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Darn, guess I'll have to give longer notice then, won't I?" He replied with a smile. "I wouldn't want you to stay in mourning for Alan for too long. It wouldn't be healthy for a charming woman such as you. Who knows, you might even do something strange and hang around other women. How about next Tuesday, say right after work?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think I already have plans, let me check." I made a great show of fumbling for my day planner while my mind scrambled for another excuse. "Ah, no, sorry, that's the night I work out with Traci and a couple of other women."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hm, sorry to hear that. Maybe when I get back from my business trip then. I'd be careful of Traci if I were you. Oh, that's right, you weren't working here when all that happened. She was implicated in a small security problem we had a few years back. Nothing was ever proved, and we aren't sure she really was a part of it, but all the same, I wouldn't talk about anything important around her. Not to mention, she's a known lesbian, and you know how they're always trying to recruit people. I'd hate to see you dragged into that kind of lifestyle."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The rage almost clawed its way out, but I managed to just hold it back by clenching my desk with all the force I had. I forced an "I'll be careful," through my tight throat and tried to stay neutral looking as he left. Once he was gone I was up and pacing my office for long minutes. Then, when I was a bit calmer, I went and invited Traci to the show Valarie and I were going to that night.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Just as I was preparing to leave Jim from the program team came in. "That was a great fix! It worked first time with no destructive interactions with the rest of the code."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The show was good, but not great. Traci and Valarie got along wonderfully. It seems they'd sort of known each other in high school so they sat and compared lives most of the evening. Before we split apart for the evening I asked Traci if she'd mind working out with Valarie and I on Tuesdays. She seemed a little puzzled until I explained my frantic motive from this afternoon. Then she readily agreed, as long as her partner could come along.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As we left the theatre something startled the cat. With a quick twist I was facing into a dark alley trying to identify the figure lurking there. With a quick nod it shrank back into the shadow and moved away down the alley. I turned back toward Valarie and Traci, only then realizing my hands had curled as if to pop my claws. "Someone was watching us."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's started already then. Jeff's been hitting on you, hasn't he?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes Traci, he has. He started shortly after I started cycling to work, and he really got bad this afternoon."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"At least the Women's Center won't care if he calls them about you and me," Valarie commented.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Something really smells here. As far as I could tell Jeff's a sleaze, but I never figured him for the character assassin type. Alan and I saw him and his last girlfriend several times socially, unfortunately. He treated her like shit, but I don't remember him going after her with the vengeance he went for you, or the way he seems to be after me. Traci, you remember Diana in Quality Control? She was his last. I think she managed three months. Before her he was with Allison from Production Control."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, your right," Traci responded thoughtfully. "Neither of them have been accused of anything, just us. I'll do a little grape vine checking, see what I can find out. It's kind of nice being 'The Ditz' once in a while, no one takes you seriously. Maybe that bogus position of mine can be useful."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Saturday morning found us still puzzling over what was happening where I worked. I wasn't paying much attention as I reached for the knife on the counter. My elbow hit the handle and flipped it off the counter and down into my foot. "Shit!" I exclaimed as I bent down to see a deep gash in the top of my foot. As I watched blood slowly began to well up out of the wound.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I dropped the damn knife into my foot," I replied as I moved to sit down. "What the hell???" I shouted as I saw the wound beginning to shrink, even as I watched. Valarie was beside me in a heartbeat. We both watched in confusion as the wound pulled itself together and knit over in the space of a few minutes. Soon all that was left were a few stains where blood had run down the side of my foot, and a few drops on the floor. We looked at each other, then at my foot again. We poked and examined the area, even the small white scar was fading away, as was the residual soreness. After fifteen minutes the only trace of the wound was the blood on the floor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Later in the day I had started on the dishes. I was washing an aluminum cook pan when my fingers touched the side. Pain shot through my hand, very similar to the acid burn I'd gotten in junior high chemistry. I reached for the pan and grabbed it by its handle. It felt normal. Carefully I tested everything else in the water. Nothing reacted like the pan. Very gently I touched the pan again. Immediately pain radiated up my arm as the skin on my fingertip began to turn greyish. "Valarie!" Panic edged my voice as I called her. "I just touched that pan and look what happened," I said as I displayed my burned finger for her examination.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That looks like an acid burn, but how?" She reached for the pan, taking it by the handle. Very carefully she reached out and touched it lightly, then placed her hand full against it. Nothing happened. She rinsed it and placed it in the drain board. "You think it's something from you being able to shape change?" She headed over to the fridge and grabbed a soda, pouring half of it into a glass and handing it to me.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know! I really don't know anything about all this." I cautiously finished the dishes. Nothing I could think of explained what had happened. When I was done I grabbed my soda and joined her out back where she was working in her garden. I dozed in the sun while she worked away.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The nausea had come on so gradually I really couldn't remember when it had exactly started. As the evening wore on it continued to get worse. By bed time I couldn't even hold down water and I was beginning to shake and twitch uncontrollably. Valarie was coping wonderfully, managing to stay calm as I was fighting not to be even more frenzied than I felt. I couldn't think of what to do, the last thing would be go to a hospital where they'd draw blood and then what would happen, assuming they'd even be able to get much.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Finally, in desperation, she mixed up one of her grandmother's herbal concoctions to try and calm me down. I don't know what was in it, but within minutes the shakes had stopped and the nausea was fading. About twenty minutes later I was eating and feeling fine.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I didn't think much more about it until I reached for the aluminum cook pot when I was putting away the dishes the next day. When my hand touched the aluminum of the pot I yanked it back as pain flashed again. "DAMN, I'll learn, really I will. I touched the pot again," I replied to her worried look. Something clicked then as I remembered the soda we'd split early yesterday, the one in the aluminum can. "Valarie..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valarie suddenly smiled and reached into the refrigerator. She grabbed the jar of herb tea from the previous night and shoved my fingers into it. Immediately the pain stopped and the grey, burned skin started to regenerate. After a few minutes my fingers were normal again. "It's going to be really hard for you not to come in contact with aluminum. Especially in places where you can't see it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We spent the rest of the day experimenting. If I managed to drink some of the herb tea after contact with aluminum, then I was fine. Even a small bit would counteract the effects. It worked especially well if I had ingested aluminum contaminated liquids. I found that I could feel a burning sensation if I concentrated a bit on the liquid I was swallowing. For contact damage, topical application was better if possible. We found that anything covering my skin was sufficient protection from contact. We also found that even a little of the herb mixture in a hand cream base would work as well as liquid, making it much easier to carry around.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Monday I found flowers on my desk along with a brief note from Jeff inviting me to lunch. It was written with a subtext that implied I should not refuse. I wanted to talk to Traci about it, but didn't, remembering her injunctions about bugs anywhere near my spaces. I assumed that she would also be wired, given we were known to spend time together.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lunch was a constant trial. His small talk was all about his achievements, plans, and money. If I had been listening from another booth I'd have thought he was giving his biography. Several times he tried to draw me out about my relationships with Valarie and Traci, once more 'warning' me against Traci. As we were finishing a desert that I could almost feel clogging my arteries, one of the wait staff came over with a bouquet of flowers. Jeff smiled his most charming and predatory smile as he presented them to me. "Here, something to remind you of me while I'm out of town." He insisted on taking my arm as we walked back. I rolled my eyes as we passed Traci's cubicle. He didn't release me until we arrived at my work area, after passing through most of the rest of the place. A grin twitched my mouth as I realized he'd just tried to 'mark' me as his. He must have seen the flicker of it as he released me because he smiled and said, "Try not to miss me too much while I'm gone."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think it'll be a problem." He looked almost puzzled for a brief instant, then smiled and headed to his office. Something made me glance back toward the copier where I saw Jack standing almost out of sight in the doorway. The smile he sent me couldn't have been called friendly.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The next Monday found me sitting in another one of Jeff's favorite romantic restaurants listening to him babble about his life. After a time he said, "I've talked about me both times now. How about we talk about you. I've heard some very nasty rumors about you and that woman you are sharing a home with. Now I could see where you'd be curious about other lifestyles after having Alan suddenly snap like he did, but I think you should know, all it really takes is the right man. I'm sure that you'd be able to settle down and raise a nice family if you just would let yourself go and take what's offered. Who knows, maybe something could be done about that ugly bit of business going on at the office. I know you couldn't possibly be involved in anything as dirty as espionage. I'm certain I could convince the investigators that you couldn't have been the one."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There are laws against this type of harassment..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There are also laws against international espionage. I believe they are a bit more severe than the harassment you could claim. Besides, whom would they believe, a suspected spy or the director of a prestigious military contractor? Come, come, De, save yourself the hassle, admit that you find me attractive and it'll all work out."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I might have admitted it once, when Alan, you and I first met, but now that I've seen how you behave, I can't. Good day to you." I shoved my chair back and started to stand.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Jack was right about you, you're just another male hating bitch. You'll be sorry for this. I'll make you pay, just like the others." He was still ranting as I walked away, trying to ignore the stares focused on him and watching me also.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">By the time I reached the office I was so angry I was shaking. I wanted to tear him apart and feel his blood flow. I wanted to shred his already fragile ego. I stalked in, told my team I'd see them tomorrow, and prepared to head home. Traci caught me as I was just starting my bike. "De, I'll come over after work. There are a few more people I need to see, but I think you'll find what I've found to be very interesting."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was a quick trip home. I placed a call to Valarie and told her not to meet me, that I was already home, then had her patch me into one of the center's phone counselors. I talked and ranted for about an hour. The woman on the other end had several good ideas about where to call for ways to deal with the harassment I was getting.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valarie arrived home but Traci still hadn't shown up by 9 pm. Worried, I called her apartment and got her machine. We were just beginning to consider our next steps when Traci pulled up. "Sorry I'm late but I needed to talk to Alan and had to wait till after dinner hours to see him. You know, it's such a nice night, why don't we all go for a bike ride? I haven't been on a bike in years and I really miss it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valarie realized what was going on seconds before I did and started digging for a spare helmet for Traci. As she reached for her leathers, I caught the idea and enthusiastically agreed. Within minutes we were screaming off into the night. We slid to a stop in the middle of our field and dropped down to lay in the tall grass.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What I found brings up more questions than it answers. Over the past several years there has been a sporadic trickle of information out of the company. Every so often internal security is alerted and tries to find it. Usually they begin by questioning the directors and division heads. Then they get to Jeff and Jack and invariably then target in on one or two employees. Most of the time the employees are women who have turned Jeff down and who are known or suspected of being sexual minorities of some type. The worst case was two years before I started when the target was a post-op transsexual woman working in weapons development. By the time the smoke cleared she had committed suicide, her husband was in a mental hospital, and their adopted children had been turned over to the state. Two internal security people had died in mysterious accidents and the company head office dropped the investigation. In each case the investigation has been dropped as soon as all leads have been checked. In all cases the missing data was only accessible to a small number of people in this division. There must actually be a leak, just not where everyone ends up looking."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Babe, who has access to your files?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I do, and my team does, why?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What about Jeff or Jack?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"They could certainly get to the machines, but it would be hard for them to gain access, not impossible, just hard. It would fit, but how have they so easily escaped notice?" I stopped suddenly as I caught a faint sound off to our right. In a flash I changed, forgetting Traci in my haste. In moments I was off, tracking the scent on the breeze. A quick pounce dropped the lurker and my roar brought the others running. Valarie questioned him while I periodically made threatening moves and sounds. He babbled rather quickly that he had been hired by a nameless man to track us and record anything we said. His small tape recorder was quickly disposed of. A little more persuasion pried from him the contact point where he would receive his drops. Then we had a big problem, what to do with our watcher. After a lot of debate we decided to have him stay at our place as a guest, at least until we tracked back the next person in the chain. Carefully Traci and Valarie loaded him aboard Valarie's bike and they headed back. I sprinted back taking a short cut and was there waiting for them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We left him in the basement, tied securely to the water pipes. Paranoid that Valarie was she had nothing on Traci who tied him in a way where he could reach nothing that could help him escape. She apologized profusely to him all the while. Then she turned to me, "What the hell are you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valarie and I tried to explain what little we knew. She listened quietly, asking questions every once in a while. "So Alan wasn't crazy after all."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, not entirely...I wish there was some way I could get him out without having to become a lab rat somewhere..." Every time I thought about him it hurt. He wasn't really a bad sort and he didn't deserve to be held for something that wasn't his fault, yet I couldn't figure a way of telling the authorities without trading myself for him. I liked him and all, but I wasn't about to trade places.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The next morning Traci and I headed into work while Valarie called in sick so she could watch the drop. We timed our arrivals to match our usual schedules so Traci was already there when I walked in. Jeff met me at the door flanked by two security guards. "Irendi Walker if you would be so kind as to hand over your keys and security card, you have been relieved of your position. You may now leave. You will receive your back salary and a small severance package. Under the current circumstances I would recommend that you do not leave the area as a full national security council investigation is under way. You are under suspicion of international espionage. Good day Ms. Walker."</p>
