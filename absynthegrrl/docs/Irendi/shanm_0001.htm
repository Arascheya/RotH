<p class="pagecaption">Tearing the Veil</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something bit me two weeks before my first term at Davisson School, a world reknown dance, music and theatre school, located in the Jefferson Centre complex. I was at work, at the organic grocery, and had my hands deep in a bin of produce. A bee buzzed up just after the pain, I didn't think anything about it since I had been stung numerous times before, as I smashed it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty minutes later waves of heat rolled over me and sweat popped out, running down my face and soaking my clothes. Ms. Schultz, dressed in her typical shapeless, flower patterned mumu, stared and said, "You don't look very good, dear. What's the matter?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know," I replied as a wave of dizziness hit. I stumbled into the bakery case I was getting her bread from. She came around, grabbed my arm, and steadied me as I almost fell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let me help you. Mr. Arakov, could you help us to the back?" she helped me walk toward the doors to the back. I was starting to shake by the time we reached the doors. Mr. Arakov, the owner, came in behind us, just as violent cramps doubled me up and dropped me to the cold concrete floor. I fell into blackness as the convulsions started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My ears woke up first to the sounds of a heart monitor, voices in the distance, and paging speakers. Next came smell, disinfectant and cheap food. Vision returned last, blurry and foggy, like waking up with pink eye, where your lids are mostly crusted shut. I tried to reach them with my left hand, but it wouldn't move. My right hand wouldn't move either and panic started to set in. Something was irritating my nose, making it itch and there was a clogged feeling in my throat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A Korean looking woman, in a white coat, came into view as nervousness started to increase into panic. "Ah, you're awake. Please, hold still a minute and let me get the feeding tube out." She carefully pulled a long tube out of my nose and then she untied my right hand. She waited while I scraped away most of the clots and opened my eyes. They didn't track at first. If you remember the really old television sets, the analog ones, they would turn "snowy" and wavery when a station wasn't coming in, that was what my eyes were doing. After much blinking and squinting, I looked at the doctor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm Dr. Kim and I have been attending you. Do you know who you are?" I nodded and managed to whisper my name, through my very dry throat. "Thirsty?" I gave a small nod and she waved at a nurse. A moment later she tipped a few ice chips into my mouth from a small cup. "Do you know what happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, no. I was working with the produce, same kinds as always, I got stung by a bee, but I've been stung before without reacting, then I went over to sell some bakery to a regular..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stung? We found a bite on your left hand, but it wasn't a sting, there was no stinger. There was a bit of irritation, but none of the usual spider toxins in the tissues. What sort of allergies run in your family?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I was adopted when I was a baby and never knew my birth parents. How long have I been here?" I had lost track of how many times I had to explain why my parents looked nothing like me. They were average Meriksans, a little thick with age, but they both turned heads. My features were pure Nehtanese, slightly up-turned almond eyes, long, thin face with very high cheek bones, narrow chin, and a wide mouth. Like everyone, I didn't believe I was beautiful, but I was exotic enough to turn heads and had to turn away the boys that came panting after me. I wasn't comfortable with their attention, it distracted from focusing on dancing and was vaguely disturbing as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Four days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Four days? When can I go home? I have to be at Davisson School on Sunday to check in and start new student orientation and I'm not ready!" I struggled to sit up, but my vision snowed out and dizziness forced me back down. "Ok, not today, I guess." I looked around the room at the wires and tubes attached to me and tried to stay calm. "Any chance some of these attachments can come off?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Some of the monitors can come off. The IV needs to stay in a while longer, until I'm sure you can eat and drink normally. I want to monitor you tonight, make sure you can eat and drink without problems, then move you to a normal room tomorrow. If you are doing well by tomorrow night, I will consider releasing you. I'll check in on you in the morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where are my parents? In the movies, they are sitting with me while I'm in a coma."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They have been allowed to see you, but not to stay. You are in Trauma 3, a special ward for the more exotic cases."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's wrong with me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She hesitated for a long while before speaking, "It's complicated, not because I don't know what happened, but the explanation is going to sound very strange. You're only the second case of this I've seen. A spider bit you, but it wasn't toxic in the usual way. It carries a venom that awakens its victim, strips away the mind's ability to ignore things that don't fit normal perceptions. In one in ten thousand cases a viral contaminant causes a genetic rewrite of the victim. You fell into that percentage and the rewrite caused your convulsions and extreme fever. The conversion runs between two and eight days. The results are varied, however, some things are consistent. That's the easy part." Dr. Kim stopped again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's the hard part? Will I turn into a wolf with the full moon?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, therianthropy isn't transmitted by spiders, or mosquitos either, thankfully. Do you like science fiction or fantasy?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Urban fantasy more than science fiction, but I read and watch both. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then you understand the idea of being able to see things others can't or won't, right?" I nodded. "The rewrite has awakened you to that state. This world contains gates that lead to other places. Doorways to other-wheres that awakened, or aware, beings can use to travel. It is these travelers that you will detect. The dangerous ones will be here to do mischief and they will resent your trying to prevent that. There is a lot more to explain, but the best people to do it are the women running Ezra's Magic Shop. They know a lot more about how this works than I do. Once you are released, I seriously recommend you talk to them. I also recommend you get training in how to fight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What if I don't want it? I mean it's cool and all, just I want to be a dancer, not some shadow fighter. Leave it to people who enjoy that kind of conflict. Every story I know states there is a high price for this kind of ability. What if I'd rather not pay it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The price is your transformation. The choice is always yours, however, don't be surprised if your choice isn't respected. The transformation is not reversible. I seriously recommend talking to the people at Ezra's. Do you know where it is?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Near the original Arakov Market, in the Village, right?" Dr. Kim nodded. "I'll think about it. Where are my parents? When can I go home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm going to keep you overnight. In the morning we will take you to a room in the main hospital and let your parents in to collect you. Now, I'd like you to sleep, so I'm putting you back under for the night. You shouldn't have as much trouble waking up in the morning."</p>
<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">I drifted awake in another room. My eyes opened to grey shadows. Watery light, tinted just the faintest of yellow spilled into the room. Everywhere the shadows were deep and rich, layered into multiple shades of grey and black. Dim red eyes flickered in them. My mom and dad were sitting next to the bed, as grey as the rest of the surroundings. Dr. Kim was telling them I should be awake in moments. She was in full color. Panic settled in as the drugs faded further. Dr. Kim rushed everyone out when I struggled to speak, unable to get much more out than, "Wha, wha's happening? Oh gods!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's wrong? Are you ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They're grey. Why is the room grey? Why are my parents grey? Why are you in color? What the hell is going on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I told you that you became a Strange Attractor, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A Strange what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A Strange Attractor, that's what the awakened call those like you. Each Strange gets different abilities and effects. In your case the detecting awakened by color is one of yours. There may be other effects that manifest later. The only consistent side effect is better healing. Trauma 3 was set up for Awakened. The rest of the hospital wasn't. Obviously I am an awakened. Your parents wouldn't be. Can I let them back in? You scared them pretty badly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not yet. I can't go around color blind. Can you do anything about this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Not really, no. Maybe they have something at Ezra's, but there's nothing I can do medically to fix you. I wouldn't tell your parents."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't tell you parents what's going on, not even the color blindness, not until you talk to the Bishop sisters at Ezra's. They might be able to give you something so you can see, and that would be hard to explain. As for the rest, you might Awaken them, but more likely they'd think you suffered brain damage from your illness."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fuck, ok. Let them in," I said with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She went to the door, opened it, and said, "She should be ok now. Just a bad reaction to coming out from under the meds we've been giving her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My mom slowly approached, leaned in, and carefully hugged me around all the attachments. My mother and father took turns telling me what had been happening during the last few days.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you been taking care of yourselves?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can always take care of ourselves. It's you we've been worried about!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm in good hands here. I know you want to be here for me and I appreciate it, but it's ok for you to take care of yourself as well. You don't have to stay here for me all the time. I'm not that good of company anyway, being tired, sore, and uncomfortable."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My dad turned to Dr. Kim and asked, "When can we take her home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tomorrow. I would like one more night to make sure the meds don't cause any more trouble and to make sure there aren't any unexpected after effects of her illness."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talia would like to see you, when you are up for it," mom added. She hesitated before saying, "You know that girl has a serious crush on you, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talia? You're kidding, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, very serious. She only leaves the waiting area for work, or when we kick her out to get some sleep. You should be careful not to hurt her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She told you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not directly, but the way she was asking about you, the shattered but hopeful look on her face in the waiting areas, and that she is here every moment she can be, told me. I know your thoughts on relationships right now, but try to be kind, I really like her. Should I let her know you'd be ok seeing her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, you can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mom dialed her phone and talked a few minutes before saying, "She'll be here this afternoon, after her shift."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could take off this afternoon, let Talia keep me company for a little bit, then they'll probably put me to sleep early this evening anyway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure? We're worried about you, you know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, and I love you and dad for it. I'll be ok today and I'll see you in the morning, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She nodded slowly and went to the door. Just after they took away my lunch tray Talia bounded in, "Hey, how are you doing? You going to be ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm..." my voice trailed off as I saw her. She was in full color, but the face I knew was flickering and fuzzing, like a scifi movie bad holographic effect over the top of another face.  She was average height, with light blonde hair, and freckle covered pale skin. She would have been pretty if she would dress in things other than ratty hand me downs from her brothers, would take an interest in the state of her hair, and would lose the thick rimmed black plastic glasses. I had tried a few times to talk to her about it, being no stranger to the usefulness of exotic beauty myself, but she had no interest. Slowly the face I knew faded into a different face, darker, more angular, with bone white hair and small horns poking up through it, emerald eyes with cat pupils instead of round ones. Her teeth were sharper and whiter, her cheek bones higher and more pronounced, and she was a lot more muscular than I had thought.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shan, are you ok? Why are you staring at me?" Talia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm just so happy to see you," I replied quickly, unsure what else to say. Her face lit up with a wide smile as she replied, "I'm very glad you are ok. I don't like hospitals or seeing my l...," it was Talia's turn to stumble over her words, "friends in them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We talked for a the rest of the afternoon and through dinner, then Dr. Kim came in. "Ms. Mason needs her rest. You can come back in the morning when her parents come to take her home."</p>
<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">I woke slowly to Dr. Kim watching from near the bed. "How are you this morning?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Still seeing in black and white, but otherwise ok, I think."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Try slowly standing and let me know if there is dizziness, nausea, or extreme weakness. You'll be a bit unsteady from being in bed for four days, but you should be able to stand and walk slowly." I eased myself out of bed, gripped the rail for a moment as I waited for my balance to settle, then slowly walked around the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Things seem ok," I replied after a few minutes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good! I'll let your parents know they can get you after lunch."</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">When my parents came, I was wheeled to a cab. I had wanted to walk, but the nurses insisted I use the wheel chair. The ride home was difficult, trying to pretend nothing was wrong while looking at a grey world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dad ordered in my favorite foods for dinner and we sat and talked about what had happened. I could tell they were frustrated that I didn't know more. Mom would tear up when she thought I wasn't looking. After a long silence my dad asked if I was going to keep working at the market near our place. When I said yes, he got even more quiet. "Look, I could have been bitten anywhere. It wasn't the Arakov's fault. I was planning to see him tomorrow and see when I could start up again. I want to contribute to my school costs," I told him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I understand that, but we aren't so poor that we can't fund school. We want you to focus on learning, so you can get the best possible jobs when you are done. Besides, didn't the orientation letters tell you to avoid commitments outside Davisson and focus on your studies? Everyone agrees you could easily be a lead dancer almost anywhere, even now. If you pick up some business schooling on the side, you can run your own company or dance related business if anything happens to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I just don't want to feel like a parasite and I like Talia's family and helping them out. I'll let him know about the school recommendations."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please, just be careful," my mom added. "You have no idea how hard it is to see you lying on a bed, in an isolation chamber, wondering if you are going to live or die. I don't want to see that again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The evening was long and awkward, with everyone heading off to bed as soon as was possible.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">The next morning they hovered around me as they got ready to go off to their days. I suffered through it, acting as cheerful as I could, until they finally left. Once they were gone I threw on clothes and headed for the subway. Reading the signs and arrows was much harder without the color coding that made the process easy. Nothing was too strange until I started walking toward the market from the W 4 St. station. All the buildings on the east side of 6th were in color, everything to the west wasn't. As I turned the corner onto Waverly the color hit me like a wave. Everything was in hyper-color, over-saturated, like a photograph were the color is pushed hard. It beat on my eyes until I had a roaring headache by the time I was in front of Ezra's Magic Shop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The windows were lined with magic kits, simple tricks, and novelties. Inside the front area was cluttered with shelves of more. The further into the shop I went the more esoteric things became. The easy kid's party tricks were replaced with books on magic, rolled up blue prints for old trick apparatus that were no longer considered secret. At the very back I thought I had stepped into an old style apothecary shop. Bottles of powders, potions, and indescribable things cluttered high shelves. A worn counter sat on a glass case filled with various knives, mortars, pestles, and other herbalist gear. As I was trying to read some of the labels, the bead curtain between two tall shelves parted and a woman dressed in movie gypsy clothes walked in. She was my height with black hair, dark brown eyes, and an Eastern European face. "Oh, hello. I thought someone came in. How may I help you?" she asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um, hi, um, I, uh, Dr. Kim says hi," I stammered out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you be Kilashandra Mason, then? I'm Olivia Bishop, one of the owners. Dr. Kim said you might stop by. Let me make sure we won't be disturbed, then we can go upstairs and talk." She hurried to the front of the store, then came back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about customers?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The ones we care about will come again, the others, well, there aren't that many anyway." She motioned me to precede her through the curtain. It led into a standard stock room, with a stairway up the left side. Upstairs was a richly appointed sitting room, done in movie style gypsy colors and patterns. Light streamed in through the large front windows. "Please, sit. Now what can I do for you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I settled slowly into the large armchair. It enfolded me perfectly, the most comfortable chair I had ever sat in. "Can you tell me what is going on? What is a Strange Attractor? Can you tell me why I see most of the world in grey scale? Do you have something for a raging headache as well? Your street is in hyper-color and it's too much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The grey scale is easy. Awakening changes everyone in some way. I think we have something that can help with that. There'll still be a difference between multi-versal things and single realm ones, but it should bring most of it back. Give me a moment to get a couple of possibilities." She went back down the stairs, returning several minutes later with a hand full of various items. "Ok, hold each of these and see which one works best. You want something that lets you concentrate easily to turn off the effect, but that knocks it back enough that you can function and that restores most of the color. It's ok if you want to go back a block, outside this enclave of awakened. Keep them all in this silk cloth and only touch the one you are testing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I returned a few minutes later, after testing all of the items, pointed at two, and said, "The first one gives the best color. The second one is the easiest to switch with, but the color isn't as good. Problem is, how do I wear any of these while dancing? I start the Davisson dance program this Sunday."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can make you ear studs that combine the best properties of your two picks. They should be ready by the end of the week."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How much will I owe you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can work out something you can afford. Now, on to multi-verse 101, or how the true world works. First, some terms. A multi-verse is the collection of all things that comprise current creation. Within the multi-verse are worlds. Worlds are places that contain various races, beings, and circumstances. Each world contains one or more realms. Realms are single instances of beings and things. For example, you are a single instance of all possible Kilashandra Mason's in all the realms forming the world you call "Earth". There are ways to travel through the multi-verse. This realm started to explore space, that is a simple travel method, but a valid one. It takes longer and is more limited than other ways. Hyperspace or warp or whatever you want to call faster than light travel is better, but still limited in how many realms can be touched. Then there are Gates. Gates come in two basic styles, World Gates, and Web Gates. Gates don't open onto every realm either, but they can be artificially created on an as-needed basis using basic research and powerful technology or magic. Then there are various magical constructs and artifacts, as well as some beings with natural travel powers. The reality is even more complicated than this simple explanation, but this gets the basics across. Does it make sense so far?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, I don't know. Seems a bit like an urban fantasy novel or some new-agey pablum more than reality."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Olivia laughed. "New age has nothing to do with reality, any more than any belief system. Beliefs are about how you want things to be, whether it is real or not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did Dr. Kim mention anything about me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean that you are a Strange Attractor? Yes, she did. Stranges deal with Gate Leak, for want of a better term. There is a group that goes from realm to realm securing the permanent gates to keep the worst things out, but the seals aren't perfect. The only way to completely seal a permanent gate is to destroy it, and that is a very difficult task indeed. As a Strange Attractor you are attuned to the gates of your realm. When nasty things come through, you work to suppress them. You will be drawn to them and they will be drawn to you. My sister, Mira, and I can help you with any magic you might have acquired through your change, however, I would strongly recommend you talk to Martin Esterhaaz about fighting training as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Magic I might have picked up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She must have seen the skepticism in my eyes as she replied, "Yes, magic. Not illusion like the kits we sell at the front of the store, but real magic. Real magic is like any other technology. It is a way of manipulating matter and energy to get desired results. It can be studied, learned, and expanded upon, just like any other technology. Most Stranges have magic abilities in one form or another. We can help you determine what form yours takes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hold on, I don't want to fight, or learn magic, or anything else. I just want to go back to my life as a dancer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm afraid it isn't that simple. Once you are awakened, there's no 'un-awakening' possible. I respect your desire not to fight, but the multi-verse may not give you a choice. I will, however. Just remember, we are here in case you need us. This was a lot to take in. Do you have any questions?" she asked as she handed me a card. "This is my private number. Call or stop in when you have more questions. Would you like to borrow these two items until the end of the week? I know what their spells are, so I can make your studs without needing them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I would. May I stay here for a bit and see if the headache will calm down?" She nodded and I remained for another half hour. We talked about random things off and on between pleasant silences.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During one of them, I used my phone to check the work schedules at the nearby Arakov Market. I wasn't sure what I was going to say to Talia after the hospital stay and wanted to be sure she was working at another store. Satisfied, I finally stood and made my exit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Out on the street the colors were back to almost normal as I strode the short distance to the market. Mr. Arakov understood when I explained about school and schedules, reassuring me that I could always return to work when things settled down. He also apologized profusely for what happened. I kept reassuring him that he wasn't at fault. If he had one weakness, it was that he tended to be nice, even when a bit of hardness would help.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I made it home later than I had planned, but still long before my parents did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">School started in a whirlwind right after dorm check-in. Orientation was intense immersion and classes continued the pressure. The semester flew by in a haze of dance, academics, and student projects. Dorm life was difficult at first. I had never lived with other people so closely before. There were many things I had to adjust to, from the periodic wait for one of our bathrooms, to cleaning chores, to how not to trip over the others. It would have been harder if each of us hadn't been so busy. Many nights it was return to the rooms and fall into bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Each dorm suite had five bed rooms, two and a half baths, and a common area. Three were double rooms and two were singles, for returning upper class students. Marta, my bedroom mate, and I had been corresponding through the summer, ever since our housing assignments. It made moving in with her easier. She was a nervous sort, with half of her questions being about what Yew Nork was like, if there was a lt of crime, and other uneasy questions. She was a drama student, and that summed up her first days. I found her sticking close to me for every part of orientation, except when we had to be with our own division. I think she would have dropped out right away, if it hadn't been for the calm of the orientation leader and my efforts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta was thin, to the point of waifish, with wide eyes, in a long face,framed with dishwater blonde hair. I liked her, even as she shadowed me. Her confidence increased a bit once classes began and more structure was introduced to her life. She didn't see it, but she was an excellent actress, scoring the covetted role of the nurse in Romeo and Juliet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta talked me into participating in Romeo and Juliet, as one of the crowd and dancers at the party. It was fun, although, the drama between actors was even worse than the drama between dancers. Marta was adept at slipping past the ego wars, although she couldn't see it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was mid October and we had finished the last performance of Romeo and Juliet. Marta and I were heading down my shortcut out of the theatre. I would leave through the theatre loading dock, walk down the driveway, and to the street beyond. From there, it was easy to slip into the side entrance to the Tyler building and up to our dorm room. I had missed Marta in the dressing rooms, so was 20 meters behind her when a strange patch of darkness caught my eye. It was forming almost under the light mid way down the drive, coalescing into a solid figure, appearing slightly behind her. I didn't think about it, just ran after Marta, slamming into the figure as it was about to reach out and grab her. "Run!" I yelled as the figure spun at me, stabbing its hand into my side. Pain exploded and I staggered back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It shoved me down, leaned over, and hissed, "I will taste your sweetness later, my pretty." What I saw up close was terrifying. It was impossibly thin, tall, with a sharp twisted face. Long claws protruded from stubby fingers. A long tongue snaked out, tasting the air, like a lizard or snake. Its eyes were flat black and dead looking and its breath smelled like rotting blood.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shan," Marta called weakly, turning and starting back toward me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Run Marta, run!" I screamed at her, although pain turned it into a hissing whisper instead. The figure rose, turned, and started toward her. I reached out and locked my hands on its legs. The claws slashed down, carving tracks across the right side of my face. Blood half blinded me and my grip started to slip. It twisted and got loose. Marta was running for the street and the terror was turning to give chase. "No!" I hissed as I pulled my legs under me and shoved myself up and at the thing. It started to spin back, sinking its claws in my side again. I shoved my hands against its chest and hissed "No!" again. Pain, rage, and terror fueled a white hot explosion in my hands. I saw magenta streamers sizzle through its chest, vaporizing a trail across it. The body fell in two pieces and fizzed away into thin oily smoke. I dropped to my knees and then face down into the alley.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Once more I woke to hospital noises and smells. I opened my eyes and pawed at them, trying to get them to clear. Bandages around my right eye interfered with much of the view. My mom was sitting at my bedside again, pale and washed out with worry. I wasn't really surprised when Dr. Kim walked in a few minutes later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What were you thinking, running into trouble like that?" my mom asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I couldn't stand back and watch. There wouldn't have been time to get security."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She half smiled, half grimaced and shook her head. "Do you have any idea how fortunate you were? Just a fraction of an inch and they would have been frantically trying to fix your insides. As it is, there will likely be scars from the ragged knife wounds you had."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My eyes widened in surprise and I started to say something until Dr. Kim barely shook her head. "I know, but I couldn't let it, him, get to Marta. Did they catch him?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no they didn't," my mom replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's a police detective who would like to speak with you when you are ready. She would like to get a statement while events are fresh in your memory. Your dorm mates are out there, too, waiting for word. They can come in, one at a time, if you and your parents agree," Dr. Kim added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, I can talk to the detective, if you think I'm not too drugged up. I'd like to see my friends after the detective."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you feel coherent? If so, you're probably ok," Dr. Kim replied. She poked her head out the door and motioned to someone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hello, I'm Detective Bishop." She stopped and looked at my mom a moment, "Ms.Mason, how are you? I haven't seen you since the museum problem a few years ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm fine, Detective Bishop. All's quiet at the museum these days, thanks. I know you will get to the bottom of this attack on my daughter."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May I have a few moments alone with her to go over what happened?" She was tall and slender, with dark black hair, dark eyes, and a faint accent, making her seem very familiar. My mom and Dr. Kim looked at me. I shrugged and nodded. Once they had stepped out of the room, Detective Bishop pulled a small recorder from her pocket and asked, "Mind if I record this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can record us," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She switched it on, placed it on the small table near my bed, and said, "It's not really a recorder. It's a sound damper, in case someone outside gets too curious." The detective pulled out a sketch pad and flipped it open to a page, then turned it so I could see it. "Is this what attacked you?" On the pad was a sketch almost perfectly mirroring the tall, thin creature that had attacked me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There have been witnesses to previous attacks and the damage done to you matches that done to the other victims. What did you do to it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you think I did something?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you hadn't, you and Ms. Coseco would be in the morgue."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How is Marta?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Physically, she is fine. Otherwise, she's very confused, at least that's what we've let her believe. Her mind doesn't want to accept what she saw. Dr. Kim's team have been subtly suggesting she doesn't remember well from the trauma. I think they are going to release her today."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was more seriously injured than I am feeling right now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You will have to ask Dr. Kim about that. Now, what did you do to it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's going on here? Who are you, really?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am Detective Nikki Bishop with YNPD," she fished her badge out and showed it to me. "I am also Olivia Bishop's sister. She told me there was a new Strange in town. I was going to contact you, but she said to leave you alone, something about choices you wanted to make. Can you tell me what you did?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I dissipated it, somehow. Something I did caused it to dissolve into black vapor and drift away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. It was attacking Marta and I was fading out. I screamed at it, grabbed it, shoved at it and somewhere during that violet light flashed from my hands and, and, vaporized its chest. Oh gods, I killed it. I killed something." I stared at my hands, for a moment seeing it happening in my memory.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You actually might have. Congratulations, those things are very hard to put down. The thing you killed was a Yelgezeth. It is a feeder for a Belgezyeleth, a nasty fear sucking over-demon. I won't burden you with details just now, since we shouldn't take a lot of time. You can come to One Police Plaza and talk to me if you'd like more information. Ask for me and someone will show you to my office. Here is my card with my private number on the back. Call me any time. You can also call my sisters, their numbers are on the card as well. Don't try to do this alone. You aren't invulnerable, or a super being, even as a Strange."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective," she paused, her finger almost on the button, "are there a lot of awakened? Is there a secret handshake or anything when I see someone that is?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's never been a census done. I know there are quite a few, in pockets, in the city. Probably more scattered around. There's no club or anything. It would be like asking someone's sexual preference. You ask when it feels appropriate in your relationship. Now, I really better let your mom back in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just one more question. What really killed the people at the museum three years ago? "</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't what attacked you, but it wasn't human either. We found it and neutralized it, but couldn't release that fact. We had to use the 'the perpetrator must have been incarcerated for some other crime' line for the official story."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, you can let them back in." She switched off the device, placed it back in her pocket, and left the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My mom and Dr. Kim came back in. My mom sat by the bed, holding my hand, while Dr. Kim checked various things. "You should be able to go home tomorrow. The wounds aren't that serious and I've been dropping the pain med dosage all morning. I'd like one more night to get the drugs out of your system. I'll have your discharge papers ready before noon tomorrow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once Dr.Kim was finished, my dormmates came through, each one asking how I was doing. Bethany thanked me for saving Marta, as well as asking how I was and when I was getting out. Sheri brought dance class notes and a message of concern from Ms.Korikova, the cast iron hard ass that was our basic ballet teacher.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia arrived just after lunch, after the others had gone, laptop bag in hand. "Are you ok? What happened? When did you wake up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm ok, I guess. Everyone says it could have been a lot worse. The cl...knife wounds weren't all that deep or bad. I should be able to go home tomorrow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, um, I want to ask what happened, but if you don't want to talk about it, I won't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't remember a lot," I replied, then told her the very basics of what had happened, leaving out the non-human nature of the attacker.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But where did he hide? I've seen that area, there are no shadows."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stared at her for a long time, thinking about her question and what Detective Bishop had said. "I see you," I said slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, silly, I'm standing right here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I see a different you, white hair with small horns, darker skin with red high-lights. We were attacked by something from beyond, something that created its own shadow, then stepped out of it." Talia stared at me, forcing me to slowly continue, "It started last summer, when I was bitten. I didn't really know then. Everything is grey-scale, except those that are touched by more than this world. I see you, in what I guess is your true form, in living color. My mom is grey, this room is grey, the city beyond the window is grey. Only an item from Ezra's lets me see the normal world with color."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia almost fell into the nearest chair, babbling,  "Oh, wow, that's so cool! You can see though the shell image, see the true me? That shouldn't be possible, even for an Awakened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shell image? What's that? Dr. Kim called me a Strange Attractor..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked! I've never met a Strange before. What's it like? You're like heroes to the rest of us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know what it's like other than the vision thing, and, maybe some type of healing advantage. I should have been dead when the emergency team arrived." Talia turned pale at that.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can tell you what I know about being awake, but later, after you get home, come to my place and I'll tell you. I don't feel safe talking about things like that here." She rose and grabbed my hands in hers, "Look, there's beauty beyond the veil too. I can show you the Mirror Souk and the Village as I see it. Maybe I can even show you Sphere. Sphere will blow you mind!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia sat on the edge of the bed, her hands still holding mine. "So, you missed the most awesome and weird news," her green, cat pupiled eyes were sparkling with excitement, "CyCore Games is being taken over by Rani Corp and the mega-corp is funding their next MMO, Realms of the Hut, scheduled for four years from now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"CyCore? Oh, right Conflict for Mars and the Shadow Journey series. Rani Corp, isn't that the mega-corp that took on the government a few years ago over privacy concerns?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, they sent out the encryption systems and instructions to all their subscribers and refused to give the governemnt agencies access to the keys, code, and data traffic. Said they'd have to provide warrants for any snooping and that they would only support it on a case by case, person by person, basis. Pretty ballsy of them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Worked though. So what's the new MMO about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here, take a look," Talia answered as she flipped her laptop so I could see the announcement.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">CyCore Games, creator of 'Conflict for Mars' and the Shadow Journeys series, announces development of a new massively multi-player online role playing game for personal computers and gaming stations. Taking place in the multi-verse, 'The Realms of the Hut' places the players in the conflicts between the powers and forces conspiring to dominate the known worlds.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In The Realms of the Hut, anything could be true. Portals between worlds can be found anywhere. Enemies and allies lurk everywhere, in the depths of the Abyss, in the groves of the Elysian Fields, and monsters really do hide under the bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Journey alone or join forces with your friends and seek out the truths behind the myths, battle the forces seeking power, rise to rule your own regions, and create your own legends. The fate of the multi-verse is in your hands.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">For more information see roth.cycore.com.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now here's the really cool part. Check out this email I got after signing up on the site." She opened the email, scrolled rapidly past the part where she was welcomed to the forums and clicked on a link at the bottom. An image came up in a browser of a heart shaped stone, a rock shadowing it, and a sun in the background. The rest of the image was a dry desert scene. Talia dragged the stone into the sun and a new screen opened, showing an eight sided room with a boarded over door in every other wall. The other four walls were floor to ceiling shelves of books. In the center was a small table with an oil lamp burning. Its glow was the only light in the room. There was a small cloth bound book on the table, next to the lamp, and an age darkened, soot streaked bell hanging from the ceiling. A wooden mallet was hanging next to it. "This is as far as I have gotten," she said, clicking on the book and opening it to the first page.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Realms of the Hut takes place across a multiverse of worlds. On every world there are nexus events occurring between the polarities of all races. These polarities include Law, Order, Chaos, Anarchy, Good, Evil, Light, and Dark. Each player will choose their own ethos and beliefs and these will evolve over time as they explore more of the Realms around them.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">While the choice of Polarity can seem obvious at the first, it is important to remember the multiverse suffers as much under too much Law as too much Anarchy, too much Good as too much Evil. Because of this, there is a last group, working from the shadows, to prevent the multiverse from tearing itself apart. These are the Keepers of the Balance. The exact ways in which Keepers are recruited is not known, only that some are called and few accept.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Within the Realms of the Hut your character's actions will change the face of destiny across the multiverse. There will be epic battles between the various Polarities as each group strives for supremacy. Sometimes the fate of the many depends on the actions of the few. You have the chance to be one of the few and carve your fame across the ages.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's possible to look around the room," Talia moved her hand in the control glove she always wore and the view shifted, as if actually walking around the room. "There are other books on the shelves, but they are ghostly and not useable. You can ring the bell, but nothing..." she broke off as a deep bell tone rolled through the room. "It hasn't done that before." A white shape flickered briefly near the table and then a scrap of parchment dropped on it. Talia picked it up and an insert graphic opened up, showing text and a flashing cursor over a line. The text said, "A rose red city half as old as time" and a small arrow pointing at the blank line.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I reached out and typed "Patrea" even before I said it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you know that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The line was pirated by a Mars novel I read when I was really young. For some reason the phrase stuck. Years later I found out it referenced the capital and trade center of the Zeltaarans." A chime sounded and as it faded a cloth bound book materialized on the table. Talia flipped it open to show a page partially filled with text, neatly hand-written in ink.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Notes of Irena Katarya</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Statics</p>

<p class="regtxt12">A woman once asked me, "Don't you want to settle down, raise a family, become a part of a community?"</p>

<p class="regtxt12">All I could think was, "Only in my worst nightmares. To be ground bound, stuck on some gods forsaken rock, would be a hell from which I would run screaming. I embraced the Hut of All Worlds, the Hut of Margla Fleshfeaster. I reveled in the knowledge that I could go anywhere and any when, and never have I regretted the price of admission."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia and I looked at each other. "On the game web site, where I signed up for the forums and announcements, CyCore announced there would be before launch puzzles and games to generate interest. I was surprised they had a starting event ready with the first emails."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We talked about things at the store, we discussed Conflict for Mars and other games until Dr. Kim and a nurse came in with dinner. Talia dropped my hands like she had been burnt. I grabbed one of her hands and held it until I was sure she knew I was ok with other people seeing it. She smiled shyly as I gave it a gentle squeeze and relaxed my hold.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm about to go off shift, but I need to talk to you first. Would you mind if I stay and talk while you eat?" she looked pointedly at Talia, then at me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I'd like that. It's ok, Talia knows about things. She can stay while we talk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ahzyashteahmzi Ikztuathtea," Talia added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dr. Kim looked momentarily startled, the replied, "And I honor you as well, Gate Born. Shan, you should know that you will heal from most things on your own, and rather quickly. This is common for a Strange. You won't be immortal, massive damage or debilitating illness can still kill you, but this should help keep you alive. It's why you were mostly healed before you arrived here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, what doI tell my parents and people at school? People don't heal this fast."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ideally, nothing. Telling the un-awakened about the Veil Between Worlds is never a good idea. Many people would rather believe the world doesn't have things from Beyond the Veil and their minds will rationalize away a great many oddities. In the end, it is a personal decision based on trust, comfort, and knowing if it will make their lives harder or better. You also need to determine if they are more likely to believe you or consider you dangerously crazy. If you don't want to tell them, I can show you how to change the bandages and make it look like it's taking the usual time to heal. You might want a safe place to stay next time you are injured, somewhere your parents wouldn't be called and wouldn't worry if you didn't come home while you heal."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Monday morning Ms Korikova stopped me as I was headed to the locker room, before her class. She was the head of the dance department and the first year ballet instructor. She was also very severe, never smiling, always correcting, and very curt in her speech. "Mason, a word, my office." I followed slowly, trying to keep my nerves under control. Ms.Korikova only invited people to her office if they were in serious trouble. "Slowly, basic form one." I complied while she watched closely. "You are fit to dance today. The stories made it sound as if you were more seriously injured. You may get ready now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Classes were very hard. I had thought I had recovered, but my body was still very tired. I staggered back to my room and fell onto my bunk, mostly asleep before my head settled into the pillow. I half woke up to the door opening when Marta came in much later. I heard her go to her desk, then to the window. When I openned my eyes, she was staring out the window. After a few minutes she moved closer to the bunks and quietly asked, "Shan, are you asleep?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wanted to talk about, you know, what happened to us Saturday night. I want to thank you for saving my life. Most people would have run or tried to call security. You dashed right in and stopped him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm just glad he ran away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But he didn't. There was so much blood. I saw you fight with it. It wasn't human and you were bleeding to death after you destroyed it. At the hospital, they told me I was confused and I let them believe I was, but I know what I saw."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want me to say?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want you to tell me what really happened. Look, I know they were trying to protect me. When I was really young, I lived where magic was considered normal. I saw strange things, ghosts, monsters in the shadows, and nobody thought it was weird. School, as well as a move to a big city, taught me to never talk about what I saw, but you see it too, don't you? The world beyond our world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hesitated a very long time before I said, "Yes." Softly I muttered, "We revert to our level of training."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's something I heard once. Not sure it makes sense, though. I haven't been trained, but I saw it going for you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I haven't looked into the shadows for so long that I didn't see it at first. Do you look, or have you never had to forget what you can do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't completely turn it off. It's confusing sometimes. Especially in places like this, where there are echoes of everyone who's studied and worried here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She looked around and finally nodded, "I can just make them out, if I concentrate really hard." She remained silent for a while, then blurted out, "How can you look so good today? You, you were face down in a pool of blood after the attack. How could they release you yesterday?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stood and crossed to the window, staring out at the Jefferson Centre spread out below us. Marta slowly moved up to stand next to me and waited. I tried to think of something to explain, without explaining everything. At last I gave up and said, "I was bitten by something and awakened just before new student orientation. It almost killed me, but when it was over, I could see into the shadows. There are side-effects. I only see this world in black and white without the magic in these." I pointed to my earrings, then continued, "I started healing very fast afterward. It seems I can use magic as well, but I don't really know what it can do yet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We stood, staring out at the world around us, lost in our own thoughts. She finally turned, stripped, and pulledon her pajamas. "It's been a long few days. I'm going to bed now. Thank you for not telling me I'm crazy. One last question, why the bandages?" she asked as she climbed up into her bunk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How would I explain how fast I healed?" I replied, stripping, changing into the large shirt I slept in, and falling back into my bunk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Things stayed quiet until the afternoon of Wodnesday. Detective Bishop was talking to Ms. Korikova and motioned me over. Ms. Korikova stalked off as I approached. "I need you to come with me. I need your help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have class now. Can't this wait?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm tracking another of the things that almost killed you. If we wait, more people will be hurt. You tell me, can this wait?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, let's go," I replied. I hurried after her as she headed for a police cruiser waiting outside. "What did you tell Ms. Korikova?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That we might have found your attacker." We rode along in silence until we reached Police Plaza, where she conducted me inside. We passed through a door labeled "Section 13 - Violent Crime Victims Unit". She led me to a spacious, but spartan office with her name on the door and pointed at a chair. "I should clear up a few things before we get started. The front offices actually deal with victims of exceptionally brutal crimes. The rest of us deal with Veil Events. Officially we don't exist, unofficially, we are called in any time something strange occurs. Our funding comes through a smoke-screened section of the general fund. I would like to attach you as a paid consultant. The salary wouldn't be extravagant, but should give you options. The work you will be called upon to do will interfere with regular employment, I'm sorry to say."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute, I haven't agreed to any of this. All I've ever wanted to do was dance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sometimes decisions get made because most of the options are too terrible to contemplate rather than because the best choice is what we want. I became a police officer because my best friend, and roommate at university, was ritually raped and murdered. Most of us knew who had done it, but one of the suspects was a campus security guard and his father was the dean. They were also from beyond the veil. I dropped my degree in architecture to take up police work, with the intent that I would never be powerless against those type of people again. You can try to be a dancer, but you could be so much more. As a Strange, you are in a position to reduce suffering and keep your friends safe. The reality is things will come for you, regardless of whether you are prepared for them or not. Fighting back will keep you alive to dance and keep your friends alive too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't have time to argue you into this. I need your help to keep people from dying. If you can't be bothered, fine, walk out, but I won't help you in the future, even if I could."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I..." I thought about leaving until I remembered Marta and the thing ready to feed on her, just because she was there. "What do I have to do?" I asked with resignation in my voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Look these over and sign these forms. They are basic tax reporting, citizenship verification, and salary data. You can look over the benefits forms, talk to HR if they are too confusing, and turn them in by the end of the week." She was right, the forms were amazingly clear for employment papers, but the benefits ones were full of options.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute, is this right, job classification is detective?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. It slows down the territorial pissing when you're at a scene with officers that aren't from the ghost precinct, section thirteen. Now, the real reason I came and grabbed you is we have more information on your attack. There is only one Belgezyeleth in the city and it is a powerful one, with ten remaining feeders."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, I was going to explain more. Belgezyeleth demons thrive on fear and on control. Control they get by harnessing one or more Yelgezeth sub-demons. These sub-demons feed from living creatures, consuming their fear and draining their life at the same time. They feed the fear to the master and sustain themselves from the bits of life force left over. The Belgezyeleth grows stronger the more the feeders feed it. Status in Belgezyeleth society is based on the number of feeders controlled and the quality of fear extracted. The one in the city is one of the more respected ones. As far as we can tell, the maximum number of feeders a Belgezyeleth can have is twelve, so the one here started with eleven. The relationship is symbiotic so the healthier the master is, the stronger the feeders are. We have killed feeders in the past, from lesser Belgezyeleth, but there has always been a high cost."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You want my help killing the Belgezyeleth?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In the end, yes. Problem is, if you manage to kill the master, it relocates its essence into one of the feeders and regenerates its body. The only way is to kill all the feeders first.  The last four are the hardest. If you try to kill them one at a time, the master jumps back to the demonic realms and recruits more. Sure, it is a social failure in Belgezyeleth society, but the demons are pragmatic enough to deal with it. For now we want to start killing off the excess feeders while we work on a strategy for the last four and the master."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective, oh, sorry, didn't know you were with someone." A slight, stooped man skidded to a halt in the doorway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok, Rick. This is Shan, our new Strange. What do you need?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tracking has lost the Yelgezeth. It dropped completely out of sight, no trace, no shadow-echo, nothing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where was it last detected? Maybe Shan can pick up a trace."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Near Murllan's Pub at the corner of Lafayette and S Elliot Pl."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks, we're on our way. Any regular patrols in the area?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, there were no incidents, just the trackers snagged a signal. It didn't last long enough to know what might have been happening." Detective Bishop was already moving as Rick finished.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the car she said, "There are a few things you really should do for that badge. I don't think you need to go through the entire police academy program, but there are courses you should take. It will help with your cover and make you safer when interacting with officers from other precincts. I would really recommend unarmed combat training as well. Martin Esterhaaz, of the Tiger Dojo, has a good reputation and he is an awakened. The academy courses are for those without your skills. Work on your magic as well. It has saved you once already."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do I go through the academy courses?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I send a request and they slide you into the next class with an opening." She stopped as we pulled up to the bar. It was a small corner bar that had been kept close to its original look, although the huge display screens showing sports ruined the ambiance. Even in the middle of the day it was crowded. I looked around, but nothing leapt out at me. Detective Bishop eyed up the place, then headed to the bar. I trailed along, not quite sure how to act. She settled on an empty bar stool, motioned for me to join her, and ordered two sodas. We sat and listened to the conversations around us, finished our drinks, and left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Maybe a hint of something near the door, but not enough to do anything with. What now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The boring part of police work, reports and research through other sightings. Would you like me to drop you at the school or somewhere else?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At the school. I need to get in some practice time."</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Tharsday afternoon detective Bishop showed up again and dragged me to a seedy, run down laundromat, Bridge Laundry, in the shadow of the Hattmanan Bridge. It was dirty, the equipment rusty, but it was half full of patrons and most of the equipment was in use. We turned right, went down a short flight of stairs into another area, and walked to the back. A nerdy looking girl was sitting behind a desk, typing on a large laptop. She was in black jeans, a white T-shirt, with the "Conflict for Mars" game logo on the front. "Leia, you have a minute?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She held up a finger and continued typing for another few seconds, then said, "Sure Nikki, what's up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anybody talking about the attacks in the bridge park last night?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean the puppet people hit? No, and that's surprising. We don't often see Gladius hits in this part of town."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think it was Gladius Dei. The coroner's report said fighting claws, which isn't their style."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You, new girl, you aren't Gladius Dei, are you? I know their type have infiltrated the police at every level." My look of complete confusion must have reassured her, because she continued, "Don't listen to Nikki. She doesn't want to understand how dangerous the Gladius groupies are. That's why I keep things running in here, even if there aren't many patrons some hours. The noise masks their surveillance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not everything is Gladius Dei, Leia. What do the rumors say?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Someone said it was a black thing of claws and terror, but he reeked so much of wine that I wasn't sure. So, who's the new girl?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Leia Cassini, this is Detective Shan Mason."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Mason, good to meet you. Nikki, be very sure to tell her about Gladius Dei."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come on, Leia, you know they're mostly urban myth. The real Gladius Dei was disbanded years ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Mason, come back sometime and I'll tell you about them. Nikki doesn't want to believe Gladius remains active."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could we get back to the attack? Was that all you heard?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The woman that found him said he was torn up very badly. The responding officers looked bad after seeing the scene. It must have been intended to send a message rather than just a removal hit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok Leia, thanks for your help. We need to go, other cases to look into."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Mason, I'm here most days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, thanks." I waited until we were back in the car before asking, "What was that all about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Leia is a conspiracy nut and a civilian. She sees Gladius Dei everywhere, but she listens to all the rumors because they feed into her obsession. Her information is useful once you learn to filter out the paranoia. I think the attack was another Yelgezeth one from what she said."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, what is Gladius Dei?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was a covert enforcement arm of the Cothloc religion. They answered directly to the Heirophancy and were often the Heirophant's hit squad. They were disbanded in the 1940's after a particularly spectacular series of events they were at the center of. Every so often a church official will use their name as a scare tactic, threatening to have the Heirophant start them up again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds creepy! Should we look at the scene?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, all the impression evidence will be gone after everyone tromped through the area. Back to the school today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was sitting at my desk, staring blnkly at a textbook, when Marta came in. "Hey Shan, want to grab dinner?" I was a bit surprised. She hadn't asked since our first couple of weeks, once our schedules filled up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, cafeteria?" She nodded and we headed down to the third floor. We ate in silence, another oddity, since Marta was usually animated and talkitive.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She didn't really look at me  as she asked, "Shan, what's going on with you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The extemely driven Shan Mason has cut classes two days in a row. Both times the police have dropped you off. What's going on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are more things out there like what attacked us. The police want my help finding them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta stared at me as she finished her meal. "Let's find an empty practice room. I'd like to run some lines." I looked at her in confusion for a second, before I caught up with her meaning, and nodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We started the hunt on our floor, the sixteenth floor, but ended up on the top floor before we found an empty one. Marta started in as soon as the door swung closed. "And why is a police hunt your job? There's more to this than you are telling, isn't there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Bishop is pulling on me because of what I did to save us and because I'm something called a Strange Attractor. I don't even know what that is. It's hard to refuse a request when I can supposedly save lives, but it interferes with my goals here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean, 'and'?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As a child, I saw ghosts, other worldly creatures, and other strange things, but never anyone using magic. My village talked about spirits and rituals, but no one ever dared try any of them. Then you come along and save our lives with magic. Where did you learn? What's it like? Can it be taught?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. Terror and pain triggered it. I don't know if I could manage it again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could. You are different than the rest of us." I couldn't stop the harsh laugh that bubbled up at her words. "You are. You move through Davisson like you own it. Every class, every critique terrifies me. Why do you think I trailed you everywhere those first days? I feel like an imposter here. I come out of critiques shaking and sick, you come out of them without a care in the world. How do you do that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We had to be exceptional to be accepted here. I remind myself of that when things get rough."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's more than that. You are an old soul, far older than you look."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's a laugh. I spent my life dancing, playing video games, and desperately trying to keep my grades up so I could come here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She shook her head and said, "Ok, I understand you don't want to talk about it. Just know that I will listen if you ever do." She rose and started for the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Marta, wait. Look, I feel like I'm going crazy with this stuff. I don't have any answers to your questions. I've seen my share of simulated blood and gore in movies and the regular amounts of ass-hattery in the news, but no more than  anyone else. I can't think of anything that could explain what you see."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Freyday morning came the conversation I had been dreading. I walked into the school and Ms. Korikova was waiting. "Mason, my office, now." She turned, fully expecting I would follow. She started as soon as I had closed the office door. "What is going on with you? You could be one of the greats. You have the raw skill, the drive to learn, and, until this thing with the police, the focus. If you want to be a great dancer, you need to let go of the police thing and focus on dance again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have a chance to find out who attacked us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is in the past. Let it stay there. Worry more about your future."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her words stayed with me all day, banging around against all the other strange things of the week. I made it through my classes, but my rhythm was off, my dancing stiff, and I couldn't focus at all in the lecture class.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I called Marta and left a message as soon as the last class was over, telling her I would be staying at a friend's so the dorm mates wouldn't worry.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The subway ride was hard, trying to stay calm among all the strangers. I stepped into the private areas of the Arakov home, intending to let Mrs. Arakov know I was there. My words died in my throat as I saw her. It was the first time since I had changed and I saw she wasn't human either. She was taller than she usually appeared, her skin glowing a faint lumanescent green. Her hair was ebony, with greenish hilights and it floated and drifted as if in a gentle wind, even though the air in the house was still.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, dear?" Mrs. Arakov asked after I had remained silent for some time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, uh, is it ok if I crash in Talia's room until she gets home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. You should know by now that you don't need to ask."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hurried up the stairs to the top floor, through the common areas, and into Talia's room at the back of the building. Many would think it belonged to a thirteen year old boy with all the science fiction and game posters plastered on the walls. Her gaming console, gaming computer, and large monitor filled her desk. The only non-fan-boy items in the room were her stuffed tiger on the bed and some of the clothes in her closet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I dropped my bag on the floor, kicked off my shoes, yanked the fake bandages off my face and side, and curled up on the bed, clutching the stuffed tiger. The tears I had been holding back trickled out in a steady stream. They never hit the sobbing in agony stage, but they ran constantly until I drifted into an uneasy sleep some time later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia sitting down on the bed woke me. "Shan, are you alright?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her question brought the tears again. "Not really, no," I replied in a choked voice. "I'm lying to everyone, except you and Detective Bishop, about the police and everything else. I can't stand it anymore."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What involvement with the police? I thought you were hunting your attacker." I sat up slowly, stood, picked up my bag, and sat down next to her. After a long hesitation I opened the bag and tossed the detective badge between us, never once looking at her. She picked it up, stared at it, and asked, "Is this real?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah. Detective Bishop has been pulling me out of classes for the last few days. The first time she sprang that on me. She says it will help with the Strange stuff, give me credibility with the other officers, some shit like that. But it doesn't come for free. I'm supposed to attend Police Academy courses and be available whenever there's an incident where my Strange powers could be of use. I've already been on a couple of calls. And I'm lying to myself that I can still be a dancer. That's the worst of it. I can't be one, not the way I planned, not with this hanging over me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you ever have a second plan, if something happened and you couldn't dance?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I was sure I would dance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did you think when you were on the police calls?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. Part of me was mortified. I don't really like or trust cops. Part of me was thrilled with the hunting aspect of what we did."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe you could become the best Strange you can be. What do you think of that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I read somewhere if you hunt monsters you risk becoming one yourself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's what your friends are for, to keep you from becoming too much of a monster. Trust us to help you with that." She stared at me for a couple of minutes. I could see something in her eyes, but I wasn't sure what until she said, "My friend the monster hunter, that is so awesome!" then she leaned in and kissed me. I froze, shocked, surprised, and after a moment's thought, more than a little turned on. Talia recoiled when I froze and started babbling, "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I know you..." I grabbed her head, pulled her close, and kissed her back. "Oh wow!" she said in a breathy voice when we came up for air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We stared at each other for a few moments, then burst into giggles. She reached out her hand and gently traced the scars on my face. There were three almost parallel, slightly jagged, white lines running from just below my right eye down to the line of my jaw. "I know you won't agree, but I'm afraid I find your scars very hot. Show me the others." My face burned a bit as I pulled up my top and let her run her fingers over the slashes in my side, where the thing had stabbed me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia put her hands over mine, where they were holding up the top, and helped me pull it over my head and off. Her mouth sought mine like a hungry predator. I responded in kind and soon the rest of our clothes flew off. I didn't know what I was doing, but Talia obviously had some experience. I followed her lead and did the things I liked to her. Hours later we collapsed on the bed, wrapped in each other's arms, and slowly drifted to sleep. I woke much later, desperately needing to pee. When I came back to bed, I thought I would be freaked out or uncomfortable with what had happened. All I felt was an incredible warm glow looking at Talia sleeping. I slid in close and settled back to sleep.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">My phone woke me at three in the morning. My startled "What the fuck?" woke Talia as I was digging for it. I answered it just before it would have gone to voice mail.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Mason, I need you at a crime scene," Detective Bishop's voice came from the phone. "I'll send a cruiser for you once you tell me where you are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm at a friend's place. I'll be outside the Arakov Market, in the Village, in about ten minutes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A cruiser will be waiting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is what I'm afraid of," I said to a sleepy Talia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She pulled my head down and kissed me with promise. "Go be the monster hunter. Come back to me if it isn't too late. Here, take my keys in case you need to get back in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I dressed, kissed her, and hurried down the stairs. A police cruiser was pulling up just as I reached the street. "Detective Mason?" I nodded as I slid in to the passenger seat. We were moving before I had my belt fastened. There was something exciting about hurrying to a crime scene in a cruiser with the lights and sirens going.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We rolled up to the south entrance of my building. I looked at the officer next to me, "Is this it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, detective. There was a homicide in the south west corner of the top floor, a Mr. and Ms. Fredderson." She pulled up to the curb, stopped the cruiser, and motioned me out. Detective Bishop was waiting at the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come with me." She led the way into the building, flashing her badge at James, the doorman. "Detective Mason is with me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ms. Mason?" James raised his eyebrows as I followed her into the building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Morning James. I know it's strange," I said as I hurried after her to the elevators.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Detective Bishop got us waved through the police line at the door of the apartment. The visuals beyond the door were a little startling, but only because they were real, not set dressing. I almost lost it at the smell, though. That was something the crime dramas rarely showed, the gut punch the stink of old blood, shit, body fluids, and the beginnings of putrefaction would cause. I had to retreat to the hallway for several breaths before I could cope. With the breaths came the cold detachment that helped me in Conflict for Mars.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It had been a violent killing. The couple had been shredded and tossed around the main room. The coroner was just packing up the largest pieces when we entered. The crime scene unit was in place, collecting evidence. I noticed right away they weren't as thorough or meticulous as the crime shows would indicate. There was more raw banter as well, stuff no producer would dare to put in a show.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a time I just watched the various people going about their tasks, idly looking around the room, until a small hint of awakened energy from the dining area caught my attention. Nothing looked out of the ordinary until I turned off the colorizer spells in my earrings. Then it leapt into focus. "It portaled into the dining room, made its way to the bedroom, where it found its targets."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hadn't realized I was muttering out loud until Detective Bishop said, "What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I jerked her way, startled, "Was I talking?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, you were narrating. Please, continue."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, ok. It came in through the dining room," I was looking at the veil energies in little spots throughout the scene. "It knew where to look for the targets. It didn't wander, just went straight to the bedroom." I stepped carefully around the blood and pieces to get to the bedroom. "It pulled her out first. Somehow they were immobilized, so they couldn't struggle." Some weird thing clicked over in my brain and I could taste the residual energies. "Magic. It subdued them with a spell of some kind. Then it took her first, ripping her apart and eating, eating what? Whoa," I muttered, too low for anyone else to hear, as images overlaid themselves over the scene as I described it, fading into full color and detail. It played out in real time then, the entire ghastly affair, thankfully without sound or smell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Phil," Detective Bishop called. "Are there any obvious missing pieces of the bodies?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The coroner stopped at the door and turned, "Yes, the pancreas was missing from both torsos. How did you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ask Detective Mason. She caught it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lucky guess," I called to him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bullshit," he said, without rancor. "You're the new spook, aren't you? Even if you're young."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, Phil, team, this is Detective Shan Mason, the new Strange Attractor for our fair city. I expect you to teach her the ropes and treat her with respect," Detective Bishop answered. "Detective, what else do you have?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It brought the woman out first. Then the man. It ate them at its leisure, taking its time with the dismemberment, nibbling at the most tender muscles before the desert of pancreas. Once it finished, it portaled out from the dining table." I moved to a quiet corner to give the rest of the team room to work.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Detective Bishop came over a few minutes later. "You did quite well. I wasn't sure you'd be able to take it. And that trick of figuring out what happened, our old Strange couldn't have pulled that off." She looked at me carefully for a few seconds, "Have you seen this kind of thing before? Most people get really sick the first few times."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's no more graphic than some of the things my mom and I watch, or a bloody cut-scene in a game. I just pretended I was watching an episode of a crime drama. Well, a crime drama with sense-u-smell added. I always suspected it would smell terrible. Do you ever get used to it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You always notice it, but, with time, you learn to quickly ignore it. Fortunately, the truth isn't as bad as fiction makes it sound. It does get into your clothes, but laundering usually gets it out. It washes off skin and hair with a good shower as well. I'd recommend keeping a spare set of clothes at the precinct so you have something else to change into. Would you recognize the killer from the 'video'?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, do you have a sheet of critter types to look at? It was a Veil Event, the killer wasn't human at all. Kind of a biped with a frog-like mouth and lots of sharp teeth. Hands with two fingers and a thumb, with the smaller two fingers replaced with some type of horn or bone blade. That's what it used for the slicing and dicing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Another trick, remain dispassionate. It sounds cold, but empathizing with the deceased will only make you crazy. It may add dramatic intensity to a show, but it will burn you out fast. Focus on stopping the perpetrator. Let the dead stay dead."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Mason, there's something you might want to see over here," one of the techs called from the kitchen door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I followed her to the kitchen and looked where she pointed. In front of the fridge was a burn mark, shaped like the point of a triangle, extending from under the fridge. "Can we move this?" I asked, pointing at the fridge.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The tech took several photos, dusted the fridge for prints, lifting every one before replying, "We can now." We pulled the fridge out and to the side. Under it was a five pointed star pattern burned into the tile. A circle of symbols was burned in the center of the star. Inside the circle was a broken floor safe. The tech took several more photos, carefully dusted for prints and lifted all the ones she found, then lifted the safe door with a long tool. The safe was empty.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I unfocused and reached out again. Time was hard to determine, but shortly after the killings another being had portaled into the apartment, directly at the entrance to the kitchen. This one was a man in an old coat and shabby clothes who was certain of his destination. He went directly to the fridge, pushed it out of the way, dropped a pebble into the center of the exposed floor, and waited while a flash fire burned itself out, searing the pattern of the protection into place. A short wand shattered the lock on the safe and he extracted the small teak box inside. He left as soon as he was done. I had seen his face before, somewhere, in entirely different circumstances. "Paper," I said to the tech. She handed me a pad and I noted down what I had seen, then said, "Help me look around. There should be a small stone nearby."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She found it, where it had rolled up against a cabinet. It was charred and blackened, but we could make out partial symbols carefully etched into it. It didn't show anything with the colorizer off. We bagged and tagged it and I returned to the main room to tell Detective Bishop what we found. "You see anything else?" she asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I walked the apartment one more time, opening up to everything I could. "No. I think I've found everything I can," I replied when I was done.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok. Next time you come in I'll show you the scene reports you should fill out, instead of notes on a pad. For tonight, this is fine. I can get you back to the precinct, or to another place you'd want to go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My phone showed it was five thirty in the morning. "Back to Arakov Market, where I was picked up."</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">I let myself back in and headed up to Talia's room, slipped in, and stared at her sitting in front of her computer. Flickering light from the monitor reflected off her perfect little horns and white hair. She was dressed in a large T-shirt and a headset with microphone clamped over her ears. She was talking softly into the headset. "Testing complete at the air purifiers. I no longer fall through the wall at twenty seven by four-fifty. Oh, gotta go afk for a bit." She clicked a button on a small controller, pulled off the headset, and turned to me. "Hey, what was it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A murder scene."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No wonder I can smell you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, yeah, could I borrow some clothes and the shower?" I replied as I skinned out of my clothes. She motioned for me to come closer. I crossed to her, expecting her to wrinkle her nose at the whiff of death coming off me. She just smiled. I slid up to her, bent down and kissed her. On my way up I nipped at the base of one of her horns. A move I had learned immediately turns her on. Then I whispered in her ear, "One of us is over-dressed," before returning to nip at her horns.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stood up, using the motion to strip off her shirt, then shoved me back on the bed, leaping on top of me. Just before her mouth clamped onto one of my nipples she hissed, "Shower later, sex now!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Much later she said, "I don't mind the smell. Now, tell me what it was like." I hesitated a very long time, prompting her to say, "I am good with secrets and won't talk about an active investigation. You tell me and I'll tell you a secret."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok," I replied and launched into a description of my night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did you think of your first scene?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was a lot more interesting than I expected. Boring too, at times, but good overall."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Suitable to a monster hunter, such as yourself?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If I can figure out how to actually hunt them, yes. Your turn to show me yours"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We already did that. The secret? You've seen the notice in Conflict for Mars about the Martian Oracles, the players helping players group?" I nodded, having thought about signing up until I thought about the time commitment. "I am the Oracle Priestess, the head of the group, answering only to the CyCore Games Community Support Manager. That's what I was doing when you came in, testing a new area."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, that is really awesome! But you didn't need to stay up for me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It felt right from a solidarity point of view. Besides, I was just a tiny bit worried and very curious. I've never known a police detective before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure you do now. I'm mostly faking it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh-huh, narrating the sequence of events sounds pretty useful to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We talked a bit more and drifted to sleep.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">It was ten in the morning when we woke up again. The sounds of the rest of the Arakov clan drifted up the stairs, along with bacon and french toast. "Here, borrow these, so you don't wear the clothes from last night." Talia tossed me a pair of camo pants and a Brain Eater Deluxe band shirt. They were a bit large on me. She had more curves than I did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We went down stairs holding hands, letting go just before entering the communal dining room on the second floor. The Arakov clan had several family groups living in the four floors above the market. Each family had a section of their own, and then there was a communal kitchen, dining room, and a large room for lounging or watching movies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia's mom looked up as we walked in, "It's about time you were fucking, or should that be about fucking time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mom!" Talia said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, it is. You two have been circling each other since middle school. It's good to see you together."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I sat down, face burning, next to Talia as food was passed around. Meals at the Arakov place were rowdy, chaotic, and full of talk, teasing, and good natured squabbling. Sometimes I wondered what it would have been like to grow up in such an extended family, instead of being the only child of very well to do parents.</p>
<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">I slipped into my apartment just before four. "Is that you Detective Mason?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yes," I answered before my brain processed what my dad had said. 'Oh shit!' my brain silently screamed. I walked slowly into the dining area and stopped at the door. They were both watching me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We heard some interesting stories this morning. First from James, on the door, then from the Hendersons, just down the hall from the Freddersons murder scene. This shouldn't be a place where murders happen. What were you doing there and why was everyone calling you detective?" my father asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Bishop gave me a badge so I wouldn't be questioned if I was at a scene when we were looking for my attacker."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you heal so quickly?" he asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good medical care."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, I'm glad you are better." I could see the shutters closing, even though my answers didn't make much sense. In a few moments he was back to dad, without any worries about me. My mom was not so easily distracted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like to drop my stuff before we eat," I said. My dad just nodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My mom followed me to my room, just as I expected. She barely waited until the door was closed before she started with,"Kilashandra Lakshmi Mason, what is really going on? And don't give me those non-answers you gave your father." She paused just long enough that I was going to say something, then started again, "I've been a consultant. The police wouldn't give you official ID as a consultant. They only do that for actual officers. Your Detective Bishop handles the worst of the worst. She was the officer in charge for the museum murders all those years ago and they were bad. I never believed the official story. I think it was shadow creatures that did it. And people don't heal as fast as you did, great medical care or not. The only things that can heal like that are the shadow beings. Oh, my god, that's it isn't it? You are one of them. I knew we should have researched you better."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come on mom, shadow people, really?" I grabbed her hand, led us to the bed, and sat down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, really. I have seen things at the museum. I won't bore you with the entire list of strange languages and historical anomalies, just the most notable, recent one. Chani Kordetova found the intact tomb of Tyan Hanan, a Tuar't'zani Queen. Not only was she queen, a rare enough occurrence, but she was also lame. She came on the scene in 320 BC, taking the scattered Tuar tribes and welding them into the Tuar't'zani Trading Empire that lasted until very recently. As primary funding agency, and home to a world renown forensic anthropology department, we were given the task of authenticating the find. Almost everything found dated to the correct time. The anomaly was the queen herself. She was in amazing health, with an odd mineral composition in her bones. Minerals that made no sense given where she was and the time in which she lived. She was lame, we could tell from the way the skeleton was worn. She hadn't been in a fall and it wasn't from a birth defect. It was caused by a piece of metal alloy broken off in her lower spine, similar to car or aircraft accident. Nothing of the time could produce the metal, which is similar to aircraft aluminum or titanium, but not the same. Legends say she communed with the gods, then fell back to earth to raise the Tuar up. Tell me I'm crazy, but I don't think she was from here originally."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was a perfect opening, but I couldn't do it. Instead I said, "Are you sure you want to know?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your illness changed you. You used to be afraid of the dark. I'd have to carry you to the bathroom, turning on all the lights as we went. Then you would do the same when you could go on your own. Now you walk through the apartment without turning on a single light and your eyes glow a strange silver in the dark. Please, tell me what is going on."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you certain you want to know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She started to say yes, but paused at something in my eyes, face, or voice, and said, "Why do you ask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Once the veil is torn, you can't stitch it back up and pretend you don't know. I have seen things I wish I hadn't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean the Freddersons murder?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, that was ugly, but expected at a murder scene and after watching too many crime dramas. No, other things, terrible things from the shadows, like what attacked Marta and I. So I ask one last time, are you sure you want to know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She took a deep breath and answered, "Yes, I want to know." I told her everything. She sat silently until I finished, then asked, "Will I see what you see with your silver eyes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I don't know if anyone knows for certain. I hope you won't, not all of it anyway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you thought about what you are going to do, about the police thing, about school, about your dancing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've only started to. Seems I'm another reluctant hero, just like in all the stories."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you reluctant, or just grieving for what the change means? Any great change is a loss of the old, even if the new is sought after. It produces a period of grief and adjustment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hadn't thought of it that way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It helps, trust me, I've been there a few times. We will support whatever decisions you make. We love you and want you to be happy. Just be careful. And know you can always come to me to talk things out." She pulled me into a long hug. I realized how much I had missed these heart-to-heart talks with her. They had been getting farther and farther apart over the years and had stopped after the illness. "If you decide to be part of the police, I will accept it, but I'll worry about you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know yet, but I did like it, the investigation part of last night. Seeing people I know dead wasn't good, but I can help track down who did it. Catching the perpetrator will feel very good."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stopped at the door and turned back, "Can I ask you something, something a bit odd?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you heard of something called Gladius Dei?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've heard the name, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The museum gets a lot of mail from crazies, most of it virulent, but harmless. There are a few that seem very serious, usually coming in clusters, and ranting from a dangerously fanatical religious point of view. Some of them have the symbology of the Gladius Dei. However, Gladius Dei was disbanded years ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What were they?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Historically, they were the personal force of the Cothloc Heirophant. They ran the inquisitions, the urges, and most of the other terrible things the Cothlocs did. We did an exhibit on them ten years ago. The hate mail around it was especially terrifying."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you notified the police?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shar, the director, says the threats aren't serious."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you think they are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something about them worries me. I found out later that we had seen similar threats before the museum murders."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll see if I can find anything out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I left for Leia's place early the next morning. At school I would hear recent arrivals complaining about getting around Yew Nork, but with the transit authority web trip planner and accurate time, it was always simple to get just about anywhere. It took me under an hour to get to the laundromat, far less time than driving and fighting traffic ever would.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia was in the same chair, at the back of the place, still typing on her computer. I could tell she had moved because her top was a Shadow Journeys shirt, showing the Forever City, this time. "Detective Mason, didn't expect to see you so soon."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You caught my interest the other day. I would like to know more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok then, let's talk in a slightly better place," she replied as she closed her laptop, unplugged the power supply, and headed to a small door behind the table. It opened into a tiny room, with a narrow bed, hot plate, and mini fridge. She pulled out her phone, selected an app, and pointed it around the room, then ran it up and down the air around me. "Clean." The bed swung up when she pushed a hidden latch, revealing steep stairs down into a dimly lit tunnel. She motioned me ahead of her, then lowered the bed a precise amount, pushed the latch again, then lowered it the rest of the way. I heard a faint scraping in the distance. We walked about thirty meters, turned left, and walked a few more meters to a narrow stone spiral stairway leading up. At the top was large room with a copper mesh cage in the center of it. Dirty skylights lit it from above. The cage rested on a wooden platform sitting on heavy springs. We went up wooden steps to the cage and Leia pulled them up after us.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia didn't speak until the door was securely latched behind us and she had thrown a large electrical switch. Inside the cage was rack after rack of electronics of types and forms I didn't recognize. A corner held a decent sized bed, trunk, wardrobe, microwave, and fridge. "We can talk here.I sweep daily, so no one can overhear us. What did you want to know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"More about Gladius Dei, but I don't know where you should start."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Like I started to say the other day, Gladius started as the right hand special enforcer squad for the Heirophancy. It officially started in 1160, answered only to the Heirophant, and was officially disbanded in the early 1920s, after a nasty, and very public, event called attention to them. Problem is, they still exist. I have memos, electronic communication, and sightings to verify all this. Nikki doesn't want to believe me because it scares her where these people might be. I know for a fact that YNPD is completely infiltrated by these guys. So are most of the other city administration offices."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is there any way to identify them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sometimes. A few have either a cross or a hand holding a sword tattoo behind an ear or at the base of the hair line. It's not a certainty, though. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My mom thinks they have been threatening people at the Natural History Museum. Do you know what do they want?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean besides power, control, and wealth?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would expect there to be more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, this is going to sound a bit crazy, but, there are people in this world who aren't people. They look like people, but they aren't. They came from elsewhere. I don't know if it's an invasion, an evacuation, or if they are just tourists, but they are here. Gladius wants to kill them, after getting as much power from them as they can. They consider the visitors and anything related to them as threats to the stability and power of the Cothloc church. It is their mission to destroy that threat and anything they consider 'tainted' by it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, yeah, I know, sounds crazy, but it's true. I know where a lot of them hang out. In the West Village, around Washiwa Square and that upscale market. What's it called? What's it called? Oh, yeah, Arachnikov, no, Arakov Market. Anyway, Gladius suspects, but can't figure out how to find them. They want anything old, anything that might have a way to pick out the visitors from the rest of us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tourists? Maybe Nikki was..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've seen them, ok?" she was staring at me all of a sudden. "There's a kind of crackly, shimmery energy around them and if I squint just right, I can see their real form. Just like I can see a shifting pattern of green, gold, and black around you." She started to back away, reaching for a drawer under her desk. "What are you? Did they send you? Do they know what I am, who I am? Why are you here?" She fumbled in the drawer, pulled out a large, ugly pistol and waved it my way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hold on a minute. No one sent me. You asked me here, remember?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That was before, before I saw you were one of them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How can you see? Are you one of them too?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The gun wavered a bit as she seemed to think about it. "You aren't the same. What are you? I'm not one, I know who my parents are and where they came from. Your energy is different, stronger and more focused."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am a Strange Attractor, and before you ask, I don't know very much about what that means."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Strange Attractor, Strange, Attractor, yeah, I guess I could see that. A lot has been written about your kind. Most of it rumor, since none of you ever grant interviews. You die young, are attracted to the worst dangers, and end up fighting for your lives most days. Gladius would like to possess you, or be able to control you, in their quest for power and control. No one knows why the most vile things through the Gates seek you out, but they will. I think it's because they know you will find them and get rid of them. At least I know you aren't Gladius," she ended as she set the gun back in the drawer. "I've never met a Strange before. Do you know if all of you have the same type of aura?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't even know I had one until now. What do you mean 'all of you'? How many are there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's said there are enough of you to cover all the Gates. Thing is, no one is saying how many Gates there really are. Maybe no one knows for certain. What do you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Less than you. Do you know of any way to reliably determine Gladius members? I think there are spies in the Ghost Precinct. Every time we try and track things, they know we're coming before we get to them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it's not as simple as identifying visitors. Gladius auras are like everyone's, all over the place. I know who some are, but only because of digging. Archpriest Dolas of the Cothlocs is one. The Deputy Commissioner of Police is another. The Commissioner is not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should head back. I'd like to talk again, sometime."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That would be good, I'd love to know more about Stranges as you figure it out," she paused, then said, "Look, I love Nikki like a sister, but don't trust all the police you meet. She's a rare gem in a sea of shit. Keep your eyes open and pay attention to everything."</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">"Honey, is that you?" my mom asked when I returned home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, mom." I found her in the kitchen, staring at a cooking video and following along. "I found out a little bit about Gladius, none of it good. They target things related to the veil, considering it abomination, and wanting to destroy or hide it. I don't want to alarm you, but be careful and talk to Shar about the threats. She might want to take them a bit more seriously."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll try. How serious do you think this is?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I'm too new to this to have any idea."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Thoughts and plans bounced around in my head all weekend, but nothing came of it. Monday found me changing for Ms. Korikova's class, just after arriving at school. Something had my nerves on edge, but it wasn't the discussions of the weekend. It grew as I entered the room and started warming up. As Ms. Korikova entered, it peaked in half seen images, drifting just out of the corner of my eye. I spun to see, but only staggered away from the barre. I recovered, but another image shimmered, almost clear this time. I stumbled and fell clumsily into the barre. Ms. Korikova was walking toward me when a clear image of a third floor practice room snapped into place. A dark shadow attacked the woman seated at the piano.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mason," Ms. Korikova began as I sprinted from the room, sliding in the hall on my point shoes, but recovering and dashing for the stairs. She ran after me, trying to get my attention. I ignored her, pushing myself harder as I pounded up the stairs. On the third floor, I skidded to a halt, waiting for a clue to which way. It came in a roiling wave of terror. I spun and ran down the hall to the left, slamming through the door and into the room where a dark figure reached toward a frozen woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey," I yelled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It spun and twisted its features into a gruesome look. "I know you," it said as the woman slid to the floor and toppled to the side. Her face was grey and strained, her mouth open in a silent scream. It sprang and I barely dodged its grasp. It spun and slashed again. This time it connected, ripping a shallow gash across my stomach. I spun and tried to strike. It dodged easily and cackled. "I will have you for what you have done." It slashed again, this time driving through the new scars and into my guts. I staggered back, crashing heavily on the piano bench, and sliding to the floor. It came at me, raised its claws, and prepared to strike again. It whirled when Ms. Korikova kicked it in the back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It dove at her and I dove at it, trying desperately to remember how to call up the magic. Korikova spun away in a fluid whirl. "Do something, Mason. I can't distract it forever." I hauled myself up, blood running down my side, and leaned into the back of the creature. It started to spin, my mind spun frantically, desperately trying to call up the magic. It swung and I tried to blank my mind. Korikova swung again and it turned again. I sucked a deep breath and tried a last time. The magic erupted just as it slashed at her. A purple burst blasted through it just before it connected. It dissipated and Korikova caught me as I fell, easing me to the floor. She handed me her phone and said, "You had better call you detective friend. We need to get you and the other woman out of here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I fumbled to dial the code to Section 13 and described the event, asking for a veil aware med team to come for cleanup. The blood had slowed by the time the call was finished. "They will be here soon. I need to rest a few minutes," I said and leaned my head back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I vaguely heard her ask me something, then a little later I heard Detective Bishop asking, "Were there any witnesses?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, the door was closed and the sound dampening will have kept the other rooms from hearing," Korikova answered. "You could take both of them out as medical emergencies and say they collapsed from stress. I can keep Mason at my home while she recovers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You've done this before," Bishop said. "Why didn't I know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't here. I can tell you later, right now your presence is causing questions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You heard, get me two gurneys up here and a couple of med-techs." I woke up slightly while they were loading me onto a gurney. It was a bumpy ride to the elevator and out to the ambulance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I woke up once again when they were unloading the other victim at the hospital. Korikova helped me sit up and hobble to Detective Bishop's car. Twenty minutes later we were at her building where she helped me stumble to her apartment, and collapse on her couch. I slid into blackness as soon as I landed.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Hours later I drifted awake. Korikova was sitting in an easy chair, reading a book, and watching me. "You're a Strange, a dancer, and a police detective. You are a busy woman."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I knew a Strange once, in Moskava Academy of Dance. We became friends when we started classes together. She was a bit like you, a natural with enough drive for both of us. She wasn't a Strange then, just another dancer. We became best friends and were inseparable, until she got sick. It was a terrible illness, keeping her in hospital for several weeks. When she returned, she was changed. Her focus had shifted, she saw things in the shadows, and she was always running into danger. I pressured her until she told me what was going on. I helped her after that, until she was killed. You need to find a dream that fits with being a Strange. Svetlana never did and I think that's why she died."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My mind was having trouble keeping up with her. I wanted to ask questions, but I couldn't get them to form. "How?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's up to you, but you won't be able to keep your old dreams. Find something that makes you feel good about being a Strange. I'll help if I can. Find friends that you can trust to talk with and to help you. Don't allow yourself to become isolated. You won't survive that. You should rest now, it will help you heal faster. Do you need to call anyone?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I nodded. She handed me my bag, I dug out my phone, called Talia first, then Marta. Her apartment was a small one-bedroom at the top of her building. The shape of the roof could be seen in the corners of the room. Dance posters, photographs, and programs were framed and hung on the walls and were set on small shelves. In most of them, Ms. Korikova was the principal. "How is the other person?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In a place called Trauma 3. No word yet, but still alive thanks to you. You should rest more, if you are anything like Lana. I'll get food while you do," she said as she helped me to her bedroom in a dormer facing Broadway. It was tiny, with just enough room for a small bed, a table, flat screen monitor, and the media player to feed it. A framed photo rested on the table next to the bed, with two young dancers in it. She saw my look, blushed a tiny bit, then said, "Yes, the two of us, shortly before Lana died." There were no other photos that weren't dance related. "Can you get out of your clothes or do you need help?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I started to bend to reach the snaps of my leotard, but the pain from the slashes stopped me. "I need help," I replied, face flaming. She helped without a word and soon she was placing my ruined dance clothes into a plastic bag.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tried to stay awake and form questions, but my body had other ideas. When I woke again it was to the smell of hot food. The light from the window showed it to be after dark, hours after I collapsed. "Ah, you are awake! I have piroshki, hot borscht and bread from the Baba Iaga Ruskala deli downstairs. My family owns it. Have as much as you like." She helped me into a robe and then to her small table. I piled the wonderful tasting food in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You need to learn your magic. If you could have blasted that thing immediately, instead of later, you wouldn't have been hurt."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, but I didn't believe in magic when I came to this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is hard to adapt. The faster you can, though, the more likely you are to live. Remeber this as you do. Many stories call magic black or white. This is not the truth. Magic is like electricity, a force, something without intent. It is the intent and actons of the weilder that determines the tone of the magic that is used." We talked late into the night as I tried to sort out what was happening and she told me stories of things she had seen. She pushed me down onto the couch when my eyes began to droop. "We can talk more later. Now you need sleep." I was going to object, but I fell asleep mid-thought.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">I woke with the dawn, mostly healed and feeling quite a bit better. I was up and fumbling in my bag when she emerged from her room. "What are you doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dressing for school."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not today," she held up her hand, "I know you think you can, and in emergencies, you could. When there isn't an emergency, you should learn to take time for yourself. You will be better after a full day of resting. There's a network connection, wired, with a jack near the table. I'll excuse you for today. I want you to rest and think about everything that has changed in your life. I don't expect you to tell me what you decide, unless you want to, but you do need to seriously think about it. There are a few leftovers in the fridge and energy bars in the cupboard. I will tell my family that you can eat on my account on my way out. We can settle up later. Oh, and you can leave the door unlocked if you are just going to the deli."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When she was gone, I took a quick shower, to wash the last of the blood off, then ate the last of the leftovers. My mind skittered away from her request, so I walked around the tiny apartment, looking at what was there, and what wasn't. Except for the single picture of Ms. Korikova with Svetlana, there were only dance items. It was a sobering thought and it brought my mind back to her task. My life had been simple, I was going to study dance, join a troupe, and work up to principle dancer. Once I was too old to dance, I would retire and become a choreographer. The Arakov enclave was such a different world from what I saw around me. It seethed with interactions and connections, where this was lonely and almost sterile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Three options seemed likely. The solitude of Ms. Korikova's life. The quiet, slightly distant life of my parents, where they went out with friends, but rarely had anyone to our place. Or the chaos of the Arakov family, where people came and went and extended families formed from traditional relationships and deep friendships. I had taken a step toward the second or third option by embracing Talia, but it could easily turn into Ms.Korikova all over again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I settled into her chair and let the last months echo in my mind. I drifted in and out of light sleep, seeing some of the events in nightmares, dreams, and half waking thoughts. Slowly it became clear which path I wanted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When I came fully awake, it was early afternoon. The smells drifting up from the deli downstairs reminded me of how hungry I was. I slipped my shoes on and descended to the street. The main room was half full of people. A woman looking like an older version of Ms. Korikova was standing behind the deli counter. Four women in colorful Ruskala clothing were hurrying between tables and the kitchen in the back. I slid to the counter and said, "Um, Ms. Korikova said I should..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you Shan? Tasha said you might be down." She waved one of the women over, "Nadya, Shan eats with the family. Shan, this is my oldest, Nadya."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nadya practically dragged me into a back area of the kitchen and sat me at the lone table in a back corner. I had a view of two older men cooking, while a younger man and woman helped. "Ivan, my dad, and Uncle Vasili are cooking, my cousins, Ilya and Elena, are helping. Everyone, this is Shan Mason, a friend of Natasha. What would you like?" Nadya asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh," I started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You eat meat?" Ivan asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then you will like the Chicken Kevia. Nadya, we can take care of Ms. Mason. Go help your mom. Welcome to our home! Elena, Get Ms. Mason a kvass, she's an honored guest. Now, how do you know our Natasha?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I gave them the very short version. "Our Natasha is a wonderful woman, but she allows herself no friends, no family, only her dance. I do not understand how she lives. There was a tragedy in her youth and she has closed herself off ever since. It is a surprise she brought you here. She has not befriended students before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come Vasili, it is her choice," Ivan said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am honored she has shared you with me," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ms. Mason, tell us about yourself. Is there only the dance for you, like our Natasha, or is there more?" Ivan asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please, just call me Shan. Ms.Mason makes me feel like I'm my mom. It was only dance until recently. Several friends and circumstances have made me question that. I have an interest in forensic science and history. My mom works at the Museum of Natural History, so it might be more in my blood than I thought. Interestingly, Ms. Korikova was one of the ones suggesting I consider being more." Vasili was starting to say something when Elena set a drink in front of me. I sipped it warily, not sure what it would be, and found it lightly fizzy, a bit bready, and very tasty.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are like Svetlana, aren't you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Vasili!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. How could I be like her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ivan, I don't mean it in a bad way, but look at her. That same watchfulness, eyes that see more than others, and a coiled spring stillness, as if waiting for something unexpected. Svetlana was a dancer Natasha knew when she was young. They were, better than friends. It did not bother us, her family, but many others were scandalized. Svetlana was involved in something dangerous and she dragged Natasha into it. In the end, the danger got her killed. It was a tragedy and it broke something in our Natasha. She has been alone since."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was considering leaving when Ivan slid a plate in front of me. A golden chicken breast sat nestled in fluffy white rice. Steamed asparagus, green beans, and carrots completed the dish. It smelled wonderful and tasted even better. I settled back, with a sigh of satisfaction and ate slowly, savoring the simple flavors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well?" Ivan asked a few minutes later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Amazing! Thank you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"See Vasili, not exactly like Svetlana. Food was always an after thought for her. We mean no disrespect to you, Shan. It is just so rare for Natasha to bring anyone here, much less let them stay while she is away. It is good, but we want to understand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know either. She is rather frightening at the school. Most of us think she considers us a waste of her time. Today, I think she hides behind it so she doesn't have to face what happened to her friend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You knew?" Vasili asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She told me about Svetlana last night. I might be like her, but I won't be dragging Ms.Korikova into anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe it would be best if you did. It might shake her loose, remind her to live her life instead of hiding from it," Vasili said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Or get her killed," Ivan said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She would be alive again. Is it better to live long, but dead life, or live short and good one?" Vasili countered. It felt like an old argument, worn and comfortable like a favorite night gown.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Help her for us, please. Help her find something to let her live again," Ivan added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will do all I can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, good! Now finish your food. It is best when warm." Once I was finished, Vasili set a second plate in front of me. Two thin pancakes were rolled up with a filling of some kind and a small dish of honey was set next to them. "Crepes, with poppy seed and apple, a house speciality. Please try."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"These are wonderful. My mom tried to make crepes once, but they didn't work out. How do you get them so perfect?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let me show you," Ivan said. He motioned me close and demonstrated how to quickly pour and swirl the batter to get it thin enough, without gaps. "The trick is the batter must be thin enough. Too many try to make it too thick and it won't flow easily enough. Here, you try." I tried to mimic his motions, but didn't come close. I started to step away, but he motioned me back. "Keep trying. It is simple, once you get it." It took a dozen tries, but he was right, once I had done it once, it became simpler. "I will let you have my recipe, if you come and tell me how your family liked them." I nodded and he handed me a stained card from a paper strewn counter. "I can recite from memory."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ivan, we should be setting up for the dinner rush," Vasili interrupted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should be going," I added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You will come see us again?" Ivan asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, of course!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Take this, it is Natasha's favorite. Try and get her to eat all of it," Vasili said as he handed me a plate piled high with cabbage rolls.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll see what I can do. Thank you for your hospitality."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A friend of Natasha's is family. You are always welcome here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slipped out to the street and up to the apartment. I had just settled back on the couch when Ms. Korikova came in. "Cabbage rolls? How did you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Vasili insisted. I like your family."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did they tell you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just that they worry about you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing more?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What else would they tell me, Ms. Korikova?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Natasha, please call me Natasha. As a Strange, you are no longer my student."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then what are we?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would wish you to be a friend. Did they talk of Lana?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would like that. No, they really didn't say anything about Lana. Although, I guess you were more than friends. It does not matter to me. I am the same way and have a woman lover of my own. Is there anything else I should know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"About my family, no. About being a Strange, probably, but I already gave you all of my advice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"About that, I have given it serious thought. Not sure of all my conclusions yet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is expected. It is a lot to handle. I have been thinking of what I said about magic. You might try your centering ritual for dance when using it. You will need to find something faster than the five slow breaths, but it might be a place to start."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I worked my ass off to get into Davisson and I don't want to leave. This thing feels like it won't give me a choice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's always choice, but I watched Lana try and stay at school. It didn't end well. As the head of the ballet section, I don't want you to leave either. You inspire the others and you don't have dancer, mega-bitch ego. As someone who lost a lover to this, I want you to find a path that lets you live."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Talia called while I was on my way home. I had completely forgotten about the All Hallows Eve party at the Midnight Gardens we had planned on going to. I still hadn't come up with a good costume idea. I had thought of a Conflict for Mars costume, but hadn't gotten the elaborate fabrics it would require. In desperation, I called Talia back, asking for ideas. We settled on something based on The Forever City starting characters. Typical costumes were a mix of sexy wear and military wear. My mom had fatigues from her time in the army and I had worn out dance wear that could be cut down. By the end of the evening I had something that would work.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Midnight Garden was filled with wild and varied costumes. Heavy, pounding beats drifted up from the basement bar and people would slip downstairs, dance for a while, then take a break in the gardens themselves. Night blooming plants and strange sculptures formed the large garden area in the greenhouse roofed back area. A walkway, large enough for a single set of tables, ringed the garden, with subdued light to reduce disruption of the plants. It was our favorite place to come, dark, quiet, and alternative. It was made better by our new status. Many friends smiled and nodded when they would see us holding hands or kissing in the shadows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were sipping drinks, while taking a break from dancing, when my phone rang with Detective Bishop's ring tone. "Shit," Talia muttered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mason, we have wild dogs running loose in the park. They aren't normal ones. We need everyone to help contain this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, but I'll need someone to get me. I'm at the Midnight Garden in the Village."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sending a car. Be outside in ten minutes. We're in the north end of the park. I'll send someone that knows where we are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm coming with you, no argument," Talia said, almost at the same time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure? There's a good chance they will find out who and what you are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok. Helping is more important than hiding."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They probably won't let you in the cruiser," I started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They will, just get the back door open somehow," Talia said through a strange smile. She fingered a ring on her finger and faded from sight. I could still see a faint outline of her, if the light was just right.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A cruiser pulled up just as Talia faded out. "Mason."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Polina? They called you out for this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I can hold my own, if needed. Get in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you open the back? I'd like to drop my spare costume bits in the back." She flipped a switch and I opened the back door. Talia slid in after I had tossed my fake weapon and cloak in. We accelerated away at a fast pace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something dark crawled up my nerves, nagging at me, as we roared toward the park. Every time I tried to get a handle on it, it would skitter away, just out of reach.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mason, follow me. We're headed toward the Leskar and the Mere. So far we have seen at least six very large canines." She handed me a headset comm and headed into the trees. She didn't see me open the door for Talia. Once she was out, we jogged after Polina.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Chatter came through the comm as soon as I had it in place. The canine were herding people around the trees and dodging us. It was soon apparent they were playing with us, darting into view just enough to keep us chasing them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two hours after the arrival of the Ghost Precinct, the canines disappeared. Half an hour later we called off the search, having uncovered no trace of where they came from or went. We were getting ready to head back to headquarters when a call came in to Bishop. She muttered quietly into her comm for a few minutes, then waved me over. "Mason, do you or your mom know anyone at the Met? There's been theft and I'd like to get background on what was taken."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't, but I can give mom a call and see if she does. Do we know what types of art were taken?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Items from a Nasazi collection."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stepped a bit away and made the call. "My mom has some familiarity with the Nasazi. She has consulted for the special collections group about the Nasazi," Talia whispered from a shadow near me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ms. Marissa Arakov has some familiarity with Nasazi items."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is her expertise?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alternative possibilities, similar to our team," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Call her. Have her meet us at the Met," Bishop requested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ms. Arakov arrived at the Met shortly after we did. "Shan, what's going on? Why are the police here? You were very cryptic on the phone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Some Nasazi items were stolen this evening. I was hoping you might know if they have any alternative properties, or if they might be dangerous in awakened hands. This is the Ghost Precinct. We deal with Veil situations." I introduced the members of the team, then introduced Talia as she appeared from the shadows near Ms. Arakov's cab. "I see you brought Talia. Good thinking." Her quickly damped surprise almost gave things away, but the rest of the team was distracted with the theft.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talia has helped me occasionally. She should see this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We followed Bishop into the building and down into the lower storage areas. The curator started listing off the missing items. Most were pot sherds and knife points. Ms. Arakov was only half listening until he mentioned a ceramic fragment that had a very rare Nasazi pattern on it. "That's the important one," Ms. Arakov said. "There is a Nasazi legend about the Place of Restless Spirits, a place where the gods and man could easily meet. Some of us thought that fragment might provide clues about it. Unfortunately, Nasazi histories were all oral. So to fully understand the item, we would need a Nasazi with enough ancient lore to recognize it. None of our inquiries found anyone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What we do know is there was a major event concerning the Place of Restless Spirits around 1150. After this, the Nasazi began to shift their worship and ceremonies away from the gods they had worshipped to that point. They also began to migrate away from many of their settlements. Some of it was because the areas were drying out, but some of us think there were other factors as well," Ms. Arakov continued.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you have any pictures of the item?" Talia asked. The curator silently handed pictures to Talia. She thumber through them and stopped abruptly, "This looks like something I've seen." She pulled her laptop out of her bag and started flipping through bookmarks. "Here," she turned the laptop so we could see, "it's a memory enhancer. It isn't of much use unless you have someone with memories of the events the enhancer targets." The image on the screen was a mandala-like pattern, engraved into a copper disk. Parts of the pattern on the ceramic fragment looked similar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Honey, that's a gaming site."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Doesn't matter, mom. The idea is sound and it would explain how the Nasazi might have hidden the location. It sounds like what happened was very bad."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But it wouldn't be of use unless the thief had a Nasazi in their pocket, one with enough knowledge of the old ways for the enhancer to work. Would there be any Nasazi that remember enough for the enhancer to have a chance?" I added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There were a couple of really old men, in a village in northern Yew Nexica that know some of the old stories. The lead on the Nasazi collections met with them a few times when crating the items for the collection. Ms. Elisha Bradley, the lead, would have contact data. I can call her," Ms.Arakov said. At Bishop's nod, she pulled her cell phone. "Elisha will be here soon."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I reached out while we were waiting, trying to determine if this was more than just a theft. Veil energy was concentrated at the back of the vault and near the shelf where the enhancer had rested. It was only bad luck that the thief had crossed a detector and triggered the alarms. Otherwise the theft might have remained undetected until the next time the collection was inventoried. None of the images I picked up revealed the identity or appearance of the thief.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sorry it took so long," an older woman said as she hurried up. "Marissa, what are you doing here? They told me some of the Nasazi artifacts were stolen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They were. They called me because Shan knew I had worked on the project. The curator has the list of missing items. One of them was the strange pottery fragment with the unidentifiable pattern on it. The one you said your Nasazi contacts made a big deal of."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Elisha turned pale at that. "Do you have any cop ways of contacting other police? Some way to check on those two old guys? They live outside of Cathedral Rock, Yew Nexica and have no phone service."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why would they be in danger?" Bishop asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They were worried when I was talking to them. They seemed to think there were secrets that people would kill for related to the Nasazi past. I was asked to keep certain information about the strange pattern to myself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Such as the memory enhancer aspect of it?" asked Talia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How could you kow that? I never told Marissa about that." Elisha replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It just seemed likely when I looked at the pattern. There are other memory patterns around the world to give clues," Talia replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please, get word down there. The local sherrif was Albert Mattsen. He knows my contacts personally."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Polina, get on the radio to the precinct and see if you can get a message through. Is there anything else you can tell us? Were there suspicious people or events recently regarding these artifacts? Anything strange at all could be a clue," Bishop asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ms. Bradley, how much do you know about these artifacts?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why? You don't think...?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They were targetted specifically. Maybe you should tell us everything you know about them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know that much. Most of them weren't unique enough to be worried about. The pattern piece was presented to me by the two old men. They wanted me to hide it away, somewhere no one would think to look. It wasn't intended for display. I complied with that, although it got into the online catalog system when it was inventoried. I didn't notice right away, but I had it pulled as soon as I found out. They said it would help someone with 'the memories' find the Place of Restless Spirits, but they wouldn't give details on the place itself. All I know is what anthropologists have pieced together over the years. In the years building up to 1150 the rains were becoming less frequent and the water supplies were drying up. Nasazi were starving from lack of food. By 1150 things were desperate enough that the shamans decided to try a major ritual to return the rains. They left the villages and cities and gathered at what would be the Place of Restless Spirits. The process built for many days, ending in a massive final ceremony. One warrior staggered back to the nearest village and died. He would only say that a great unrest had been released and all the shamans had died."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was about to ask more when Bishop's radio squawked again. "Shit! There's been a break in at the 5th Ave. branch of the library, rare collections."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I turned white and tried not to stammer as I asked,"Are there any casualties?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, and it looks like they may not have succeeded. We need to get there and get a senior curator to meet us," Bishop answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My, my father is in charge of the collection," I was able to answer. "I will call him." It took three tries until his phone woke him. I ignored the irritation in his voice as I said, "Dad, this is Detective Mason, the police need you to come to the library. There was a break in at rare collections."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shan, why are you calling instead of an officer?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective, remember? I told you last weekend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll be there in fifteen. Get Fred Hayes out of bed too. He knows the occult documents better than I do." I passed the message on to Bishop and headed toward the car, motioning Talia and Ms. Arakov to follow. Polina raised an eyebrow when I motioned them into the squad, but didn't say anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once again we were waved through the police line and taken deep into the library building. Most of it was familiar from the times I had visited my dad at work. The rare collections were stored in an environmentally controlled vault in the deep basements of the building. The officer at the vault door had little to add from the initial report. The alarms had sounded, but when the guards arrived, no one was in sight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wandered the nearby areas, reaching out until I felt energies swirling in the room. The heaviest concentration was around the vault. Dark, coiled energy, waiting for something to trigger it. A fainter trace of something different took me down a hall to a section of rooms to the left of the vault. I tried the door, swung it open, and fumbled on the lights. I couldn't stop the startled gasp I made when I saw a body half out of the floor. It was human and wearing dark black clothes. It was slumped over, blood pooled under its mouth. The smell of burnt flesh permeated the room. "Bishop, call the coroner and meet me down the left side hallway. I have a body."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While we waited for the coroner, I carefully walked into the room, reaching out until I could see what happened. I didn't get much. The corpse materialized in the floor, screamed in shock and pain, before dying almost immediately. I did see a talisman roll away from his left hand and lodge under a table. I had Polina process it before taking it in a gloved hand and examining it. I heard a bit off hiss from the door and saw Talia had poked her head into the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hurried over to her and pulled her back from the scene. "No need for this to be lodged in your head."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Too late, lover. Did you find a twelve sided gem, probably an emerald? This is a Gate Jump gone bad," She said, pushing past me, into the room. She walked around the corpse, staring at it from several angles. "Definitely matches the description of a blocked jump. Most spells and items try to protect the jumper from this kind of thing. Only severe interference will result in a mis-jump this bad." I held up the evidence bag and showed her the stone. "That's a gate director. You know Gates will allow travel from this realm to others. They have another effect as well. Since they bleed energy into the realm where they are, that energy can be used to 'jump' from place to place in the realm. It take a locator gem, like the one you found, or powerful spells."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where's Detective Mason? What's going on?" I heard my father ask as Bishop started to talk to him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Arthur, what's this about?" Fred was asking as I walked back to the vault.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There was an attempted break in," Bishop explained. "You are here to determine if anything is missing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My dad and Fred keyed open the vault, the Bishop and our team went in first, clearing the area. When the radio crackledwith the all clear,  I led Fred and my dad back to where the team was. Nothing looked disturbed as we made our way to the back of the vault. A heavy glass case, directly in front of where the rest of the team was, radiated thick, hot waves of menace, driving me back a step when I approached too closely. "What's in this case?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really old and very rare books of magic, spells, and theory. We have one of the seven copies of 'Gates of the Web Queen', written by Giovanni Astalli. It is supposed to describe a way to walk the Webs to the queen and provide supplications to prevent her killing the supplicant. There is another, 'Dimensions of the Evil One', written by Enrico Borbone, that is supposed to detail a mystic realm between this world and Hell. Others describe early Cothloc rituals, laws, and leaders. We have a diary that belonged to Ian Fredricks who supposedly knew of and watched gates between worlds. The diary is incomplete and no one has found any of the gates he was supposed to watch. Finally, there are alchemic and magic treatises on spells and potions. It is one of the most complete collections outside the Cothloc City of Light, the holy city of the hierophancy," Fred replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything appear to be missing?" Bishop asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. It looks like the case was never breached," Fred answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you have a copy of Nasazi Mysticism and Demonic Influence by Ferdinand Escobar?" Ms. Arakov asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, we do. Why?" Fred replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What types of security do you have on this vault?" Bishop asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My dad answered with a list of standard security items, motion detectors, fire and smoke systems, preimeter alarms, and the like when Bishop asked him about security. Fred looked away with a look of relief that I just caught. I moved closer to Hayes and said quietly, "Mr. Hayes, could I talk to you alone for a moment?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He looked a bit nervous, but nodded slowly. We walked down an aisle of the vault,until we were out of ear-shot, and I asked, "We need to know what additional security is on the vault. Things like the jump blocking magic on the perimeter."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um, I don't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mr. Hayes, we have a body in a side room and there is something on that case we are close to. We need to know to keep my team out of danger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, but not a word of this to your father. He signed off on the cost, but he doesn't want to know about the other world around us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok. I know he doesn't." Hayes detailed several high powered magic systems and spells placed as protection. He finished by giving Olivia Bishop as the primary contact for the magic defenses. We walked back to the group once he was finished.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shan?" Talia slipped up close to me and whispered. "What if dead guy wasn't the only one?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stopped dead for a second, then whispered, "Ask pPolina or Bishop for a spare comm." I turned to the police team. "Casey, Aragon, go cover the vault entrance. Bishop, call your sister Olivia and see if the jump blocking spell can report how many jumps it blocked. Fisher, Vijahz, with me, weapons hot," I barked, just like I would in Conflict for Mars. My dad just stared at me while the others jumped into motion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We slipped back to the vault door, close behind Casey and Aragon. I picked up the trail immediately, motioning for Vijahz and Fisher to follow close, yet keeping a clear field of fire. It took them a moment and a hurried explanation to get them where I wanted them. The trail led to the section of the vault farthest from the case and our group.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A large distortion of energy hunched close to one of the shelves. I stopped and looked around, as if I couldn't see anything, then moved past the area. I motioned to Fisher and Vijahz that I planned to sneak up on the target. They stared out me without understanding until I dragged them farther away and explained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We moved back toward the target, again, moving like we were searching for something. At the very last minute I turned to the point on the floor and said, "I can see you. Stand and identify yourself." The distortion didn't move. "Vijahz, toss me your baton and cover me," I added, snagging the baton out of the air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The shimmer flickered and resolved into a man, rising, hands glowing with energy. He made motions as if he were going to throw something. I heard two shots, followed by pings as they bounced off the glass doors protecting racks of books. My hand shot out, just as he moved to complete his throw. A blazing purple bolt burned through his mouth and out the back of his head. He dropped like a stone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nausea rose in waves, sorrow, fear, and shock fought for dominance as my vision started to collapse in on itself. I could feel my body start to shake. I grabbed my roiling emotions and reactions, threw them in a mental box, slammed the lid, and snapped locks closed on it, as I drew three deep, shuddering breaths. Utter calm settled over me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"One hostile neutralized. Arakov, Casey, any contacts?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Negative, commander," Talia answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, no, I don't think so," Casey answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"XO, check with Mr. Hayes and see what it will take to lock down the vaults and let Casey know. Fisher, Vijahz, one more sweep once the vault is locked down."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Affirm, commander." A couple moments later she said, "Casey, close the vault doors. That should engage locking and security."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Locked down," Casey replied, seconds later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Our second sweep came up clean. We returned to find Talia in a loose fighting crouch, her knives out and ready. The left one folded back along her left arm to block and slash, the right one held low and forward for attacking. She rose when she saw us and dropped them into their sheaths in her boots. I first saw Talia with her knives when we were sixteen. I had thought they were just for show until I learned she was training three days a week with Martin Esterhaaz. Then she invited me to watch some of her bouts and I learned she was very good with them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's next, boss?" Talia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We need a sweep and clean of the outside corridors so we can get the civilians clear. Don't want any more hostiles slipping in as we leave. You, Aragon, and Casey will be Sweep 1. Fisher, Vijahz, and I will be Sweep 2. If you find hostiles, neutralize in any way necessary. Peri, Polina, a dead hostile is back the way we came. Examine it for any information it might give. Bishop, you and the rest of the team keep the civilians safe." I noticed my dad and Fred Hayes watching me with fear in their eyes. Ms. Arakov was fighting back a smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What type of hostile?" Peri asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Human, male. I killed it with an energy blast," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We swept the corridors, but all we found was a faint gate signature down the side away from the corpse in the floor. Polina and Peri found nothing on the downed hostile. Peri said we would have to wait for DNA for ID. My blast through the face had destroyed any chance of dental records and the missfiring of its spells had burned its hands away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Bishop, will we need to wait for Internal Affairs to clear this incident, or can we get the civilians out?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"IA doesn't know what to do with us. We can bag and tag the bodies once Polina and Peri finish with them. They can wait for the meat wagon. Mr. Hayes can secure the vault as soon as we get the hostile out of it. How did you know there would be another?" Bishop asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is the best way to get into a locked area?" Talia asked, before I could respond.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Get someone with a key to open it," Bishop responded slowly. Talia smiled at her. "What was that stunt you pulled, Mason?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Small unit tactics, Conflict for Mars style. Does the academy have a tactics course? Might be good if we could go through it," I answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I sent my dad home, promising to see him the next evening. Ms. Arakov and Talia left while the team made its way back to the station. After filling out our reports, we broke for sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was just leaving the building when Ash Aragon called to me. "Detective Mason, want to grab a quick drink?" I stopped, more from surprise than from desire. Aragon had always been one of the most distant of the group. Her normally cold eyes held something else as she quickly caught up to me. She was impressive, tall, muscled, with a fighter's movements. Her face was strong jawed, maybe pretty if she would smile, but her normal look was cold and calculating.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now? I'm dead tired," I answered, still trying to read what was in her eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please," she said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, sure, you know of somewhere?" The 'please' startled me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's a place near here, caters to cops and stays open as late as possible. It's a short walk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I motioned for her to lead the way. She dropped back to walk beside me and said, "I know I'm cold. It's just me. I, well, let me get a drink first. I'm no good at talking." She abruptly stopped talking and sped up her pace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Maybe eight minutes later we rounded the corner on Water St. She led the way to a place called Storm Haven. Inside was a dark bar, dressed in a Jamacain motif. A tall, drealocked Jamacain man rose from a stool behind the bar when we walked in. There were a few other cops in the place, seated at the booths along the walls, talking quietly. The tables in the center were empty, their candles exstinguished. "Aragon," he waved from the bar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Derrick, this is Detective Mason, from the squad. Mason, this is Derrick Castle. He owns and runs this haven from the world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Charmed," he said, giving a bow. "What you having?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The usual," Aragon said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took me a while to think of something, since I usually didn't dink much. "Do you have Hensey cognac, otherwise, a gin and tonic."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Derrick returned with the drinks. I reached for cash but Aragon said, "Got this." Drink in hand, she led the way to a table near the back. "I'd sit at the bar, but I don't want to be overheard."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I finally identified the look in her eyes as nervousness as we sat. "Where did you learn what you did tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Which thing that I did?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The tactics stuff. You and the Arakov woman were tight, like you had training. You were SWAT level, maybe military level, but you don't seem military."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I just looked at her, trying not to laugh, it was so crazy. "From video games. We learned it from first person shooters and massively multiplayer combat games. I'm surprised it translated to reality."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to learn. Can you teach me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could try, but wouldn't it be easier to get it through the police academy?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Won't happen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But Detective Bishop..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It won't happen. We're a joke to the department. A place they send the screw-ups and misfits. They don't care what happens with us. If we stop something, great, but we aren't worth their time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How are we being paid?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As a joke. It keeps us on the roles and out of their way. Bishop probably thought she could get you basic police training, but I guarantee, she won't be able to do anything for us as a group." She looked down at her drink, slammed it back, and stalked to the bar to get another one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I sipped the Hensey while I waited. It was better than I remembered, or maybe it was because of the day I had been through. I was half way through it when she stalked back and sat down again. She gave a twisted little smile, "Sorry to be negative, but truth is, we are in place to watch you. The brass want to be sure the Strange is contained, beholden to the police, and under control. Our little group is how they pull it off. Thing is, you're good. Our last Strange fit in perfectly. He could detect big, obvious stuff, but you, you and the Arakov woman are the real thing. With you, we could make an actual difference."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We sat in slience for a while, each lost in thoughts of our own. At last she kind of shook her head and said, "Guess we should get some sleep. Think about what I asked, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I nodded slowly, "I will."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You need a ride anywhere? It's kind of late for the subway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure. Could you drop me in The Village, near the Arakov Market?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a second her face twitched into an almost smile, "You and the Arakov woman, I thought so. It's cool." My face was flaming as I followed her to the door, making me glad the place was so dark.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Talia was still awake when I arrived at her place, even though it was five in the morning. She was sitting with her mom in the kitchen of the common area sipping tea. "You're the new Strange," Ms. Arakov said it as a statement. I nodded. "Talia says you can see through her shell image. Is that true?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hesitated, looking between the two of them, before asking, "What do you mean by 'shell image'?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A shell image is a camoflage spell that lets us look like everyone else in this realm, so we don't stand out as other. Talia says you can see through hers. Can you see through mine as well?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," I replied slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The change came when you were sick." Again, it was a statement rather than a question. "I don't know why it never occurred to me. The Queen of the Web has given you a great honor." I just stared at her, uncertain how to react. "What you and Talia did at the museum was amazing. I am so proud of you both."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia opened her mouth at the same time I did, but her mom spoke before we could, "I was wrong about all that time you two spent playing those games. Before I came here, I lived in Sphere and trained with the Asylum guards. Your reactions were worhty of them. Be proud of what you are." Her eyes turned bright, "Just be careful. I don't want to lose either of you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I sat for a moment, staring into my cup, then said, "I need some help. I used a dangerous mind trick tonight to get through the emergency. Before the night is out, I need to defuse it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you need?" they asked, almost at the same time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I stuffed all my reactions of dealing with the hostile into a mental box and sealed it tight. I dare not leave it sealed too long, or I might start to fear it so much that I will never open it. Everything I've read says that way is madness. I want the two of you to help me through my reactions when I open the box. I expect I will throw up, get the shakes, and go through an emotional maelstrom from my first kill," my voice was completely calm, since everything was still locked away. "Could we start in Talia's bathroom, then move to her room once the pukes are over?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course!" MS. Arakov said. Talia didn't say anything, just came over and wrapped her arms around me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next few hours were awful. Once I opened the locks, it all boiled out, the fear, the sorrow, the shocked look on the man's face as my energy blast burned through his face. The smell of scortched flesh and the sound of the body hitting the floor. I threw up everything I could and kept dry heaving for several spasms longer. Talia held me and her mom wiped away the bits clinging to my face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We retreated to Talia's room and they held me while I shook and cried like I never had before. Every time I closed my eyes, the scene replayed, over and over again. I knew the horror would fade with time, but it didn't help for those hours.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can you talk about it?" her mom asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was so horrible. One moment we were looking at a shimmer on the floor, the next, he was rising up, threatening my team. I didn't even think about what I was doing. I just blasted him down. I didn't try to stop him, or talk to him, just killed him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia'smom took my face between her hands, turned me to look directly at her, and said, "I am not trying to reduce the impact, or say you shouldn't feel bad for the death of the man at the library. Just consider this, humans can be monsters too. Keep that in mind before you judge yourself harshly. He would have killed you, or one of your team. It doesn't make it easier, but it does make it reasonable."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My mom and Mr. Hayes were discussing the books in the case. A lot of unpleasantness could be caused by just any one book from that collection. Imagine what they could do with the set," Talia added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know some of that. Shit, in Conflict for Mars I wouldn't hesitate, but this was a real person. This wasn't an avatar that would respawn the next time we fought that team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At least we know you aren't a psychopath," her mom said with a smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We sat in silence for a while, each of us staring into the distance. At last I asked, "Can you tell me anything about Stranges?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A little. There are Stranges and then there are Stranges. Many are just adequate. They have the ability to detect threats and some skill in dealing with them. The better ones have magic of their own and are adept at coping with anything the Veil throws at them. The truly powerful are chosen by the Queen of the Web and have the ability to see things that have ben touched by magic, and the events that occurred. They have powerful magic of their own and the ability to fight with great skill and tenacity. As you come into your own, I expect you will be one of the truly powerful ones."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The previous Strange was one of the weaker ones, right?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. That's why he didn't last very long. There is something I would recommend, since you are chosen of the Queen. Myth says Stranges can become more powerful and centered by going through a Gate at least once in their career. You should let Talia or I take you to Sphere. That way you can see some of the wonders behind the Veil. It will help offset the ugliness you will see as a Strange."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would like that, but only after I've slept."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could skip school and sleep here," Talia said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd love to, but, ah fuck it, great idea. Let me call Natasha, uh Ms.Korikova, and have her mark me out for the day."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"First name basis with the ogre of Juliard? Should I be worried?" Talia asked, mostly teasing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I kissed her passionately, forgetting for a moment her mom was there. "You should not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her mom was smiling when we broke apart. "Get a room, you two!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're in it," Talia answered back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I left a message on Natasha's phone when she didn't pick up. I hoped the phone hadn't woken her. As soon as her mom left, we stripped, falling into bed as soon as our clothes were off. Her beauty tempted me, but I slipped into sleep before I could do anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">We woke in mid afternoon, had a lazy meal, then Talia headed off to work while I headed to Leia's laundromat. I didn't say a word to her, just passed her a note saying, "Scan me carefully for bugs. I think the ghost precint team is wired. I'll explain when I know I'm clean."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She went into her room and came out with a small black box with a headphone attached. She ran it over me several times, very slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She pointed at my backpack and shook her head, scrawling a quick return note, "Leave that in my tiny room."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I dropped the pack and followed her through the passages. She spoke once we were in her inner sanctum, "You are clean but there's something in your pack. Now, what happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I detailed the previous night. "Your instincts are good. How did you come by them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I played Shadow Journey series over and over again as an Infiltrator and played a lot of Conflict for Mars," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I liked the Infiltrator class as well. Who are you in Conflict for Mars? I'm Ayasha Zeriss of Bronson's Raiders, but our schedules don't let us play much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nazrah Kaadesh..." I started to reply.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Nazrah Kaadesh? Supreme Commander of Plaizaar Regiment and Queen of Tournaments? You and Aeryn Solaris wrote the book on tactics. No wonder you knew what to do. But, you didn't come here just to explain what happened, did you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, that Nazrah, and no, I had a few questions, too. Is there some way we can get secure communications gear? Would you have a place where we could set up a secure facility, something we coud sweep and keep clean for discussing things we don't want overheard? Do you have recommendations on detection gear for finding bugs and trackers? How would we set up a secure network location?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't want much, do you?" Leia said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just to survive," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, you don't think I'm as crazy as Nikki claims?" Leia asked</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not unless I am too," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is more noise around the local Gladius groups. I'll see what I can do. For now, I can let you have the upper floor, next to this. There's a single door entry part way down the block to the left of the laundromat, labelled 1E, that gives direct access." She tossed me a dual striped key card and an old fashioned looking brass key. Examining it closely showed it had many small notches to go with the apparent antiqueness. "Yeah, we paranoids have to stay together. The key will open the outer door. Inside, you need the key card. If you want, I can add either a voice recognizer or a number pad to the door. After that, it's a straight shot to the level with your large room. Give me a couple of days to set up all the screening before you use it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The clean network will be as clean as I can make it, just know that any time you conenct into the main web, you aren't completely secure. I will set it up so it is easy to do a hard disconnect when you want to be sure of security. The com gear will take a little while and cost a fair amount bcause it will need to be custom made and tested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pick the safer of the voice recognizer or the numeric keypad. How much money are we talking about? I have access to some and a police salary besides," I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll have to do a bit of research on the gear. The building I'm not too worried about, since I hold title to it. I should have a spare sweeper I can let you have," she said as she hunted through drawers and piles of gear. "Ah, here it is. It isn't the fastest one, but it is the most thorough. Do three or more passes over the test area to be certain you found everything. Sweep everything. Bugs can be very small these days and hidden in just about anything. Just remember, there are sophisticated items that are only active when they are sending. I can rig a cage around the space so things can't transmit out, but if you don't find them, a good team can spot locations by the absence of signal as well as the signal itself. This detector attempts to activate sleeping devices, but it's a moving target, so some will always slip through. I'll see if I can extend the active detectors around your space. That way when something powers up, you will be notified. The safest course is to sweep everything, then visually inspect, and only bring items you have carefully checked into your secure space."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We sat in silence a few minutes, then Leia spoke again, "Is it possible you have a mole in your team? That is a common Gladius tactic."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wish I could say no, but I think there is." I told her about our arriving too late at each demon sighting. "You've known Nikki a while longer than I have. She's clean, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I think I'd know if she weren't. She might have thoughts on the others. You could see how long each has been in ghost precinct, but that's not always a good indicator."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would any of this show up on a deep check into their backgrounds?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe. I could take a look if I had a list of precinct members. Can you get that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pretty easily. We will need a secure way to communicate. Is there any way to get clean phones with the location tracking disabled?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, for a bit of cash, I can get those. For a bit more money, I can get ones that have secure, encrypted voice, data, and location. They only show up when they are active and their signal is spread across towers in a format to make tracing extremely hard. They can be shut completely down, with no remote wake-up or ping capability. Would those be better?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Those would be perfect. Any chance you could get," I counted silently, myself, Leia, Nikki, Talia, my mom, Talia's mom, Natasha Korikova, "seven to start, with maybe one to four more later?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It'll take a few days, but yeah, I should be able to. Until then, we can use the old drop box method. You place a packet under the second bench after the first intersection in the under bridge park, entering from the water end nearest us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let me know what you need for money and I will slowly slip cash to you. Unfortunately, most of my resources are in trackable places."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You might consider sliding some of it into less trackable locations."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I might be interested, if you have any good recommendations. But I must head out for now. Other things I need to do tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">I arrived at Natasha's just after she did. She was just settling down after arriving when I knocked on her door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you get enough sleep?" Natasha asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, uh, sorry about class..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Were you at the library break-in? It's been all over the news and I recognized shots of some of your team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The news says there were deaths."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There were, but I can't talk about it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. I shouldn't have asked. I wanted to share some things I found from my time with Lana. Like you, there was no training. She just got dumped into it. After she died, I started asking questions and digging in old books. There was nothing to find in Moskava. When I came here, I started digging in rare book collections, where ever I could find them, and found a little bit. I spent most of today digging through old boxes until I found the notes I had made. There were references in the oldest books about people called the Monitors. Discussion of the Monitors appeared frequently in the really old documents, but became more scarce as the seventeen hundreds drew to a close. By the end of the eighteen hundreds, all mention of them is gone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, were they killed off, or did something else happen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing was very clear. I think some of them were hunted and others died without being able to recruit replacements. The last mention of them implied there was some type of headquarters in London, at least as late as the early 1800s."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did they do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think they helped the Stranges of their time. They collected information and covered up any spill-over into the world, kind of like the Ghost Precinct tries to do now. It's weird, though. You'd think something would have leaked out, some papers or something would land where it could be found. Even in the Ruskala Collective conspiracies always came to light eventually." We sat quietly for a while. I found myself drifting off when she said, "Should we go get some food?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd love to, but I promised my dad I would be home for dinner. He needs to talk about the library events, too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We could do it when you have more time. My family likes guests."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I smiled and added, "I found that out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could I ask you something?" I nodded. "I'd like to be involved again. I, well, I haven't felt as alive as I did this last Monday."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would like having your knowledge available. Something should be possible."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Dinner was a quiet affair. I could tell my dad wanted to start asking questions, but was being polite. As soon as we were finished he started with, "Something has changed you. First you sign on with the cops, a group little better than jack-booted thugs, then you say you killed a man. Did't we teach you anything? What happened to violence never solves anything?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I never understood that. Maybe in the context of world events, but what if I'm in danger of rape, or a friend is in danger of death? Shouldn't I fight back then? Should I just roll over and let the nastiness occur?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, uh, I, no, of course you should defend yourself," dad stammered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's what I was doing, defending you and the others."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did you mean when you said you killed that man with an energy blast? I remember how weird that sounded."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dad, Fred told me you never wanted to know about the other side of the world. If I answer your questions, it will pull you into that world. Do you really want that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To his credit he sat and really thought about it before asking, "Does your mother know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, but she already had suspicions about the other side from the museum murders."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to know what is going on with my daughter. I want to know why Talia was calling you commander and how you could kill a man and have no reaction." I took a deep breath, motioned for mom to sit beside him, and told him the story, down-playing the injuries I had sustained. At the end of my tale, he rose, poured cognac for each of us, and returned to the couch. After an almost steady sip he said, "And the killing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The, man, was going to kill members of my team or kill me. I refused to let, him, have that chance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How could it not effect you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It did effect me. I used a dangerous trick to not deal with it then. Now I see him die every time I close my eyes. Every sound, every motion, every expression of that moment is etched into my memory. And what I fear even more than that memory is the thought I might end up having to do it again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And the commander thing? What was that all about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I couldn't help myself, I started laughing, almost hysterically. It took me several long minutes to stop, all the while he was watching me, getting more frustrated. "I'll tell you what I told another officer. Talia and I leared it from Conflict for Mars, a video game."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A video game? That doesn't explain why they followed you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it doesn't. I have no answer, except they thought we knew what we were doing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know what to make of this yet, but thank you. There's no way you can step away from this, is there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I wish there was, but there is not." He just nodded and I saw a sadness in his eyes I had never seen before.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Silence stretched on for a long and uncomfortable time before dad said, "Anu, the men that were harrassing you at the museum, what did they look like?" dad asked. Mom described the ones she had seen, mentioning how they were conservatively dressed and immaculately groomed. "I think I've seen men like that hanging around the library. They were very interested in the religious history section. One of them would try to slip into the occult archives when he thought no one was looking. They never requested anything from the section, so they stood out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd say they were just pests, but they are too consistent. They have to be looking for something specific," mom added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll see what they have requested from the archives and special collections," dad said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There were more questions and discussion, but few answers. It was starting to get late when we broke for bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sleep came quickly, but it was very restless. Nightmares about killing plagued me. I'd wake up every time I rolled over and didn't find a warm body next to me. I missed Talia's scent on the sheets, which made getting back to sleep even more difficult. I must have slept, but it was restless and not very satisfying.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I made it to class and through the entire day without being called for strange duties. The calm should have been comforting or relaxing, but it was neither. I missed the excitement, the chaos, and the uncertainty. The term adrenaline junky had never made sense to me before, but it did now.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Friday night and Saturday were harder. Dad wanted some family time, since we hadn't gotten much of late. It usually meant either a friendly game of some type or movies we had been wanting to see. We tried the game first, but it became clear that none of us were focusing on it. After that we switched to a movie. It was simpler, but I think we wouldn't remember what happened once it finished.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Saturday passed very slowly, after another restless night. Even the family favorite mini-golf at Pier 25 seemed awkward. As we finished the first time round the course, my father said, "Is it just me or does everything seems a bit drab after the excitement last week?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," my mom and I answered at the same time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What can we do about that?" dad asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure we want to do anything about it. What if we get too much excitement?" mom asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The second time through the course was better with each of us trying to focus on the now. By the end of the day it had returned to an almost normal outing. As we were leaving, my dad said, "You could have Talia meet us at the Shake Shack." I hugged him then called her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia walked in five minutes after we had walked down to Battery Park City from Pier 25. I grabbed her in a big hug before thinking about it. Some of the patrons gave us dirty looks, but most just smiled indulgently. We broke apart, embarassed, and sat down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Conversation stayed generic until we returned to my place. Then my father asked Talia, "Why did you refer to Shan as Commander last night?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did Shan tell you about video games? We have played one, the Mars game, since it was in beta. It is all about unit tactics and combat. Our team, the Plaizaar Regiment, wrote the book on in-game tactics. Shan is the commander of the group and I am her second in command. The tactics translated well to events at the library, wouldn't you say?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now what happens?" he asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We continue living our lives," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They know?" Talia asked me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, they do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is a lot to tell about the world beyond the veil. For starters, there are gates into many different worlds, including this one. I was going to ask Shan to come through the nearest one with me tomorrow. You are welcome to come, if you wish. I wanted to show her that there is beauty and wonder besides the terrors that she has seen," Talia added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is it safe?" my father asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As safe as anything in Yew Nork," Talia replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We'll think about it," mom replied. "Talia, you're welcome to stay the night. We usually finish the day with something we've wanted to watch, a movie or a show."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cool, I'd like to stay, thanks," Talia answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We picked a long movie we had been meaning to watch for several weeks. This time, everyone was more interested in it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everyone went to bed shortly after the movie ended. I couldn't keep my hands off Talia. "You keep that up and we'll have to fuck before we sleep," Talia said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would that be bad? I'd like my bed to smell like us, instead of me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about your parents?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't worry about them," I replied, nipping at the base of her horns. She rolled on top of me and started in. It was slow and languid, building to mind shattering orgasms for both of us. As my breathing returned to normal, I heard moans coming through the wall and smiled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tallia heard it too and turned to me, mortified. "I thought they couldn't hear."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I never said that, just to not worry. I've had many a night pleasuring myself to the sound of them going at it." Talia stared at me as her expression turned from embarassed, to amused, to turned on. My parents were not quiet in the throws of passion. I pulled her back down on me and slid my fingers around her clit and opening, teasing her slowly until she began to respond.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We drifted asleep while my parents were building to climax number two. Talia whispering a scandalized, "I didnt think it would be so exciting to overhear them," before she drifted off.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Consider - change so only Shan, Talia, and Talia'smom go through the gate this time */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Morning was a bit strained. Everyone blushed when mom asked, "Everyone sleep ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very well, thank you," Talia answered with a straight face. "How about you? We didn't keep you, up, did we?" She asked with a wicked grin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just enough," my dad answered. Mom turned bright red at that, but didn't say anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talia, when do your plans start for the day? I was thinking of Beljique waffles for breakfast," mom added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It could easily be a full day, since it would be good to have time to look around. Does that still work?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think we'll skip this time. I'm not quite ready to take that step," answered my dad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And I have an afternoon meeting that I'd have to be back for," mom added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Breakfast was delicious. My mom was an excellent cook and enjoyed it when she had the chance. Afterward, Talia and I took the subway to Talia's neighborhood. She led the way to a door I had only noticed after awakening, set in the back of the original Arakov Market.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The door opened onto a set of worn stone steps, descending to deep beneath the buildings above. They opened out into an enormous cavern, filled with jostling crowds, narrow stalls with twisting paths between them, and exotic and tantalizing aromas. "This is the local Mirror Souk, called so because it is a mirror of the imense Great Souk in Sphere." Talia led the way through one of the larger paths, past vendors of coffee, spices, strange fruits, and sizzling meats on sticks. She went slowly enough that I could almost take it all in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia walked up to a very old, dark skinned woman, sitting in a tiny stall, surrounded by baubles and trinkets. Few people stopped at her space, yet she was smiling as we walked up. She was dressed in worn, colorful skirts, layered, short to long, a frilly silk blouse of blazing scarlet, and an emerald green vest hanging open over the blouse. Her hair was bone white and tangled in tight curls. Her hands were long and bony, but still graceful in their movements.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia bowed to her and said, "Mama Ayeda, may we rent two tokens for Sphere?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You may rent one. The Strange gets her own. And may I saw, it's about damn time we had a Strange worthy of the title. You may think no one knows of you, young mistress, but many have heard of you since your first event," she replied, directly to me. She reached into a box and produced a large bronze medaliion, hanging from rainbow silk ribbons and handed it to Talia. "That will be two of this area's dollars. Please wait while I find the right item for our Strange." She rose slowly to her feet and shuffled into an area behind the curtains at the back of her shop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several minutes passed before she returned with a small black velvet sack in her hand. "This is yours. I dare not touch it as it atunes itself to the first person to come in contact with it. If you would hold out your hand?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Reluctantly I held my hand out to her. She untied the sack and dumped a silver ring into my hand. It was exquisitely worked, with a skull face detailed down to the tiniest striations in the bone. Set into the eye sockets were tiny clear stones with traceries of purple fog slowly drifting in them. When I slipped it on my right middle finger, the purple fog began to swirl in complex eddies and flows, speeding up or slowing down with my thoughts. "There you are my dear. Now you young people should be on your way and let me have some peace. Remember to return the token when you get back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* should Shan and Talia get matching items? could be hut companion rings - would this level of interference occur? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, mama, and good day to you," Talia replied, bowing once more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I made motions to bow as well, but Mama Ayeda waved me to a stop. "It is not seemly that the web blessed bow to a humble gate keeper."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, Mama Ayeda," I answered, face flaming.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia led us to the end of the path, where a passage led deeper into the rock. It twisted around on itself and led down, ending in a chamber with a glowing, pulsing, swirling orb of multi-colored fog. Talia walked straight up to it and motioned toward it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Shan should take a heavy hit going through - disorientation, dizziness, etc. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stepped through first, experiencing a strange cold blast, then emerging into a small courtyard. It was surrounded by tall buildings, with a tiny fountain in the center. Directly across from where I emerged was a wall of windows, looking into a shop selling beverages of some kind. It was half filled with a wide variety of races. To my left was a single door in a wall with darkened windows, to my right a narrow passage led out into a swirling mass of beings, and behind me was a section of wall with a door to a bakery of some kind next to it. The sounds of hundreds of languages pounded my ears, while scents from exotic purfumes, food, spices, and other unknown items assoulted my nostrils. The tiny souk under the Arakov Market was nothing compared to what surrounded me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia came through, smiling as she took everything in. "I love the Souk, but it does take some getting used to. The first door in the end wall, to the left, leads to the Neutral Zone, the Asylum run bar. The door next to it leads to the Asylum itself. Beside us is Rishkahn's Bakery and across the way is Myrathium Kavla, a kind of coffee shop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kavla? Asylum?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kavla is like coffee, only much more complex of flavor and with a steadier buzz. The Asylum is based on the old definition, a place of refuge and sanctuary for those seeking a rest from the multi-verse. Would you like to sample kavla, venture into the Great Souk, or find a quiet room in the Asylum to get your bearings?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I started across the courtyard while saying,"Kavla, please." Theshop was larger than it appeared through the wndows, with a door across, opening into another section of the souk. Small clusters of chairs and tables were scattered around the room, about half of them filled. A short, feathered being lounged behind the counter, watching as I approached.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia followed close behind and spoke something in a whistling, clicking language. A few moments later two large mugs of steaming dark brew was set on the counter. Talia pulled out a few coins, stamped from strangely colored metals, and set them on the counter. She led the way to a table looking out into the busy passage of the souk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Moments later the door opened, revealing a large man, dressed in leather armor. "May the asylum help you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We four seek refuge and quiet for a small portion of the day," Talia responded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Enter and be at peace." He stiffened as I walked through the door, then bowed low. "Pardon me, mistress, I believe the head of the asylum would wish to greet you, if that is ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Umm, ah, sure, that would be fine," I said. He conducted us to a rather grand chamber just off the hall the door had opened to. "Irishkah will be with you shortly. Please, enjoy the refreshments provided and rest in comfort."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The room had plush couches, a table spread with various foods, some recognizable, many not. There were bottles of liquids and a gently steaming samova labeled with an unreadable tag, which Talia translated as 'kavla'. She motioned to the food and provided brief descriptions of the items she recognized. That left over half of them unknown.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had just settled down with a plate of some of the more adventurous items when the door opened. A stately woman entered, seeming to glide across the floor. She was average height and build, with thick, short hair that looked almost like feathers. Here eyes were red, her skin lightly tanned, and her face thin, angular, and exotic, beautiful, but not pretty. She was dressed in a simple robe of light blue, which revealed just enough to let her curves show while remaining modest. She bowed as she said, "Greetings, I am Irishkah and I am the madame of this place. Welcome to Sphere and the The Asylum. It is rare that a Strange Attractor comes to Sphere. May I ask what brings you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was told going through a gate would help as a strange."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talia wanted to show me something different, something more than the realm I'm from. Does that count?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's so much more to your destiny. Who is training you? Where is your support team?" Irishkah asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are none. I'd heard there was, once, long ago, but no more," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see. So you know nothing of your role in the multi-verse?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right, no one knows enough to tell me what I'm supposed to know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have someone that can explain, if you would like."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok if everyone hears this, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is up to you, as the Strange." Irishkah stepped out of the room for a few moments, then returned. "Aylytha will be here momentarily. She is a priestess of Ishra and is schooled in the ways of the Stranges."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* are the Arakovs allowed to tag along, how does that work with police procedure? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider for later - maybe things happening earlier are to call/allow this to occur? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, I'll...Aaarrrg..." Terror chased its way up my spine, followed by chills and shakes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mason? Mason, what's going on?" Bishop's voice called from the phone, distant in my ears.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something big, something at the Salmanosom Museum. We need to get there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mason, what about the dogs?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They won't be anything when compared to the museum. Wasn't there an opening there tonight? An exhibit of dark magic art?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shit! Where are you? I'll send a cruiser." I told her. "Be outside, five minutes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hung up and turned to Talia. "I'm coming with you. No arguments," Talia said before I could speak.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure? There's a good chance they will find out who and what you are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok. Helping is more important than hiding."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They probably won't let you in the cruiser," I started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They will, just get the back door open somehow," Talia said through a strange smile. She fingered a ring on her finger and faded from sight. I could still see a faint outline of her, if the light was just right.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A cruiser pulled up just as Talia faded out. "Mason."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Polina? They called you out for this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I can hold my own, if needed. Get in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you open the back? I'd like to drop my spare costume bits in the back." She flipped a switch and I opened the back door. Talia slid in after I had tossed my fake weapon and cloak in. We accellerated away at a fast pace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Detective Bishop and the rest of the team were waiting outside the museum. "All the way up," I called as I climbed out of the car. When everyone turned, I opened the door and let Talia out, then followed them into the building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mason, take the lead," Bishop said as she motioned me to the front of the team. I set off at a fast pace, up the spiral ramp to the upper gallery areas. The miasma reached me first, a feeling of dread, despair, and doom. We rounded the last turn and ran into the first of the aflicted. They were staggering around, blank eyed and disoriented. Drool leaked from their mouths and their hands were curled into claws.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've heard of these things. They slip in through insecurities, then feed on the despair. They don't have real forms, just vague shadows from the energy they project. Darkness will weaken them," Talia's voice whispered from a shadow at my side.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do we get rid of them?" I whispered back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bishop, have you seen anything like this before?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, we haven't. Ideas?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I reached out and tried to see. Slowly the miasma solidified into tendrils reaching through a partially open door. Sculpted figures, in rough workmen's clothing, were lined up outside the door and the piece was captioned 'Waiting for the Employment Office'. "I think we need to close the door on the 'Employment Office' piece. First we need to reduce the light, something about being able to cast shadows makes it stronger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* halloween - start at Midnight Garden - possibility - incursion by hell hounds in the park while something more serious seeks additional pieces of majik for whatever Gladius is searching for */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">I went back to school the next day, intending to finish the term before deciding what to do next. Detective Bishop continued to pull me out of classes from time to time. We were always too late to catch the Yelgezeth.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I started studying magic at Ezra's Magic Shop after school, making some progress in control and access. It was hard going because I struggled with disbelief at critical moments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was early December, just after classes ended, when my mom called me from the museum. "Could you come to my office? I need to talk." Her voice was tight, with a faint tremor underneath. I had only heard her this way once before, when there were mass killings at the museum. I was headed out the door before she finished, coat in hand. Slush puddled on the sidewalk, and splashed up under car wheels. I slid to a halt by James and asked him to get a cab.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He had one in seconds, he was that good, and I settled in for the quick trip to the museum. I walked as fast as I could, without calling too much attention to myself, to mom's office. I stopped at the door, surveying the mess that had been her carefully arranged office. Mom was seated in her chair, dragged into the hallway, stunned. Museum security were inside, looking at various items. "What happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I was in the labs, with Chani, looking at that book I showed you a few weeks back. I needed a reference book and came up to get it." She grabbed my hand, "Let's get coffee."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We headed away from her office, then turned from the way to the cafeteria. "I don't know if I can trust anyone here." She led the way deeper into the museum, down a side passage, and out, into a small courtyard, surrounded by buildings. She looked around carefully before saying, "It's starting again. Penelope Andulasia, in vault inventory, was saying a body was taken out of the basements this morning. I'm surprised you weren't called."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't even hear about it. Did she know which precinct responded?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She didn't. We could ask her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I followed mom into the vaults and basements, past innumerable locked doors, until we stopped at a small office. Inside was a short, thin woman, with wild pink and blue hair, large, black rimmed glasses, and punk atire. She was pacing around the room, shewing on a pen, and talking into a headset microphone, "Ylena Harmon surveyed the stack of crates in the center of her lab, debating whether to start with the remains or the artifacts first. She picked up a pry bar and opened the crate ofremains, slowly lifting out the wrapped bundle and placing it on the large work table. The body was well presered by the dry tomb in which it had rested. 'Let's see what made you lame, shall we?' Ylena muttered to herself as she carefully rolled the body over." The woman jerked suddenly as she saw my mom and I in the doorway, "Oh, Ms. Mason! Sorry, I didn't see you there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pen," mom answered. "This is my daughter Shan. She's a detective with the police. Would you remember which precint responded this morning?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They came from the Park station, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Does the Park station usually respond to museum troubles?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, usually we get officers from the 24th. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You called the 24th to report the incident?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, but other officers responded. It was a bit odd. The museum calls on the police often, to protect various exhibits or shipments. Usually we see the same officers, but no one recognized the ones that came today."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know where they went?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The entry area to the lowest levels. Donnie, um Mr. Rebeki, head of maintenance, found someone torn up in the hall and called it in. He was pretty shaken up, said it was like the last time, all those years ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Were you here for that?" my mom asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had just started an internship in the Middle Eastern section. It was a terrible time! Is it starting again? I don't think I can stay through another round of it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure this wasn't the same thing," I said, even though I didn't believe a word of it. Penelope apparently did, though, giving me a relieved smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks, Pen. I've been meaning to ask, why did you take this job after your internship? You were brilliant in the Middle-East department," my mom added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As long as the inventory is up to date, no one cares if I use the extra time to write. Plus I get to see all the items coming in. I use them to inspire me. Your Tuar't'zani queen has given me a few really good ones already!" She looked down for a moment, the said softly, "She's a hard one. Answers to her questions won't be what you expect."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I heard you narating. Do you write the Archeologist books?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, yes, I do," she replied, face burning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Keep up the good work. I really enjoy them!" She brightened at my words. I waited until we were out of her area before saying, "What was that all about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pen claims the artifacts talk to her. Some days I think they actually might, given what she can say about them. She was telling me someone is optioning her stories for a broadcast series."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should take a look at the area where the body was found. Do you know where she was talking about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was afraid you were going to ask that. I don't know if my keys will get us into those old areas, but we can try." Mom led the way deeper into the warren of hallways and rooms that made up the second sub-basement.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The keys weren't a problem, the police officers standing at the entry were. My badge made no difference to them. They kept insisting the captain ordered them to stop everyone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once we were out of earshot, I said, "Those are private security, not cops. Question is, whose?Is there another way into that section?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Probably, these levels are more like a maze than rooms and hallways. I have no idea of the layout, but Pen would."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Penelope led a twisting path through half lit rooms and dim corridors, explaining that few people ever came this far into the basements. "What's down here?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really old exhibit materials, artifacts, and items donated to the museum that havdn't been cataloged. I keep intending to start, but other tasks keep me busy," Penelope answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She led us to a narrow set of stairs down, near the far end of basement two. A faint tingling began to creep up my back as we went down. "What's in basement three?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Records from the time when the museum was built and first opened. There are also some really old exhibits from the same time. Items that records have been lost for. I have been updating the inventories when I have spare time, but have been doing basement two first."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is back that way?" I asked as I pointed off to the right, where the tingles wanted to pull me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The oldest items and the far wall of this level. You know, it's odd that this basement exists at all. The geological surveys didn't show any reason that this corner of the museum would need additional basements." I started off to the right. "The crime scene is this way," Penelope said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like to look back here first.I think there might be something important." Penelope started to object, shrugged, then led the way toward the back areas. I turned left at the last crossing passage and walked to the third door on the right. "Can we see in this one?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's odd," Penelope said as she slid a key into the lock. "This one isn't stiff at all. Most of the locks down here need quite a bit of work to open."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside, the room was cleared in the center, from the door to the far wall. Shelves had been pushed together, boxes and crates stacked high and off on the sides. I almost ran to the far wall. Something was behind it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Penelope came up beside me, playing her light over the surface. "This has been altered. Look, the bricks in the center don't look the same." Shefelt along the edges of the color variance, then said, What?" just as a brick slid back into the wall. It was followed by a click and then the section of newer looking bricks swung out. A rough passage, cut through the rock, descended into the darkness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I led the way, touch flashing from side to side as we went down. The passage bent to the left after one hundred meters. A glow came from further down, around a bend to the right. We rounded the second bend and saw a gate bubble another hundred meters ahead. I stopped in my tracks as my mom and Penelope came up behind me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is that?" mom asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a Gate, a portal, but it shouldn't be here. This will take you from this world to another, if you step into it. There's one under the Arakov Market in the Village. It's how the shadow people get on and off this world. I have to call Detective Bishop. This is very serious!"</p>

<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">The sound of nails being pulled was followed by the sounds of sticky hinges. When Talia spun around we saw one of the doors was open. A staircase descended to a partially opened door. Around the stair was blackness. The door opened onto the long side of a garden courtyard. The area was fifteen feet across and thirty or so long. Carefully tended plants grew in two long beds around a central fountain. It was a simple fountain, a single jet of water cascading into the basin with a fresh, pleasant sound. High walled buildings surrounded us with windows masked by ornately carved wooden screens.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My vision snowed out again for a second, throwing the room into a weird high-light of brilliance and deep, almost oozing shadows, then cleared again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. My vision's been strange since I woke up. Every so often it will turn all snowy and wavy, like the really old televisions when they couldn't get a signal. It only lasts a moment, just long enough to notice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Any pain, headache, dizziness, nausea?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, just a moment of strange shadows and high-lights, then another burst of static and back to normal. Did you scan my head when you were testing me? Did you see anything strange?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not that would explain the vision issues, no. You did have very high brain activity, higher than many normal scans even, while in the coma.
