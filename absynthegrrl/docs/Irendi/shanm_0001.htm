<p class="pagecaption">Tearing the Veil</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My ears woke up first, to the sounds of a heart monitor, voices in the distance, and paging speakers. Next came smell, disinfectant and cheap food. Vision returned last, snowy and wavery, like the really old analog television sets, when they weren't getting a good signal. Slowly I could make out a shape in a white coat standing next to me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, you're awake. Please, hold still a minute and let me get the feeding tube out." The figure resolved into a darker skinned woman as she carefully pulled a long tube out of my nose. I closed my eyes hard and opened them several times, trying to get them working. The snow faded a bit each time until I could mostly see her features. She was East Asian, but I wasn't sure which country of origin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm Dr. Kim and I have been attending you. Do you know who you are?" I nodded and managed to whisper my name, through my very dry throat. "Thirsty?" I gave a small nod and she waved at a nurse. A moment later she tipped a few ice chips into my mouth from a small cup. "Do you know what happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you remember?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I remember being at work, at the Arakov Market near my home. I think something stung me. I remember feeling very sick a little while later. Then I woke up here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stung? We found a bite on your left hand, but it wasn't a sting, there was no stinger. There was a bit of irritation, but none of the usual spider toxins in the tissues. What sort of allergies run in your family?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I was adopted when I was a baby and never knew my birth parents. How long have I been here?" I had lost track of how many times I had to explain why my parents looked nothing like me. They were average Meriksans, a little thick with age, but they both turned heads. My features were pure Nehtanese, slightly up-turned almond eyes, long, thin face with very high cheek bones, narrow chin, and a wide mouth. Like everyone, I didn't believe I was beautiful, but I was exotic enough to turn heads. I had to turn away the boys that came panting after me. I wasn't comfortable with their attention, it distracted from focusing on dancing and was vaguely disturbing as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Four days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Four days? When can I go home? I have to be at Davisson School on Sunday to start new student orientation and I'm not ready!" Being accepted to Davisson had been the pinncale of my summer. I had worked through high school to keep my grades up and perfect my dancing in the hopes I could audition and be accepted. It was a world reknown school of theatre, dance, and music, located in the heart of the Jefferson Centre for the Performing Arts. I struggled to sit up, but my vision snowed out and dizziness forced me back down. "Ok, not today, I guess." I looked around the room at the wires and tubes attached to me and tried to stay calm. "Any chance some of these attachments can come off?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Some of the monitors can come off. The IV needs to stay in a while longer. I want to monitor you tonight, make sure you can eat and drink without problems, then move you to a normal room tomorrow. If you are doing well by tomorrow night, I will consider releasing you. I'll check in on you in the morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where are my parents? In the movies, they are sitting with me while I'm in a coma."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They have been allowed to see you, but not to stay. You are in Trauma 3, a special ward for the more exotic cases."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's wrong with me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She hesitated for a long while before speaking, "It's complicated, not because I don't know what happened, but the explanation is going to sound very strange. You're only the second case of this I've seen. A spider bit you, but it wasn't toxic in the usual way. It carries a venom that Awakens its victim, strips away the mind's ability to ignore things that don't fit normal perceptions. That's difficult enough, but I know what to test for. What happened to you was more complicated and I had to really dig to figure it out. In one in ten thousand cases a genetic condition in the target triggers a viral contaminant and causes a genetic rewrite of the victim. This is extremely dangerous because of convulsions, high fever, and disruption to the biology of the host. You proved amazingly well adapted to the conversion. Your symptoms, while severe, were never life threatening and the process ended in four days. It can take as long as two weeks in less sturdy hosts."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did it do to me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's hard to say. The results are varied and can take a while to become apparent. That's the easy part." Dr. Kim stopped again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's the hard part? Will I turn into a wolf with the full moon?" I asked with a smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, therianthropy isn't transmitted by spiders, or mosquitos either, thankfully," she answered seriously. "Do you like science fiction or fantasy?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Urban fantasy more than science fiction, but I read and watch both. Why? Wait, what? Are you saying lycanthropy is real?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, though it is fortunately extremely rare. Would you say that you have an idea of what being able to see things others can't is like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess, at least how writers protray it," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She continued, "The rewrite has Awakened you to that state. This world contains gates that lead to other places. Doorways to other-wheres that Awakened, or aware, beings can use to travel. There is a lot more to explain, but the best people to do it are the women running Ezra's Magic Shop. They know a lot more about how this works than I do. Once you are released, I seriously recommend you talk to them. I also recommend you get training in how to fight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What if I don't want it? I mean it's cool and all, but I want to be a dancer, not some shadow fighter. Leave it to people who enjoy that kind of conflict. Every story I know states there is a high price for this kind of ability. What if I'd rather not pay it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The price is your transformation. The choice is always yours, however, don't be surprised if your choice isn't respected. The transformation is not reversible. I seriously recommend talking to the people at Ezra's. Do you know where it is?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Near the original Arakov Market, in the Village, right?" Dr. Kim nodded. "I'll think about it. Where are my parents? When can I go home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm going to keep you overnight. In the morning we will take you to a room in the main hospital and let your parents in to collect you. Now, I'd like you to sleep, so I'm putting you back under for the night. You shouldn't have as much trouble waking up in the morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>


<p class="regtxt5">I drifted awake in another room. My eyes opened to grey shadows. Watery light, tinted just the faintest of yellow spilled into the room. Everywhere the shadows were deep and rich, layered into multiple shades of grey and black. Dim red eyes flickered in them. My mom and dad were sitting next to the bed, as grey as the rest of the surroundings. Dr. Kim was telling them I should be awake in moments. She was in full color. Panic settled in as the drugs faded further. Dr. Kim rushed everyone out when I struggled to speak, unable to get much more out than, "Wha, wha's happening? Oh gods!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's wrong? Are you ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They're grey. Why is the room grey? Why are my parents grey? Why are you in color? What the hell is going on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I told you that you became a Strange Attractor, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A Strange what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A Strange Attractor, that's what the Awakened call those like you. Each Strange gets different abilities and effects. In your case detecting Awakened by color is one of yours. There may be other effects that manifest later. The only consistent side effect is better healing. Trauma 3 was set up for Awakened. The rest of the hospital wasn't. Obviously I am an Awakened. Your parents wouldn't be. Can I let them back in? You scared them pretty badly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not yet. I can't go around color blind. Can you do anything about this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Not really, no. Maybe they have something at Ezra's, but there's nothing I can do medically to fix you. I wouldn't tell your parents."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't tell you parents what's going on, not even the color blindness, not until you talk to the Bishop sisters at Ezra's. They might be able to give you something so you can see, and that would be hard to explain. As for the rest, you might Awaken them, but more likely they'd think you suffered brain damage from your illness."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fuck, ok. Let them in," I said with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She went to the door, opened it, and said, "She should be ok now. Just a bad reaction to coming out from under the meds we've been giving her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My mom slowly approached, leaned in, and carefully hugged me around all the attachments. My mother and father took turns telling me what had been happening during the last few days.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you been taking care of yourselves?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can always take care of ourselves. It's you we've been worried about!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm in good hands here. I know you want to be here for me and I appreciate it, but it's ok for you to take care of yourself as well. You don't have to stay here for me all the time. I'm not that good of company anyway, being tired, sore, and uncomfortable."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My dad turned to Dr. Kim and asked, "When can we take her home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tomorrow. I would like one more night to make sure the meds don't cause any more trouble and to make sure there aren't any unexpected after effects of her illness."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talia would like to see you, when you are up for it," mom added. She hesitated before saying, "You know that girl has a serious crush on you, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talia? You're kidding, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, very serious. She only leaves the waiting area for work, or when we kick her out to get some sleep. You should be careful not to hurt her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She told you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not directly, but the way she was asking about you, the shattered but hopeful look on her face in the waiting areas, and that she is here every moment she can be, told me. I know your thoughts on relationships right now, but try to be kind, I really like her. Should I let her know you'd be ok seeing her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, you can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mom dialed her phone and talked a few minutes before saying, "She'll be here this afternoon, after her shift."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could take off this afternoon, let Talia keep me company for a little bit, then they'll probably put me to sleep early this evening anyway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure? We're worried about you, you know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, and I love you and dad for it. I'll be ok today and I'll see you in the morning, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She nodded slowly and went to the door. Just after they took away my lunch tray Talia bounded in, "Hey, how are you doing? You going to be ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm..." my voice trailed off as I saw her. She was in full color, but the face I knew was flickering and fuzzing, like a scifi movie bad holographic effect over the top of another face.  She was average height, with light blonde hair, and freckle covered pale skin. She would have been pretty if she would dress in things other than ratty hand me downs from her brother sand would take an interest in the state of her hair. I had tried a few times to talk to her about it, being no stranger to the usefulness of exotic beauty myself, but she had no interest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly the face I knew faded into a different face, lightly tanned, more angular, with bone white hair and a row of three small horns, starting at her hair line and ending at the peak of her skull. Her mouth was wider, with generous, full lips, a wider, more sensuous nose, emerald eyes with cat pupils instead of round ones, and pointed ears showing through her hair. Her teeth were sharper and whiter, her cheek bones higher and more pronounced, and she was a lot more muscular than I had thought.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shan, are you ok? Why are you staring at me?" Talia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm just so happy to see you," I replied quickly, unsure what else to say. Her face lit up with a wide smile as she replied, "I'm very glad you are ok. I don't like hospitals or seeing my l...," it was Talia's turn to stumble over her words, "friends in them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We talked for a the rest of the afternoon and through dinner, then Dr. Kim came in. "Ms. Mason needs her rest. You can come back in the morning when her parents come to take her home."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>


<p class="regtxt5">I woke slowly to Dr. Kim watching from near the bed. "How are you this morning?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Still seeing in black and white, but otherwise ok, I think."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Try slowly standing and let me know if there is dizziness, nausea, or extreme weakness. You'll be a bit unsteady from being in bed for four days, but you should be able to stand and walk slowly." I eased myself out of bed, gripped the rail for a moment as I waited for my balance to settle, then slowly walked around the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Things seem ok," I replied after a few minutes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good! I'll let your parents know they can get you after lunch."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When my parents came, I was wheeled to a cab. I had wanted to walk, but the nurses insisted I use the wheel chair. The ride home was difficult, trying to pretend nothing was wrong while looking at a grey world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dad ordered in my favorite foods for dinner and we sat and talked about what had happened. I could tell they were frustrated that I didn't know more. Mom would tear up when she thought I wasn't looking. After a long silence my dad asked if I was going to keep working at the market near our place. When I said yes, he got even more quiet. "Look, I could have been bitten anywhere. It wasn't the Arakov's fault. I was planning to see him tomorrow and see when I could start up again. I want to contribute to my school costs," I told him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I understand that, but we aren't so poor that we can't fund school. We want you to focus on learning, so you can get the best possible jobs when you are done. Besides, didn't the orientation letters tell you to avoid commitments outside Davisson and focus on your studies? Everyone agrees you could easily be a lead dancer almost anywhere, even now. If you pick up some business schooling on the side, you can run your own company or dance related business if anything happens to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I just don't want to feel like a parasite and I like Talia's family and helping them out. I'll let him know about the school recommendations."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please, just be careful," my mom added. "You have no idea how hard it is to see you lying on a bed, in an isolation chamber, wondering if you are going to live or die. I don't want to see that again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The evening was long and awkward, with everyone heading off to bed as soon as was possible.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next morning they hovered around me as they got ready to go off to their days. I suffered through it, acting as cheerful as I could, until they finally left. Once they were gone I threw on clothes and headed for the subway. Reading the signs and arrows was much harder without the color coding that made the process easy. Nothing was too strange until I started walking toward the market from the W 4 St. station. All the buildings on the east side of 6th were in color, everything to the west wasn't. As I turned the corner onto Waverly the color hit me like a wave. Everything was in hyper-color, over-saturated, like a photograph were the color is pushed hard. It beat on my eyes until I had a roaring headache by the time I was in front of Ezra's Magic Shop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The windows were lined with magic kits, simple tricks, and novelties. Inside the front area was cluttered with shelves of more. The further into the shop I went the more esoteric things became. The easy kid's party tricks were replaced with books on magic, rolled up blue prints for old trick apparatus that were no longer considered secret. At the very back I thought I had stepped into an old style apothecary shop. Bottles of powders, potions, and indescribable things cluttered high shelves. A worn counter sat on a glass case filled with various knives, mortars, pestles, and other herbalist gear. As I was trying to read some of the labels, the bead curtain between two tall shelves parted and a woman dressed in movie gypsy clothes walked in. She was my height with black hair, dark brown eyes, and an Eastern European face. "Oh, hello. I thought someone came in. How may I help you?" she asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um, hi, um, I, uh, Dr. Kim says hi," I stammered out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you be Kilashandra Mason, then? I'm Olivia Bishop, one of the owners. Dr. Kim said you might stop by. Let me make sure we won't be disturbed, then we can go upstairs and talk." She hurried to the front of the store, then came back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about customers?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The ones we care about will come again, the others, well, there aren't that many anyway." She motioned me to precede her through the curtain. It led into a standard stock room, with a stairway up the left side. Upstairs was a richly appointed sitting room, done in movie style gypsy colors and patterns. Light streamed in through the large front windows. "Please, sit. Now what can I do for you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I settled slowly into the large armchair. It enfolded me perfectly, the most comfortable chair I had ever sat in. "Can you tell me what is going on? What is a Strange Attractor? Can you tell me why I see most of the world in grey scale? Do you have something for a raging headache as well? Your street is in hyper-color and it's too much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The grey scale is easy. Awakening changes everyone in some way. I think we have something that can help with that. There'll still be a difference between multi-versal things and single realm ones, but it should bring most of it back. Give me a moment to get a couple of possibilities." She went back down the stairs, returning several minutes later with a hand full of various items. "Ok, hold each of these and see which one works best. You want something that lets you concentrate easily to turn off the effect, but that knocks it back enough that you can function and that restores most of the color. It's ok if you want to go back a block, outside this enclave of Awakened. Keep them all in this silk cloth and only touch the one you are testing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I returned a few minutes later, after testing all of the items, pointed at two, and said, "The first one gives the best color. The second one is the easiest to switch with, but the color isn't as good. Problem is, how do I wear any of these while dancing? I start the Davisson dance program this Sunday."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can make you ear studs that combine the best properties of your two picks. They should be ready by the end of the week."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How much will I owe you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can work out something you can afford. Now, on to multi-verse 101, or how the true world works. First, some terms. A multi-verse is the collection of all things that comprise current creation. Within the multi-verse are worlds. Worlds are places that contain various races, beings, and circumstances. Each world contains one or more realms. Realms are single instances of beings and things. For example, you are a single instance of all possible Kilashandra Mason's in all the realms forming the world you call "Earth". There are ways to travel through the multi-verse. This realm started to explore space, that is a simple travel method, but a valid one. It takes longer and is more limited than other ways. Hyperspace or warp or whatever you want to call faster than light travel is better, but still limited in how many realms can be touched. Then there are Gates. Gates don't open onto every realm either, but they can be artificially created on an as-needed basis using basic research and powerful technology or magic. Then there are various magical constructs and artifacts, as well as some beings with natural travel powers. The reality is even more complicated than this simple explanation, but this gets the basics across. Does it make sense so far?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, I don't know. Seems a bit like an urban fantasy novel or some new-agey pabulum more than reality."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Olivia laughed. "New age has nothing to do with reality, any more than any belief system. Beliefs are about how you want things to be, whether it is real or not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did Dr. Kim mention anything about me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean that you are a Strange Attractor? Yes, she did. Stranges deal with Gate Leak, for want of a better term. There is a group that goes from realm to realm securing the permanent gates to keep the worst things out, but the seals aren't perfect. The only way to completely seal a permanent gate is to destroy it, and that is a very difficult task indeed. As a Strange Attractor you are attuned to the gates of your realm. When nasty things come through, you work to suppress them. You will be drawn to them and they will be drawn to you. My sister, Mira, and I can help you with any magic you might have acquired through your change, however, I would strongly recommend you talk to Martin Esterhaaz about fighting training as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Magic I might have picked up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She must have seen the skepticism in my eyes as she replied, "Yes, magic. Not illusion like the kits we sell at the front of the store, but real magic. Real magic is a way of manipulating matter and energy to get desired results. It can be studied, learned, and expanded upon, just like any other technology. Most Stranges have magic abilities in one form or another. We can help you determine what form yours takes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hold on, I don't want to fight, or learn magic, or anything else. I just want to go back to my life as a dancer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm afraid it isn't that simple. Once you are Awakened, there's no 'un-awakening' possible. I respect your desire not to fight, but the multi-verse may not give you a choice. I will, however. Just remember, we are here in case you need us. This was a lot to take in. Do you have any questions?" she asked as she handed me a card. "This is my private number. Call or stop in when you have more questions. Would you like to borrow these two items until the end of the week? I know what their spells are, so I can make your studs without needing them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I would. May I stay here for a bit and see if the headache will calm down?" She nodded and I remained for another half hour. We talked about random things off and on between pleasant silences.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During one of them, I used my phone to check the work schedules at the nearby Arakov Market. I wasn't sure what I was going to say to Talia after the hospital stay and wanted to be sure she was working at another store. Satisfied, I finally stood and made my exit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Out on the street the colors were back to almost normal as I strode the short distance to the market. Mr. Arakov understood when I explained about school and schedules, reassuring me that I could always return to work when things settled down. He also apologized profusely for what happened. I kept reassuring him that he wasn't at fault. If he had one weakness, it was that he tended to be nice, even when a bit of hardness would help.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I made it home later than I had planned, but still long before my parents did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>


<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">School started in a whirlwind right after dorm check-in. Orientation was intense immersion and classes continued the pressure. Dorm life was difficult at first. I had never lived with other people so closely before. There were many things I had to adjust to, from the periodic wait for one of our bathrooms, to cleaning chores, to how not to trip over the others. It would have been harder if each of us hadn't been so busy. Many nights it was return to the rooms and fall into bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Each dorm suite had five bed rooms, two and a half baths, and a common area. Three were double rooms and two were singles, for returning upper class students. Marta, my bedroom mate, and I had been corresponding through the summer, ever since our housing assignments. It made moving in with her easier. She was a nervous person, with half of her questions being about what Yew Nork was like, if there was a lot of crime, and other uneasy questions. She was a drama student, and that summed up her first days. I found her sticking close to me for every part of orientation, except when we had to be with our own division. I think she would have dropped out right away, if it hadn't been for the calm of the orientation leader and my efforts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta was thin, with luxurious wavy black hair, and wide, dark brown eyes, in a long oval face. I liked her, even as she shadowed me. Her confidence increased a bit once classes began and more structure was introduced to her life. She didn't see it, but she was an excellent actress, scoring the coveted role of the nurse in Romeo and Juliet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta talked me into participating in Romeo and Juliet, as one of the crowd and dancers at the party. It was fun, although, the drama between actors was even worse than the drama between dancers. Marta was adept at slipping past the ego wars, although she couldn't see it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was mid October and we had finished the last performance of Romeo and Juliet. Marta and I were heading down my shortcut out of the theatre. I would leave through the theatre loading dock, walk down the driveway, and to the street beyond. From there, it was easy to slip into the side entrance to the Tyler building and up to our dorm room. I had missed Marta in the dressing rooms, so was 20 meters behind her when a strange patch of darkness caught my eye. It was forming almost under the light mid way down the drive, coalescing into a solid figure, appearing slightly behind her. I didn't think about it, just ran after Marta, slamming into the figure as it was about to reach out and grab her. "Run!" I yelled as the figure spun at me, stabbing its hand into my side. Pain exploded and I staggered back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It shoved me down, leaned over, and hissed, "I will taste your sweetness later, my pretty." What I saw up close was terrifying. It was impossibly thin, tall, with a sharp twisted face. Long claws protruded from stubby fingers. A long tongue snaked out, tasting the air, like a lizard or snake. Its eyes were flat black and dead looking and its breath smelled like rotting blood.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shan," Marta called weakly, turning and starting back toward me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Run Marta, run!" I screamed at her, although pain turned it into a hissing whisper instead. The figure rose, turned, and started toward her. I reached out and locked my hands on its legs. The claws slashed down, carving tracks across the right side of my face. Blood half blinded me and my grip started to slip. It twisted and got loose. Marta was running for the street and the terror was turning to give chase. "No!" I hissed as I pulled my legs under me and shoved myself up and at the thing. It started to spin back, sinking its claws in my side again. I shoved my hands against its chest and hissed "No!" again. Pain, rage, and terror fueled a white hot explosion in my hands. I saw magenta streamers sizzle through its chest, vaporizing a trail across it. The body fell in two pieces and fizzed away into thin oily smoke. I dropped to my knees and then face down into the alley.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once more I woke to hospital noises and smells. I opened my eyes and pawed at them, trying to get them to clear. Bandages around my right eye interfered with much of the view. My mom was sitting at my bedside again, pale and washed out with worry. I wasn't really surprised when Dr. Kim walked in a few minutes later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What were you thinking, running into trouble like that?" my mom asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I couldn't stand back and watch. There wouldn't have been time to get security."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She half smiled, half grimaced and shook her head. "Do you have any idea how fortunate you were? Just a fraction of an inch and they would have been frantically trying to fix your insides. As it is, there will likely be scars from the ragged knife wounds you had."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My eyes widened in surprise and I started to say something until Dr. Kim barely shook her head. "I know, but I couldn't let it, him, get to Marta. Did they catch him?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no they didn't," my mom replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's a police detective who would like to speak with you when you are ready. She would like to get a statement while events are fresh in your memory. Your dorm mates are out there, too, waiting for word. They can come in, one at a time, if you and your parents agree," Dr. Kim added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, I can talk to the detective, if you think I'm not too drugged up. I'd like to see my friends after the detective."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you feel coherent? If so, you're probably ok," Dr. Kim replied. She poked her head out the door and motioned to someone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hello, I'm Detective Bishop." She stopped and looked at my mom a moment, "Ms.Mason, how are you? I haven't seen you since the museum problem a few years ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm fine, Detective Bishop. All's quiet at the museum these days, thanks. I know you will get to the bottom of this attack on my daughter."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May I have a few moments alone with her to go over what happened?" She was tall and slender, with dark black hair, dark eyes, and a faint accent, making her seem very familiar. My mom and Dr. Kim looked at me. I shrugged and nodded. Once they had stepped out of the room, Detective Bishop pulled a small recorder from her pocket and asked, "Mind if I record this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can record us," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She switched it on, placed it on the small table near my bed, and said, "It's not really a recorder. It's a sound damper, in case someone outside gets too curious." The detective pulled out a sketch pad and flipped it open to a page, then turned it so I could see it. "Is this what attacked you?" On the pad was a sketch almost perfectly mirroring the tall, thin creature that had attacked me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There have been witnesses to previous attacks and the damage done to you matches that done to the other victims. What did you do to it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you think I did something?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you hadn't, you and Ms. Coseco would be in the morgue."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How is Marta?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Physically, she is fine. Otherwise, she's very confused, at least that's what we've let her believe. Her mind doesn't want to accept what she saw. Dr. Kim's team have been subtly suggesting she doesn't remember well from the trauma. I think they are going to release her today."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was more seriously injured than I am feeling right now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You will have to ask Dr. Kim about that. Now, what did you do to it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's going on here? Who are you, really?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am Detective Nikki Bishop with YNPD," she fished her badge out and showed it to me. "I am also Olivia Bishop's sister. She told me there was a new Strange in town. I was going to contact you, but she said to leave you alone, something about choices you wanted to make. Can you tell me what you did?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I dissipated it, somehow. Something I did caused it to dissolve into black vapor and drift away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. It was attacking Marta and I was fading out. I screamed at it, grabbed it, shoved at it and somewhere during that violet light flashed from my hands and, and, vaporized its chest. Oh gods, I killed it. I killed something." I stared at my hands, for a moment seeing it happening in my memory.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You actually might have. Congratulations, those things are very hard to put down. The thing you killed was a Yelgezeth. It is a feeder for a Belgezyeleth, a nasty fear sucking over-demon. I won't burden you with details just now, since we shouldn't take a lot of time. You can come to Police Plaza and talk to me if you'd like more information. Ask for me and someone will show you to my office. Here is my card with my private number on the back. Call me any time. You can also call my sisters, their numbers are on the card as well. Don't try to do this alone. You aren't invulnerable, or a super being, even as a Strange."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective," she paused, her finger almost on the button, "are there a lot of Awakened? Is there a secret handshake or anything when I see someone that is?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's never been a census done. I know there are quite a few, in pockets, in the city. Probably more scattered around. There's no club or anything. It would be like asking someone's sexual preference. You ask when it feels appropriate in your relationship. Now, I really better let your mom back in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just one more question. What really killed the people at the museum three years ago? "</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't what attacked you, but it wasn't human either. We found it and neutralized it, but couldn't release that fact. We had to use the 'the perpetrator must have been incarcerated for some other crime' line for the official story."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, you can let them back in." She switched off the device, placed it back in her pocket, and left the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My mom and Dr. Kim came back in. My mom sat by the bed, holding my hand, while Dr. Kim checked various things. "You should be able to go home tomorrow. The wounds aren't that serious and I've been dropping the pain med dosage all morning. I'd like one more night to get the drugs out of your system. I'll have your discharge papers ready before noon tomorrow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once Dr.Kim was finished, my dorm mates came through, each one asking how I was doing. Bethany thanked me for saving Marta, as well as asking how I was and when I was getting out. Sheri brought dance class notes and a message of concern from Ms.Korikova, the cast iron hard ass that was our basic ballet teacher.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia arrived just after lunch, after the others had gone, laptop bag in hand. "Are you ok? What happened? When did you wake up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm ok, I guess. Everyone says it could have been a lot worse. The cl...knife wounds weren't all that deep or bad. I should be able to go home tomorrow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, um, I want to ask what happened, but if you don't want to talk about it, I won't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't remember a lot," I replied, then told her the very basics of what had happened, leaving out the non-human nature of the attacker.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But where did he hide? I've seen that area, there are no shadows."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stared at her for a long time, thinking about her question and what Detective Bishop had said. "I see you," I said slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, silly, I'm standing right here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I see a different you, white hair with small horns, darker skin with red high-lights. We were attacked by something from beyond, something that created its own shadow, then stepped out of it." Talia stared at me, forcing me to slowly continue, "It started last summer, when I was bitten. I didn't really know then. Everything is grey-scale, except those that are touched by more than this world. I see you, in what I guess is your true form, in living color. My mom is grey, this room is grey, the city beyond the window is grey. Only an item from Ezra's lets me see the normal world with color."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia almost fell into the nearest chair, babbling,  "Oh, wow, that's so cool! You can see though the shell image, see the true me? That shouldn't be possible, even for an Awakened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shell image? What's that? Dr. Kim called me a Strange Attractor..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked! I've never met a Strange before. What's it like? You're like heroes to the rest of us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know what it's like other than the vision thing, and, maybe some type of healing advantage. I should have been dead when the emergency team arrived." Talia turned pale at that.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can tell you what I know about being awake, but later, after you get home, come to my place and I'll tell you. I don't feel safe talking about things like that here." She rose and grabbed my hands in hers, "Look, there's beauty beyond the veil too. I can show you the Mirror Souk and the Village as I see it. Maybe I can even show you Sphere. Sphere will blow you mind!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia sat on the edge of the bed, her hands still holding mine. "So, you missed the most awesome and weird news," her green, cat pupiled eyes were sparkling with excitement, "CyCore Games is being taken over by Rani Corp and the mega-corp is funding their next MMO, Realms of the Hut, scheduled for four years from now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"CyCore? Oh, right Conflict for Mars and the Shadow Journey series. Rani Corp, isn't that the mega-corp that took on the government a few years ago over privacy concerns?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, they sent out the encryption systems and instructions to all their subscribers and refused to give the government agencies access to the keys, code, and data traffic. Said they'd have to provide warrants for any snooping and that they would only support it on a case by case, person by person, basis. Pretty ballsy of them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Worked though. So what's the new MMO about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here, take a look," Talia answered as she flipped her laptop so I could see the announcement.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">CyCore Games, creator of 'Conflict for Mars' and the Shadow Journeys series, announces development of a new massively multi-player online role playing game for personal computers and gaming stations. Taking place in the multi-verse, 'The Realms of the Hut' places the players in the conflicts between the powers and forces conspiring to dominate the known worlds.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In The Realms of the Hut, anything could be true. Portals between worlds can be found anywhere. Enemies and allies lurk everywhere, in the depths of the Abyss, in the groves of the Elysian Fields, and monsters really do hide under the bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Journey alone or join forces with your friends and seek out the truths behind the myths, battle the forces seeking power, rise to rule your own regions, and create your own legends. The fate of the multi-verse is in your hands.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">For more information see roth.cycore.com.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now here's the really cool part. Check out this email I got after signing up on the site." She opened the email, scrolled rapidly past the part where she was welcomed to the forums and clicked on a link at the bottom. An image came up in a browser of a heart shaped stone, a rock shadowing it, and a sun in the background. The rest of the image was a dry desert scene. Talia dragged the stone into the sun and a new screen opened, showing an eight sided room with a boarded over door in every other wall. The other four walls were floor to ceiling shelves of books. In the center was a small table with an oil lamp burning. Its glow was the only light in the room. There was a small cloth bound book on the table, next to the lamp, and an age darkened, soot streaked bell hanging from the ceiling. A wooden mallet was hanging next to it. "This is as far as I have gotten," she said, clicking on the book and opening it to the first page.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Realms of the Hut takes place across a multi-verse of worlds. On every world there are nexus events occurring between the polarities of all races. These polarities include Law, Order, Chaos, Anarchy, Good, Evil, Light, and Dark. Each player will choose their own ethos and beliefs and these will evolve over time as they explore more of the Realms around them.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">While the choice of Polarity can seem obvious at the first, it is important to remember the multi-verse suffers as much under too much Law as too much Anarchy, too much Good as too much Evil. Because of this, there is a last group, working from the shadows, to prevent the multi-verse from tearing itself apart. These are the Keepers of the Balance. The exact ways in which Keepers are recruited is not known, only that some are called and few accept.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Within the Realms of the Hut your character's actions will change the face of destiny across the multi-verse. There will be epic battles between the various Polarities as each group strives for supremacy. Sometimes the fate of the many depends on the actions of the few. You have the chance to be one of the few and carve your fame across the ages.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's possible to look around the room," Talia moved her hand in the control glove she always wore and the view shifted, as if actually walking around the room. "There are other books on the shelves, but they are ghostly and not useable. You can ring the bell, but nothing..." she broke off as a deep bell tone rolled through the room. "It hasn't done that before." A white shape flickered briefly near the table and then a scrap of parchment dropped on it. Talia picked it up and an insert graphic opened up, showing text and a flashing cursor over a line. The text said, "A rose red city half as old as time" and a small arrow pointing at the blank line.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I reached out and typed "Patrea" even before I said it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you know that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The line was pirated by a Mars novel I read when I was really young. For some reason the phrase stuck. Years later I found out it referenced the capital and trade center of the Zeltaarans." A chime sounded and as it faded a cloth bound book materialized on the table. Talia flipped it open to show a page partially filled with text, neatly hand-written in ink.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Notes of Irena Katarya</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Statics</p>

<p class="regtxt12">A woman once asked me, "Don't you want to settle down, raise a family, become a part of a community?"</p>

<p class="regtxt12">All I could think was, "Only in my worst nightmares. To be ground bound, stuck on some gods forsaken rock, would be a hell from which I would run screaming. I embraced the Hut of All Worlds, the Hut of Margla Fleshfeaster. I reveled in the knowledge that I could go anywhere and any when, and never have I regretted the price of admission."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia and I looked at each other. "On the game web site, where I signed up for the forums and announcements, CyCore announced there would be before launch puzzles and games to generate interest. I was surprised they had a starting event ready with the first emails."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We talked about things at the store, we discussed Conflict for Mars and other games until Dr. Kim and a nurse came in with dinner. Talia dropped my hands like she had been burnt. I grabbed one of her hands and held it until I was sure she knew I was ok with other people seeing it. She smiled shyly as I gave it a gentle squeeze and relaxed my hold.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm about to go off shift, but I need to talk to you first. Would you mind if I stay and talk while you eat?" she looked pointedly at Talia, then at me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I'd like that. It's ok, Talia knows about things. She can stay while we talk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ahzyashteahmzi Ikztuathtea," Talia added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dr. Kim looked momentarily startled, the replied, "And I honor you as well, Gate Born. Shan, you should know that you will heal from most things on your own, and rather quickly. This is common for a Strange. You won't be immortal, massive damage or debilitating illness can still kill you, but this should help keep you alive. It's why you were mostly healed before you arrived here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, what doI tell my parents and people at school? People don't heal this fast."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ideally, nothing. Many people would rather believe the world doesn't have things from Beyond the Veil and their minds will rationalize away a great many oddities. In the end, it is a personal decision based on trust, comfort, and knowing if it will make their lives harder or better. You also need to determine if they are more likely to believe you or consider you dangerously crazy. If you don't want to tell them, I can show you how to change the bandages and make it look like it's taking the usual time to heal. You might want a safe place to stay next time you are injured, somewhere your parents wouldn't be called and wouldn't worry if you didn't come home while you heal."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Monday morning Ms Korikova stopped me as I was headed to the locker room, before her class. She was the head of the dance department and the first year ballet instructor. She had been a world famous dancer before she had retired to join the faculty at Davisson. She was also very severe, never smiling, always correcting, and very curt in her speech. "Mason, a word, my office." I followed slowly, trying to keep my nerves under control. Ms.Korikova only invited people to her office if they were in serious trouble. "Slowly, basic form one." I complied while she watched closely. "You are fit to dance today. The stories made it sound as if you were more seriously injured. You may get ready now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Classes were very hard. I had thought I had recovered, but my body was still very tired. I staggered back to my room and fell onto my bunk, mostly asleep before my head settled into the pillow. I half woke up to the door opening when Marta came in much later. I heard her go to her desk, then to the window. When I opened my eyes, she was staring out the window. After a few minutes she moved closer to the bunks and quietly asked, "Shan, are you asleep?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wanted to talk about, you know, what happened to us Saturday night. I want to thank you for saving my life. Most people would have run or tried to call security. You dashed right in and stopped him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm just glad he ran away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But he didn't. There was so much blood. I saw you fight with it. It wasn't human and you were bleeding to death after you destroyed it. At the hospital, they told me I was confused and I let them believe I was, but I know what I saw."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want me to say?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want you to tell me what really happened. Look, I know they were trying to protect me. When I was really young, I lived where magic was considered normal. I saw strange things, ghosts, monsters in the shadows, and nobody thought it was weird. School, as well as a move to a big city, taught me to never talk about what I saw, but you see it too, don't you? The world beyond our world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hesitated a very long time before I said, "Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I haven't looked into the shadows for so long that I didn't see it at first. Do you look, or have you never had to forget what you can do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't completely turn it off. It's confusing sometimes. Especially in places like this, where there are echoes of everyone who's studied and worried here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She looked around and finally nodded, "I can just make them out, if I concentrate really hard." She remained silent for a while, then blurted out, "How can you look so good today? You, you were face down in a pool of blood after the attack. How could they release you yesterday?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stood and crossed to the window, staring out at the Jefferson Centre spread out below us. Marta slowly moved up to stand next to me and waited. I tried to think of something to explain, without explaining everything. At last I gave up and said, "I was bitten by something and Awakened just before new student orientation. It almost killed me, but when it was over, I could see into the shadows. There are side-effects. I only see this world in black and white without the magic in these." I pointed to my earrings, then continued, "I started healing very fast afterward. It seems I can use magic as well, but I don't really know what it can do yet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We stood, staring out at the world around us, lost in our own thoughts. She finally turned, stripped, and pulled on her pajamas. "It's been a long few days. I'm going to bed now. Thank you for not telling me I'm crazy. One last question, why the bandages?" she asked as she climbed up into her bunk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How would I explain how fast I healed?" I replied, stripping, changing into the large shirt I slept in, and falling back into my bunk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Things stayed quiet until the afternoon of Wodnesday. Detective Bishop was talking to Ms. Korikova and motioned me over. Ms. Korikova stalked off as I approached. "I need you to come with me. I need your help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have class now. Can't this wait?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm tracking another of the things that almost killed you. If we wait, more people will be hurt. You tell me, can this wait?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, let's go," I replied. I hurried after her as she headed for a police cruiser waiting outside. "What did you tell Ms. Korikova?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That we might have found your attacker." We rode along in silence until we reached Police Plaza, where she conducted me inside. We passed through a door labeled "Section 13 - Violent Crime Victims Unit". She led me to a spacious, but spartan office with her name on the door and pointed at a chair. "I should clear up a few things before we get started. The front offices actually deal with victims of exceptionally brutal crimes. The rest of us deal with Veil Events. Officially we don't exist, unofficially, we are called in any time something strange occurs. Our funding comes through a smoke-screened section of the general fund. I would like to attach you as a paid consultant. The salary wouldn't be extravagant, but should give you options. The work you will be called upon to do will interfere with regular employment, I'm sorry to say."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute, I haven't agreed to any of this. All I've ever wanted to do was dance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sometimes decisions get made because most of the options are too terrible to contemplate rather than because the best choice is what we want. I became a police officer because my best friend, and roommate at university, was ritually raped and murdered. Most of us knew who had done it, but one of the suspects was a campus security guard and his father was the dean. They were also from beyond the veil. I dropped my degree in architecture to take up police work, with the intent that I would never be powerless against those type of people again. You can try to be a dancer, but you could be so much more. As a Strange, you are in a position to reduce suffering and keep your friends safe. The reality is things will come for you, regardless of whether you are prepared for them or not. Fighting back will keep you alive to dance and keep your friends alive too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't have time to argue you into this. I need your help to keep people from dying. If you can't be bothered, fine, walk out, but I won't help you in the future, even if I could."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I..." I thought about leaving until I remembered Marta and the thing ready to feed on her, just because she was there. "What do I have to do?" I asked with resignation in my voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Look these over and sign these forms. They are basic tax reporting, citizenship verification, and salary data. You can look over the benefits forms, talk to HR if they are too confusing, and turn them in by the end of the week." She was right, the forms were amazingly clear for employment papers, but the benefits ones were full of options.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute, is this right, job classification is detective?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. It slows down the territorial pissing when you're at a scene, with officers that aren't from Section 13. Now, the real reason I came and grabbed you is we have more information on your attack. There is only one Belgezyeleth in the city and it is a powerful one, with ten remaining feeders."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, I was going to explain more. Belgezyeleth demons thrive on fear and on control. Control they get by harnessing one or more Yelgezeth sub-demons. These sub-demons feed from living creatures, consuming their fear and draining their life at the same time. They feed the fear to the master and sustain themselves from the bits of life force left over. The Belgezyeleth grows stronger the more the feeders feed it. Status in Belgezyeleth society is based on the number of feeders controlled and the quality of fear extracted. The one in the city is one of the more respected ones. As far as we can tell, the maximum number of feeders a Belgezyeleth can have is twelve, so the one here started with eleven. The relationship is symbiotic so the healthier the master is, the stronger the feeders are. We have killed feeders in the past, from lesser Belgezyeleth, but there has always been a high cost."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You want my help killing the Belgezyeleth?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In the end, yes. Problem is, if you manage to kill the master, it relocates its essence into one of the feeders and regenerates its body. The only way is to kill all the feeders first.  The last four are the hardest. If you try to kill them one at a time, the master jumps back to the demonic realms and recruits more. Sure, it is a social failure in Belgezyeleth society, but the demons are pragmatic enough to deal with it. For now we want to start killing off the excess feeders while we work on a strategy for the last four and the master."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective, oh, sorry, didn't know you were with someone." A slight, stooped man skidded to a halt in the doorway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok, Rick. This is Shan, our new Strange. What do you need?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tracking has lost the Yelgezeth. It dropped completely out of sight, no trace, no shadow-echo, nothing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where was it last detected? Maybe Shan can pick up a trace."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Near Murllan's Pub at the corner of Lafayette and S Elliot Pl."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks, we're on our way. Any regular patrols in the area?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, there were no incidents, just the trackers snagged a signal. It didn't last long enough to know what might have been happening." Detective Bishop was already moving as Rick finished.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the car she said, "There are a few things you really should do for that badge. I don't think you need to go through the entire police academy program, but there are courses you should take. It will help with your cover and make you safer when interacting with officers from other precincts. I would really recommend unarmed combat training as well. Martin Esterhaaz, of the Tiger Dojo, has a good reputation and he is an Awakened. The academy courses are for those without your skills. Work on your magic as well. It has saved you once already."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do I go through the academy courses?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I send a request and they slide you into the next class with an opening." She stopped as we pulled up to the bar. It was a small corner bar that had been kept close to its original look, although the huge display screens showing sports ruined the ambiance. Even in the middle of the day it was crowded. I looked around, but nothing leapt out at me. Detective Bishop eyed up the place, then headed to the bar. I trailed along, not quite sure how to act. She settled on an empty bar stool, motioned for me to join her, and ordered two sodas. We sat and listened to the conversations around us, finished our drinks, and left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Maybe a hint of something near the door, but not enough to do anything with. What now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The boring part of police work, reports and research through other sightings. Would you like me to drop you at the school or somewhere else?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At the school. I need to get in some practice time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tharsday afternoon detective Bishop showed up again and dragged me to a seedy, run down laundromat, Bridge Laundry, in the shadow of the Hattmanan Bridge. It was dirty, the equipment rusty, but it was half full of patrons and most of the equipment was in use. We turned right, went down a short flight of stairs into another area, and walked to the back. A nerdy looking girl was sitting behind a desk, typing on a large laptop. She was in black jeans, a white T-shirt, with the "Conflict for Mars" game logo on the front. "Leia, you have a minute?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She held up a finger and continued typing for another few seconds, then said, "Sure Nikki, what's up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anybody talking about the attacks in the bridge park last night?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean the puppet people hit? No, and that's surprising. We don't often see Gladius hits in this part of town."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think it was Gladius Dei. The coroner's report said fighting claws, which isn't their style."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You, new girl, you aren't Gladius Dei, are you? I know their type have infiltrated the police at every level." My look of complete confusion must have reassured her, because she continued, "Don't listen to Nikki. She doesn't want to understand how dangerous the Gladius groupies are. That's why I keep things running in here, even if there aren't many patrons some hours. The noise masks their surveillance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not everything is Gladius Dei, Leia. What do the rumors say?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Someone said it was a black thing of claws and terror, but he reeked so much of wine that I wasn't sure. So, who's the new girl?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Leia Cassini, this is Detective Shan Mason."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Mason, good to meet you. Nikki, be very sure to tell her about Gladius Dei."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come on, Leia, you know they're mostly urban myth. The real Gladius Dei was disbanded years ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Mason, come back sometime and I'll tell you about them. Nikki doesn't want to believe Gladius remains active."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could we get back to the attack? Was that all you heard?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The woman that found him said he was torn up very badly. The responding officers looked bad after seeing the scene. It must have been intended to send a message rather than just a removal hit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok Leia, thanks for your help. We need to go, other cases to look into."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Mason, I'm here most days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, thanks." I waited until we were back in the car before asking, "What was that all about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Leia is a conspiracy nut and a civilian. She sees Gladius Dei everywhere, but she listens to all the rumors because they feed into her obsession. Her information is useful once you learn to filter out the paranoia. I think the attack was another Yelgezeth one from what she said."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, what is Gladius Dei?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was a covert enforcement arm of the Cothloc religion. They answered directly to the Heirophancy and were often the Heirophant's hit squad. They were disbanded in the 1940's after a particularly spectacular series of events they were at the center of. Every so often a church official will use their name as a scare tactic, threatening to have the Heirophant start them up again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds creepy! Should we look at the scene?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, all the impression evidence will be gone after everyone tromped through the area. Back to the school today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was sitting at my desk, staring blankly at a textbook, when Marta came in. "Hey Shan, want to grab dinner?" I was a bit surprised. She hadn't asked since our first couple of weeks, once our schedules filled up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, cafeteria?" She nodded and we headed down to the third floor. We ate in silence, another oddity, since Marta was usually animated and talkative.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She didn't really look at me as she asked, "Shan, what's going on with you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The extremely driven Shan Mason has cut classes two days in a row. Both times the police have dropped you off. What's going on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are more things out there like what attacked us. The police want my help finding them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta stared at me as she finished her meal. "Let's find an empty practice room. I'd like to run some lines." I looked at her in confusion for a second, before I caught up with her meaning, and nodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We started the hunt on our floor, the sixteenth floor, but ended up on the top floor before we found an empty one. Marta started in as soon as the door swung closed. "And why is a police hunt your job? There's more to this than you are telling, isn't there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Bishop is pulling on me because of what I did to save us and because I'm something called a Strange Attractor. I don't even know what that is. It's hard to refuse a request when I can supposedly save lives, but it interferes with my goals here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean, 'and'?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As a child, I saw ghosts, other worldly creatures, and other strange things, but never anyone using magic. My village talked about spirits and rituals, but no one ever dared try any of them. Then you come along and save our lives with magic. Where did you learn? What's it like? Can it be taught?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. Terror and pain triggered it. I don't know if I could manage it again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could. You are different than the rest of us." I couldn't stop the harsh laugh that bubbled up at her words. "You are. You move through Davisson like you own it. Every class, every critique terrifies me. Why do you think I trailed you everywhere those first days? I feel like an imposter here. I come out of critiques shaking and sick, you come out of them without a care in the world. How do you do that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We had to be exceptional to be accepted here. I remind myself of that when things get rough."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's more than that. You are an old soul, far older than you look."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's a laugh. I spent my life dancing, playing video games, and desperately trying to keep my grades up so I could come here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She shook her head and said, "Ok, I understand you don't want to talk about it. Just know that I will listen if you ever do." She rose and started for the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Marta, wait. Look, I feel like I'm going crazy with this stuff. I don't have any answers to your questions. I've seen my share of simulated blood and gore in movies and the regular amounts of ass-hattery in the news, but no more than anyone else. I can't think of anything that could explain what you see."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Freyday morning came the conversation I had been dreading. I walked into the school and Ms. Korikova was waiting. "Mason, my office, now." She turned, fully expecting I would follow. She started as soon as I had closed the office door. "What is going on with you? You could be one of the greats. You have the raw skill, the drive to learn, and, until this thing with the police, the focus. If you want to be a great dancer, you need to let go of the police thing and focus on dance again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have a chance to find out who attacked us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is in the past. Let it stay there. Worry more about your future."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her words stayed with me all day, banging around against all the other strange things of the week. I made it through my classes, but my rhythm was off, my dancing stiff, and I couldn't focus at all in the lecture classes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I called Marta and left a message as soon as the last class was over, telling her I would be staying at a friend's so the dorm mates wouldn't worry.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The subway ride was hard, trying to stay calm among all the strangers. I stepped into the private areas of the Arakov home, intending to let Mrs. Arakov know I was there. My words died in my throat as I saw her. It was the first time since I had changed and I saw she wasn't human either. She was taller than she usually appeared, her skin glowing a faint luminescent green. Her hair was ebony, with greenish hilights and it floated and drifted as if in a gentle wind, even though the air in the house was still.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, dear?" Mrs. Arakov asked after I had remained silent for some time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, uh, is it ok if I crash in Talia's room until she gets home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. You should know by now that you don't need to ask."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hurried up the stairs to the top floor, through the common areas, and into Talia's room at the back of the building. Many would think it belonged to a thirteen year old boy with all the science fiction and game posters plastered on the walls. Her gaming console, gaming computer, and large monitor filled her desk. The only non-fan-boy items in the room were her stuffed tiger on the bed and some of the clothes in her closet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I dropped my bag on the floor, kicked off my shoes, yanked the fake bandages off my face and side, and curled up on the bed, clutching the stuffed tiger. The tears I had been holding back trickled out in a steady stream. They never hit the sobbing in agony stage, but they ran constantly until I drifted into an uneasy sleep some time later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia sitting down on the bed woke me. "Shan, are you alright?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her question brought the tears again. "Not really, no," I replied in a choked voice. "I'm lying to everyone, except you and Detective Bishop, about the police and everything else. I can't stand it anymore."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What involvement with the police? I thought you were hunting your attacker." I sat up slowly, stood, picked up my bag, and sat down next to her. After a long hesitation I opened the bag and tossed the detective badge between us, never once looking at her. She picked it up, stared at it, and asked, "Is this real?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah. Detective Bishop has been pulling me out of classes for the last few days. The first time she sprang that on me. She says it will help with the Strange stuff, give me credibility with the other officers, some shit like that. But it doesn't come for free. I'm supposed to attend Police Academy courses and be available whenever there's an incident where my Strange powers could be of use. I've already been on a couple of calls. And I'm lying to myself that I can still be a dancer. That's the worst of it. I can't be one, not the way I planned, not with this hanging over me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you ever have a second plan, if something happened and you couldn't dance?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I was sure I would dance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did you think when you were on the police calls?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. Part of me was mortified. I don't really like or trust cops. Part of me was thrilled with the hunting aspect of what we did."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe you could become the best Strange you can be. What do you think of that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I read somewhere if you hunt monsters you risk becoming one yourself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's what your friends are for, to keep you from becoming too much of a monster. Trust us to help you with that." She stared at me for a couple of minutes. I could see something in her eyes, but I wasn't sure what until she said, "My friend the monster hunter, that is so awesome!" then she leaned in and kissed me. I froze, shocked, surprised, and after a moment's thought, more than a little turned on. Talia recoiled when I froze and started babbling, "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I know you..." I grabbed her head, pulled her close, and kissed her back. "Oh wow!" she said in a breathy voice when we came up for air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We stared at each other for a few moments, then burst into giggles. She reached out her hand and gently traced the scars on my face. There were three almost parallel, slightly jagged, white lines running from just above my right eye down to the line of my jaw. "I know you won't agree, but I'm afraid I find your scars very hot. Show me the others." I pulled up my top and let her run her fingers over the slashes in my side, where the thing had stabbed me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia put her hands over mine, where they were holding up the top, and helped me pull it over my head and off. Her mouth sought mine like a hungry predator. I responded in kind and soon the rest of our clothes flew off. I didn't know what I was doing, but Talia obviously had some experience. I followed her lead and did the things I liked to her. Hours later we collapsed on the bed, wrapped in each other's arms, and slowly drifted to sleep. I woke much later, desperately needing to pee. When I came back to bed, I thought I would be freaked out or uncomfortable with what had happened. All I felt was an incredible warm glow looking at Talia sleeping. I slid in close and settled back to sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My phone woke me at three in the morning. My startled "What the fuck?" woke Talia as I was digging for it. I answered it just before it would have gone to voice mail.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Mason, I need you at a crime scene," Detective Bishop's voice came from the phone. "I'll send a cruiser for you once you tell me where you are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm at a friend's place. I'll be outside the Arakov Market, in the Village, in about ten minutes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A cruiser will be waiting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is what I'm afraid of," I said to a sleepy Talia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She pulled my head down and kissed me with promise. "Go be the monster hunter. Come back to me if it isn't too late. Here, take my keys in case you need to get back in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I dressed, kissed her, and hurried down the stairs. A police cruiser was pulling up just as I reached the street. "Detective Mason?" I nodded as I slid in to the passenger seat. We were moving before I had my belt fastened. There was something exciting about hurrying to a crime scene in a cruiser with the lights and sirens going.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We rolled up to the south entrance of my building. I looked at the officer next to me, "Is this it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, detective. There was a homicide in the north east corner of the eleventh floor, a Mr. and Ms. Fredderson." She pulled up to the curb, stopped the cruiser, and motioned me out. Detective Bishop was waiting at the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come with me." She led the way into the building, flashing her badge at James, the doorman. "Detective Mason is with me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ms. Mason?" James raised his eyebrows as I followed her into the building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Morning James. I know it's strange. I'll try and explain later," I said as I hurried after her to the elevators.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We stepped out on the eleventh floor, turned left, then took the next right after that. There was a clot of people standing near the door to 11109, including my dad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shan, what are you doing here?" he asked as we walked up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's with us, Mr. Mason. Detective, if you please," Detective Bishop replied as she waved me past the police watching the door. "I hadn't realized you were part of the Mason family owning The Elizabeta."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It shouldn't embarrass me, but it does. I guess it's because I feel odd being from a wealthy family," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't seem the worse for it," she said as we went down the short entry hall, to the dining room on the right. The visuals beyond the door were a little startling, but only because they were real, not set dressing. I almost lost it at the smell, though. That was something the crime dramas rarely showed, the gut punch the stink of old blood, shit, body fluids, and the beginnings of putrefaction would cause. I had to retreat to the hallway for several breaths before I could cope. With the breaths came the cold detachment that helped me in Conflict for Mars.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It had been a violent killing. The couple had been shredded and tossed around the dining room. The coroner was just packing up the largest pieces, from on top of the table, when we entered. The crime scene unit was in place, collecting evidence. I noticed right away they weren't as thorough or meticulous as the crime shows would indicate. There was more raw banter as well, stuff no producer would dare to put in a show.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a time I just watched the various people going about their tasks, idly looking around the room, until a small hint of Awakened energy from the door caught my attention. Nothing looked out of the ordinary until I turned off the colorizer spells in my earrings. Then it leapt into focus. "It portaled into the dining room doorway and made its way across the entry hall to the master bedroom, where it found its targets."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hadn't realized I was muttering out loud until Detective Bishop said, "What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I jerked her way, startled, "Was I talking?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, please, continue."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, ok. It came in through the dining room door," I was looking at the veil energies in little spots throughout the scene. "It knew where to look for the targets. It didn't wander, just went straight across to the bedroom." I stepped carefully around the blood and pieces to get there. "It pulled her out first. Somehow they were immobilized, so they couldn't struggle." Some weird thing clicked over in my brain and I could taste the residual energies. "Magic. It subdued them with a spell of some kind. Then it took her first, ripping her apart and eating, eating what? Whoa," I muttered, too low for anyone else to hear, as images overlaid themselves over the scene as I described it, fading into full color and detail. It played out in real time then, the entire ghastly affair, thankfully without sound or smell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Phil," Detective Bishop called. "Are there any obvious missing pieces of the bodies?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The coroner stopped at the door and turned, "Yes, the pancreas was missing from both torsos. How did you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ask Detective Mason. She caught it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lucky guess," I called to him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bullshit," he said, without rancor. "You're the new spook, aren't you? Even if you're young."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, Phil, team, this is Detective Shan Mason, the new Strange Attractor for our fair city. I expect you to teach her the ropes and treat her with respect," Detective Bishop answered. "Detective, what else do you have?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It brought the woman out first. Then the man. It ate them at its leisure, taking its time with the dismemberment, nibbling at the most tender muscles before the desert of pancreas. Once it finished, it portaled out from the dining table." I walked out of the dining room, turned left, and went to stand at the living room window. I stared down onto Broadway at night, without really seeing it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Detective Bishop came over a few minutes later. "You did quite well. I wasn't sure you'd be able to take it. And that trick of figuring out what happened, our old Strange couldn't have pulled that off." She looked at me carefully for a few seconds, "Have you seen this kind of thing before? Most people get really sick the first few times."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's no more graphic than some of the things my mom and I watch, or a bloody cut-scene in a game. I just pretended I was watching an episode of a crime drama. Well, a crime drama with sense-u-smell added. I always suspected it would smell terrible. Do you ever get used to it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You always notice it, but, with time, you learn to quickly ignore it. Fortunately, the truth isn't as bad as fiction makes it sound. It does get into your clothes, but laundering usually gets it out. It washes off skin and hair with a good shower as well. I'd recommend keeping a spare set of clothes at the precinct so you have something else to change into. Would you recognize the killer from the 'video'?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, do you have a sheet of critter types to look at? It was a Veil Event, the killer wasn't human at all. Kind of a biped with a frog-like mouth and lots of sharp teeth. Hands with two fingers and a thumb, with the smaller two fingers replaced with some type of horn or bone blade. That's what it used for the slicing and dicing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Mason, there's something you might want to see over here," one of the techs called from the kitchen door. She was tall, maybe an inch or two taller than me, with a similar, dancer build. Her dark wavy hair reached to her mid back and was braided in an elaborate style. Her face showed Ruskala heritage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I followed her to the kitchen, located to the left of the entry door, and looked where she pointed. In front of the fridge was a burn mark, shaped like the point of a triangle, extending from under the fridge. "Can we move this?" I asked, pointing at the fridge.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need to process this first, then we can move it. I'm Nadjah Polina, lead forensics for Section 13, by the way." She took several photos, dusted the fridge for prints, lifting every one before replying, "Ready." We pulled the fridge out and to the side. Under it was a five pointed star pattern burned into the tile. A circle of symbols was burned in the center of the star. Inside the circle was a broken floor safe. Nadjah took several more photos, carefully dusted for prints and lifted all the ones she found, then lifted the safe door with a long tool. The safe was empty.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I unfocused and reached out again. Time was hard to determine, but shortly after the killings another being had portaled into the apartment, directly at the entrance to the kitchen. This one was a man in an old coat and shabby clothes who was certain of his destination. He went directly to the fridge, pushed it out of the way, dropped a pebble into the center of the exposed floor, and waited while a flash fire burned itself out, searing the pattern of the protection into place. A short wand shattered the lock and he extracted a small teak box from inside. He left as soon as he was done. I had seen his face before, somewhere, in entirely different circumstances. "Paper," I said to Nadjah. She handed me a pad and I noted down what I had seen, then said, "Help me look around. There should be a small stone nearby."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She found it, where it had rolled up against a cabinet. It was charred and blackened, but we could make out partial symbols carefully etched into it. It didn't show anything with the colorizer off. We bagged and tagged it and I returned to the main room to tell Detective Bishop what we found. "You see anything else?" she asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I walked the apartment one more time, opening up to everything I could. "No. I think I've found everything I can," I replied when I was done.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok. Next time you come in I'll show you the scene reports you should fill out, instead of notes on a pad. For tonight, this is fine. I can get you back to the precinct, or to another place you'd want to go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My phone showed it was five thirty in the morning. "Back to Arakov Market, where I was picked up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My dad was still in the hall when I left. "Shan, what's going on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't comment on an open investigation," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I meant, what are you doing with the police? Why are you here? Why are they calling you detective?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a long story. Could we talk later today? I'm exhausted and I can explain better when I've gotten sleep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He wanted to press the point, but, at the last minute, he just nodded and said, "Ok, but I'm holding you to this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">I let myself back in and headed up to Talia's room, slipped in, and stared at her sitting in front of her computer. Flickering light from the monitor reflected off her perfect little horns and white hair. She was dressed in a large T-shirt and a headset with microphone clamped over her ears. She was talking softly into the headset. "Testing complete at the air purifiers. I no longer fall through the wall at twenty seven by four-fifty. Oh, gotta go afk for a bit." She clicked a button on a small controller, pulled off the headset, and turned to me. "Hey, what was it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A murder scene."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No wonder I can smell you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, yeah, could I borrow some clothes and the shower?" I replied as I skinned out of my clothes. She motioned for me to come closer. I crossed to her, expecting her to wrinkle her nose at the whiff of death coming off me. She just smiled. I slid up to her, bent down and kissed her. On my way up I nipped at the base of one of her horns. A move I had learned immediately turns her on. Then I whispered in her ear, "One of us is over-dressed," before returning to nip at her horns.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stood up, using the motion to strip off her shirt, then shoved me back on the bed, leaping on top of me. Just before her mouth clamped onto one of my nipples she hissed, "Shower later, sex now!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Much later she said, "I don't mind the smell. Now, tell me what it was like." I hesitated a very long time, prompting her to say, "I am good with secrets and won't talk about an active investigation. You tell me and I'll tell you a secret."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok," I replied and launched into a description of my night. "And now I have to figure out what to tell my dad. I'm not sure he wants to know about the Veil and what it means."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Go with simple? That you are helping because you want to find what, er, who, attacked you. Other than that, what did you think of your first scene?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was a lot more interesting than I expected. Boring too, at times, but good overall."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Suitable to a monster hunter, such as yourself?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If I can figure out how to actually hunt them, yes. Your turn to show me yours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We already did that. The secret? You've seen the notice in Conflict for Mars about the Martian Oracles, the players helping players group?" I nodded, having thought about signing up until I thought about the time commitment. "I am the Oracle Priestess, the head of the group, answering only to the CyCore Games Community Support Manager. That's what I was doing when you came in, testing a new area."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, that is really awesome! But you didn't need to stay up for me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It felt right from a solidarity point of view. Besides, I was just a tiny bit worried and very curious. I've never known a police detective before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure you do now. I'm mostly faking it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh-huh, didn't sound like it to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We talked a bit more and drifted to sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was ten in the morning when we woke up again. The sounds of the rest of the Arakov clan drifted up the stairs, along with the smells of bacon and french toast. "Here, borrow these, so you don't wear the clothes from last night." Talia tossed me a pair of camo pants and a Brain Eater Deluxe band shirt. They were a bit large on me. She had more curves than I did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We went down stairs holding hands, letting go just before entering the communal dining room on the second floor. The Arakov clan had several family groups living in the four floors above the market. Each family had a section of their own, and then there was a communal kitchen, dining room, and a large room for lounging or watching movies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia's mom looked up as we walked in, "It's about time you were fucking, or should that be about fucking time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mom!" Talia said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, it is. You two have been circling each other since middle school. It's good to see you together."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I sat down, face burning, next to Talia as food was passed around. Meals at the Arakov place were rowdy, chaotic, and full of talk, teasing, and good natured squabbling. Sometimes I wondered what it would have been like to grow up in such an extended family, instead of being the only child of very well to do parents.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>


<p class="regtxt5">I slipped into my family's apartment just before four. "Is that you Detective Mason?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yes, dad," I answered. I walked slowly into the dining area and stopped at the door. They were both watching me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am very curious why our daughter was at a murder scene and why was everyone calling you detective. Something has changed you. You sign on with the cops, a group little better than jack-booted thugs. Didn't we teach you anything? What happened to violence never solves anything?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I never understood that. Maybe in the context of world events, but what if I'm in danger of rape, or a friend is in danger of death? Shouldn't I fight back then? Should I just roll over and let the nastiness occur?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, uh, I, no, of course you should defend yourself," dad stammered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's what I am trying to do, defend you and the others. Detective Bishop asked me to help find my attacker. She seems to think I might have some knowledge about it, him, that the police don't. I tried to tell her that I didn't, but she believes I can help save someone else from attack. I couldn't think of a way to say no and still feel right about myself. The badge is to keep the other cops from questioning my presence." I could see my mom wanting to ask more questions, but she held her tongue for some reason.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you heal so quickly?" he asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good medical care."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, I'm glad you are better. I understand you couldn't say no, just be very careful. Most people feel about the police the way you do, or worse. We worry about you and don't want you hurt." I could see the shutters closing, even though my answers didn't make much sense. In a few moments he was back to dad, without any worries about me. I had seen him react this way before, during the museum murders, when my mom thought there was more going on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like to drop my stuff before we eat," I said. My dad just nodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My mom followed me to my room, just as I expected. She barely waited until the door was closed before she started with, "Kilashandra Lakshmi Mason, what is really going on? And don't give me those non-answers you gave your father." She paused just long enough that I was going to say something, then started again, "I've been a consultant. The police wouldn't give you official ID as a consultant. They only do that for actual officers. Your Detective Bishop was the officer in charge for the museum murders all those years ago and they were bad. I never believed the official story. I think it was shadow creatures that did it. And people don't heal as fast as you did, great medical care or not. The only things that can heal like that are the shadow beings. Oh, my god, that's it isn't it? You are one of them. I knew we should have researched you better."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come on mom, shadow people, really?" I grabbed her hand, led us to the bed, and sat down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, really. I have seen things at the museum. I won't bore you with the entire list of strange languages and historical anomalies, just the most notable, recent one. Chani Kordetova found the intact tomb of Tyan Hanan, a Tuar't'zani Queen. Not only was she queen, a rare enough occurrence, but she was also lame. She came on the scene in 320 BC, taking the scattered Tuar tribes and welding them into the Tuar't'zani Trading Empire that lasted until very recently. As primary funding agency, and home to a world renown forensic anthropology department, we were given the task of authenticating the find. Almost everything found dated to the correct time. The anomaly was the queen herself. She was in amazing health, with an odd mineral composition in her bones. Minerals that made no sense given where she was and the time in which she lived. She was lame, we could tell from the way the skeleton was worn. She hadn't been in a fall and it wasn't from a birth defect. It was caused by a piece of metal alloy broken off in her lower spine, similar to a car or aircraft accident. Nothing of the time could produce the metal, which is similar to aircraft aluminum or titanium, but not the same. Legends say she communed with the gods, then fell back to earth to raise the Tuar up. Tell me I'm crazy, but I don't think she was from here originally."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was a perfect opening, but I couldn't do it. Instead I said, "Are you sure you want to know?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your illness changed you. You used to be afraid of the dark. I'd have to carry you to the bathroom, turning on all the lights as we went. Then you would do the same when you could go on your own. Now you walk through the apartment without turning on a single light and your eyes glow a strange silver in the dark. Please, tell me what is going on."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you certain you want to know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She started to say yes, but paused at something in my eyes, face, or voice, and said, "Why do you ask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Once the veil is torn, you can't stitch it back up and pretend you don't know. I have seen things I wish I hadn't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean the Freddersons murder?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, that was ugly, but expected at a murder scene and after watching too many crime dramas. No, other things, terrible things from the shadows, like what attacked Marta and I. So I ask one last time, are you sure you want to know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She took a deep breath and answered, "Yes, I want to know." I told her everything. She sat silently until I finished, then asked, "Will I see what you see with your silver eyes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I don't know if anyone knows for certain. I hope you won't, not all of it anyway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you thought about what you are going to do, about the police thing, about school, about your dancing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've only started to. Seems I'm another reluctant hero, just like in all the stories."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you reluctant, or just grieving for what the change means? Any great change is a loss of the old, even if the new is sought after. It produces a period of grief and adjustment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hadn't thought of it that way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It helps, trust me, I've been there a few times. We will support whatever decisions you make. We love you and want you to be happy. Just be careful. And know you can always come to me to talk things out." She pulled me into a long hug. I realized how much I had missed these heart-to-heart talks with her. They had been getting farther and farther apart over the years and had stopped after the illness. "If you decide to be part of the police, I will accept it, but I'll worry about you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know yet. Seeing people I know dead wasn't good, but if I can help track down who did it, catching them will be very satisfying."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stopped at the door and turned back, "Can I ask you something, something a bit odd?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you heard of something called Gladius Dei?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've heard the name, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The museum gets a lot of mail from crazies, most of it virulent, but harmless. There are a few that seem very serious, usually coming in clusters, and ranting from a dangerously fanatical religious point of view. Some of them have the symbology of the Gladius Dei. However, Gladius Dei was disbanded years ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What were they?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Historically, they were the personal force of the Cothloc Heirophant. They ran the inquisitions, the purges, and most of the other terrible things the Cothlocs did. We did an exhibit on them ten years ago. The hate mail around it was especially terrifying."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you notified the police?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shar, the director, says the threats aren't serious."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you think they are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something about them worries me. I found out later that we had seen similar threats before the museum murders."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know someone I can ask. I'll let you know if I find anything out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I left for Leia's place early the next morning. At school I would hear recent arrivals complaining about getting around Yew Nork, but with the transit authority web trip planner and accurate time, it was always simple to get just about anywhere. It took me under an hour to get to the laundromat, far less time than driving and fighting traffic ever would.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia was in the same chair, at the back of the place, still typing on her computer. I could tell she had moved because her top was a Shadow Journeys shirt, showing the Forever City, this time. "Detective Mason, didn't expect to see you so soon."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You caught my interest the other day. I would like to know more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok then, let's talk in a slightly better place," she replied as she closed her laptop, unplugged the power supply, and headed to a small door behind the table. It opened into a tiny room, with a narrow bed, hot plate, and mini fridge. She pulled out her phone, selected an app, and pointed it around the room, then ran it up and down the air around me. "Clean."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She walked to the back of the narrow room and pressed a series of bricks in the wall. A section swung in, revealing a steep stairway leading up. I followed her to the top where they opened into a good sized studio apartment. It was spartan, but spotless. Talia motioned me to the only chair while she sat on her narrow bed. The chair was worn, covered in a thick lion print blanket, and extremely comfortable. Sunlight filtered in through the windows, which overlooked a kind of courtyard inside the surrounding building. "We can talk here. I sweep daily, so no one can overhear us. What did you want to know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"More about Gladius Dei, but I don't know where you should start."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Like I started to say the other day, Gladius started as the right hand special enforcer squad for the Heirophancy. It officially started in 1160, answered only to the Heirophant, and was officially disbanded in the early 1920s, after a nasty, and very public, event called attention to them. Problem is, they still exist. I have memos, electronic communication, and sightings to verify all this. Nikki doesn't want to believe me because it scares her where these people might be. I know for a fact that YNPD is completely infiltrated by these guys. So are most of the other city administration offices."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is there any way to identify them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sometimes. A few have either a cross or a hand holding a sword tattoo behind an ear or at the base of the hair line. It's not a certainty, though. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My mom thinks they have been threatening people at the Natural History Museum. Do you know what they want?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean besides power, control, and wealth?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess there wouldn't have to be more, but is there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, this is going to sound a bit crazy, but, there are people in this world who aren't people. They look like people, but they aren't. They came from elsewhere. I don't know if it's an invasion, an evacuation, or if they are just tourists, but they are here. Gladius wants to kill them, after getting as much power from them as they can. They consider the visitors and anything related to them as threats to the stability and power of the Cothloc church, and thus 'demonic'. It is their mission to destroy that threat and anything they consider 'tainted' by it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, yeah, I know, sounds crazy, but it's true. I know where a lot of them hang out. In the West Village, around Washiwa Square and that upscale market. What's it called? What's it called? Oh, yeah, Arachnikov, no, Arakov Market. Anyway, Gladius suspects, but can't figure out how to find them. They want anything old, anything that might have a way to pick out the visitors from the rest of us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tourists? Maybe Nikki was..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've seen them, ok?" she was staring at me all of a sudden. "There's a kind of crackly, shimmery energy around them and if I squint just right, I can see their real form. Just like I can see a shifting pattern of green, gold, and black around you." She leaned back fast, grabbed an ugly pistol from between the bed and the wall, and leveled it at my face. "What are you? Did they send you? Do they know what I am, who I am? Why are you here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hold on a minute. No one sent me. You asked me here, remember?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That was before, before I saw you were one of them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How can you see? Are you one of them too?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The gun wavered a bit as she seemed to think about it. "You aren't the same. What are you? I'm not one, I know who my parents are and where they came from. Your energy is different, stronger and more focused."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am a Strange Attractor, and before you ask, I don't know very much about what that means."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Strange Attractor, Strange, Attractor, yeah, I guess I could see that. A lot has been written about your kind. Most of it rumor, since none of you ever grant interviews. You die young, are attracted to the worst dangers, and end up fighting for your lives most days. Gladius would like to possess you, or be able to control you, in their quest for domination. No one knows why the most vile things through the Gates seek you out, but they will. I think it's because they know you will find them and get rid of them. At least I know you aren't Gladius," she ended as she set the gun back in the drawer. "I've never met a Strange before. Do you know if all of you have the same type of aura?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't even know I had one until now. What do you mean 'all of you'? How many are there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's said there are enough of you to cover all the Gates. Thing is, no one is saying how many Gates there really are. Maybe no one knows for certain. What do you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Less than you. Do you know of any way to reliably determine Gladius members? I think there are spies in Section 13. Every time we try and track things, they know we're coming before we get to them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it's not as simple as identifying visitors. Gladius auras are like everyone's, all over the place. I know who some are, but only because of digging. Archpriest Dolas of the Cothlocs is one. The Deputy Commissioner of Police is another. The Commissioner is not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should head back. I'd like to talk again, sometime."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That would be good. I'd love to know more about Stranges as you figure it out," she paused, then said, "Look, I love Nikki like a sister, but don't trust all the police you meet. She's a rare gem in a sea of shit. Keep your eyes open and pay attention to everything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Honey, is that you?" my mom asked when I returned home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, mom." I found her in the kitchen, staring at a cooking video and following along. "I found out a little bit about Gladius, none of it good. They target things related to the veil, considering it abomination, and wanting to destroy or hide it. I don't want to alarm you, but be careful and talk to Shar about the threats. She might want to take them a bit more seriously."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll try. How serious do you think this is?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I'm too new to this to have any idea."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thoughts and plans bounced around in my head all weekend, but nothing came of it. Monday found me changing for Ms. Korikova's class, just after arriving at school. Something had my nerves on edge, but it wasn't the discussions of the weekend. It grew as I entered the room and started warming up. As Ms. Korikova entered, it peaked in half seen images, drifting just out of the corner of my eye. I spun to see, but only staggered away from the barre. I recovered, but another image shimmered, almost clear this time. I stumbled and fell clumsily into the barre. Ms. Korikova was walking toward me when a clear image of a third floor practice room snapped into place. A dark shadow attacked the woman seated at the piano.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mason," Ms. Korikova began as I sprinted from the room, sliding in the hall on my point shoes, but recovering and dashing for the stairs. She ran after me, trying to get my attention. I ignored her, pushing myself harder as I pounded up the stairs. On the third floor, I skidded to a halt, waiting for a clue to which way. It came in a roiling wave of terror. I spun and ran down the hall to the left, slamming through the door and into the room where a dark figure reached toward a frozen woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey," I yelled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It spun and twisted its features into a gruesome look. "I know you," it said as the woman slid to the floor and toppled to the side. Her face was grey and strained, her mouth open in a silent scream. It sprang and I barely dodged its grasp. It spun and slashed again. This time it connected, ripping a shallow gash across my stomach. I spun and tried to strike. It dodged easily and cackled. "I will have you for what you have done." It slashed again, this time driving through the new scars and into my guts. I staggered back, crashing heavily on the piano bench, and sliding to the floor. It came at me, raised its claws, and prepared to strike again. It whirled when Ms. Korikova kicked it in the back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It dove at her and I dove at it, trying desperately to remember how to call up the magic. Korikova spun away in a fluid whirl. "Do something, Mason. I can't distract it forever." I hauled myself up, blood running down my side, and leaned into the back of the creature. It started to spin, my mind spun frantically, desperately trying to call up the magic. It swung and I tried to blank my mind. Korikova swung again and it turned again. I sucked a deep breath and tried a last time. The magic erupted just as it slashed at her. A purple burst blasted through it just before it connected. It dissipated and Korikova caught me as I fell, easing me to the floor. She handed me her phone and said, "You had better call you detective friend. We need to get you and the other woman out of here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I fumbled to dial the code to Section 13 and described the event, asking for a veil aware med team to come for cleanup. The blood had slowed by the time the call was finished. "They will be here soon. I need to rest a few minutes," I said and leaned my head back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I vaguely heard her ask me something, then a little later I heard Detective Bishop asking, "Were there any witnesses?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, the door was closed and the sound dampening will have kept the other rooms from hearing," Korikova answered. "You could take both of them out as medical emergencies and say they collapsed from stress. I can keep Mason at my home while she recovers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You've done this before," Bishop said. "Why didn't I know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't here. I can tell you later, right now your presence is causing questions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You heard, get me two gurneys up here and a couple of med-techs." I woke up slightly while they were loading me onto a gurney. It was a bumpy ride to the elevator and out to the ambulance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I woke up once again when they were unloading the other victim at the hospital. Korikova helped me sit up and hobble to Detective Bishop's car. Twenty minutes later we were at her building where she helped me stumble to her apartment, and collapse on her couch. I slid into blackness as soon as I landed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hours later I drifted awake. Korikova was sitting in an easy chair, reading a book, and watching me. "You're a Strange, a dancer, and a police detective. You are a busy woman."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I knew a Strange once, in Moskava Academy of Dance. She was a bit like you, a natural with enough drive for both of us. She wasn't a Strange then, just another dancer. We became best friends and were inseparable, until she got sick. It was a terrible illness, keeping her in hospital for several weeks. When she returned, she was changed. Her focus had shifted, she saw things in the shadows, and she was always running into danger. I pressured her until she told me what was going on. I helped her after that, until she was killed. You need to find a dream that fits with being a Strange. Svetlana never did and I think that's why she died."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My mind was having trouble keeping up with her. I wanted to ask questions, but I couldn't get them to form. "How?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's up to you, but you won't be able to keep your old dreams. Find something that makes you feel good about being a Strange. I'll help if I can. Find friends that you can trust to talk with and to help you. Don't allow yourself to become isolated. You won't survive that. You should rest now, it will help you heal faster. Do you need to call anyone?" I nodded. She handed me my bag, I dug out my phone, called Talia first, then Marta. </p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her apartment was a small one-bedroom at the top of her building. The shape of the roof could be seen in the corners of the room. Dance posters, photographs, and programs were framed and hung on the walls and were set on small shelves. In most of them, Ms. Korikova was the principal. "How is the other person?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In a place called Trauma 3. No word yet, but still alive thanks to you. You should rest more, if you are anything like Lana. I'll get food while you do," she said as she helped me to her bedroom, in a dormer facing West Broadway. It was tiny, with just enough room for a small bed, a table, flat screen monitor, and the media player to feed it. A framed photo rested on the table next to the bed, with two young dancers in it. She saw my look, blushed a tiny bit, then said, "Yes, the two of us, shortly before Lana died." There were no other photos that weren't dance related. "Can you get out of your clothes or do you need help?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I started to bend to reach the snaps of my leotard, but the pain from the slashes stopped me. "I need help," I replied, face flaming. She helped without a word and soon she was placing my ruined dance clothes into a plastic bag.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tried to stay awake and form questions, but my body had other ideas. When I woke again it was to the smell of hot food. The light from the window showed it to be after dark, hours after I collapsed. "Ah, you are awake! I have piroshki, hot borscht and bread from the Baba Iaga Ruskala deli downstairs. My family owns it. Have as much as you like." She helped me into a robe and then to her small table. I piled the wonderful tasting food in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You need to learn your magic. If you could have blasted that thing immediately, instead of later, you wouldn't have been hurt."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, but I didn't believe in magic when I came to this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is hard to adapt. The faster you can, though, the more likely you are to live. Remember this as you do. Many stories call magic black or white. This is not the truth. Magic is like electricity, a force, something without intent. It is the intent and actions of the wielder that determines the tone of the magic that is used. Although, letting the unawakened believe there is a high cost to magic keeps them from trying it themselves. So it is a useful fiction." We talked late into the night as I tried to sort out what was happening and she told me stories of things she had seen. She pushed me down onto the couch when my eyes began to droop. "We can talk more later. Now you need sleep." I was going to object, but I fell asleep mid-thought.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I woke with the dawn, mostly healed and feeling quite a bit better. I was up and fumbling in my bag when she emerged from her room. "What are you doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dressing for school."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not today," she held up her hand, "I know you think you can, and in emergencies, you could. When there isn't an emergency, you should learn to take time for yourself. You will be better after a full day of resting. There's a network connection, wired, with a jack near the table. I'll excuse you for today. I want you to rest and think about everything that has changed in your life. I don't expect you to tell me what you decide, unless you want to, but you do need to seriously think about it. There are a few leftovers in the fridge and energy bars in the cupboard. I will tell my family that you can eat on my account on my way out. We can settle up later. Oh, and you can leave the door unlocked if you are just going to the deli."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When she was gone, I took a quick shower, to wash the last of the blood off, then ate the last of the leftovers. My mind skittered away from her request, so I walked around the tiny apartment, looking at what was there, and what wasn't. Except for the single picture of Ms. Korikova with Svetlana, there were only dance items. It was a sobering thought and it brought my mind back to her task. My life had been simple, I was going to study dance, join a troupe, and work up to principle dancer. Once I was too old to dance, I would retire and become a choreographer. The Arakov enclave was such a different world from what I saw around me. It seethed with interactions and connections, where this was lonely and almost sterile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Three options seemed likely. The solitude of Ms. Korikova's life. The quiet, slightly distant life of my parents, where they went out with friends, but rarely had anyone to our place. Or the chaos of the Arakov family, where people came and went and extended families formed from traditional relationships and deep friendships. I had taken a step toward the second or third option by embracing Talia, but it could easily turn into Ms.Korikova all over again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I settled into her chair and let the last months echo in my mind. I drifted in and out of light sleep, seeing some of the events in nightmares, dreams, and half waking thoughts. Slowly it became clear which path I wanted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When I came fully awake, it was early afternoon. The smells drifting up from the deli downstairs reminded me of how hungry I was. I slipped my shoes on and descended to the street. The main room was half full of people. A woman looking like an older version of Ms. Korikova was standing behind the deli counter. Four women in colorful Ruskala clothing were hurrying between tables and the kitchen in the back. I slid to the counter and said, "Um, Ms. Korikova said I should..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you Shan? Tasha said you might be down." She waved one of the women over, "Nadya, Shan eats with the family. Shan, this is my oldest, Nadya."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nadya practically dragged me into a back area of the kitchen and sat me at the lone table in a back corner. I had a view of two older men cooking, while a younger man and woman helped. "Ivan, my dad, and Uncle Vasili are cooking, my cousins, Ilya and Elena, are helping. Everyone, this is Shan Mason, a friend of Natasha. What would you like?" Nadya asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh," I started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You eat meat?" Ivan asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then you will like the Chicken Kevia. Welcome to our home! Nadya, we can take care of Ms. Mason. Go help your mom. Elena, Get Ms. Mason a kvass, she's an honored guest. Now, how do you know our Natasha?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I gave them the very short version. "Our Natasha is a wonderful woman, but she allows herself no friends, no family, only her dance. I do not understand how she lives. There was a tragedy in her youth and she has closed herself off ever since. It is a surprise she brought you here. She has not befriended students before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come Vasili, it is her choice," Ivan said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am honored she has shared you with me," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ms. Mason, tell us about yourself. Is there only the dance for you, like our Natasha, or is there more?" Ivan asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please, just call me Shan. Ms.Mason makes me feel like I'm my mom. It was only dance until recently. Several people, including Ms. Korikova, have suggested I consider being more." Vasili was starting to say something when Elena set a drink in front of me. I sipped it warily, not sure what it would be, and found it lightly fizzy, a bit bready, and very tasty.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are like Svetlana, aren't you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Vasili!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. How could I be like her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ivan, I don't mean it in a bad way, but look at her. That same watchfulness, eyes that see more than others, and a coiled spring stillness, as if waiting for something unexpected. Svetlana was a dancer Natasha knew when she was young. They were, better than friends. It did not bother us, her family, but many others were scandalized. Svetlana was involved in something dangerous and she dragged Natasha into it. In the end, the danger got her killed. It was a tragedy and it broke something in our Natasha. She has been alone since."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was considering leaving when Ivan slid a plate in front of me. A golden chicken breast sat nestled in fluffy white rice. Steamed asparagus, green beans, and carrots completed the dish. It smelled wonderful and tasted even better. I settled back, with a sigh of satisfaction and ate slowly, savoring the simple flavors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well?" Ivan asked a few minutes later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Amazing! Thank you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"See Vasili, not exactly like Svetlana. Food was always an after thought for her. We mean no disrespect to you, Shan. It is just so rare for Natasha to bring anyone here, much less let them stay while she is away. It is good, but we want to understand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know either. She is rather frightening at the school. Most of us think she considers us a waste of her time. Today, I think she hides behind it so she doesn't have to face what happened to her friend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You knew?" Vasili asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She told me about Svetlana last night. I might be like her, but I won't be dragging Ms.Korikova into anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe it would be best if you did. It might shake her loose, remind her to live her life instead of hiding from it," Vasili said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Or get her killed," Ivan said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She would be alive again. Is it better to live long, but dead life, or live short and good one?" Vasili countered. It felt like an old argument, worn and comfortable like a favorite night gown.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Help her for us, please. Help her find something to let her live again," Ivan added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will do all I can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, good! Now finish your food. It is best when warm." Once I was finished, Vasili set a second plate in front of me. Two thin pancakes were rolled up with a filling of some kind and a small dish of honey was set next to them. "Crepes, with poppy seed and apple, a house speciality. Please try."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"These are wonderful. My mom tried to make crepes once, but they didn't work out. How do you get them so perfect?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let me show you," Ivan said. He motioned me close and demonstrated how to quickly pour and swirl the batter to get it thin enough, without gaps. "The trick is the batter must be thin enough. Too many try to make it too thick and it won't flow easily enough. Here, you try." I tried to mimic his motions, but didn't come close. I started to step away, but he motioned me back. "Keep trying. It is simple, once you get it." It took a dozen tries, but he was right, once I had done it once, it became simpler. "I will let you have my recipe, if you come and tell me how your family liked them." I nodded and he handed me a stained card from a paper strewn counter. "I can recite from memory."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ivan, we should be setting up for the dinner rush," Vasili interrupted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should be going," I added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You will come see us again?" Ivan asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, of course!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Take this, it is Natasha's favorite. Try and get her to eat all of it," Vasili said as he handed me a plate piled high with cabbage rolls.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll see what I can do. Thank you for your hospitality."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A friend of Natasha's is family. You are always welcome here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slipped out to the street and up to the apartment. I had just settled back on the couch when Ms. Korikova came in. "Cabbage rolls? How did you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Vasili insisted. I like your family."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did they tell you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just that they worry about you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing more?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What else would they tell me, Ms. Korikova?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Natasha, please call me Natasha. As a Strange, you are no longer my student."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then what are we?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would wish you to be a friend. Did they talk of Lana?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would like that. No, they really didn't say anything about Lana. Although, I guess you were more than friends. It does not matter to me. I am the same way and have a woman lover of my own. Is there anything else I should know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"About my family, no. About being a Strange, not really."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"About that, I have given it serious thought. Not sure of all my conclusions yet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is expected. It is a lot to handle. I have been thinking of what I said about magic. You might try your centering ritual for dance when using it. You will need to find something faster than the five slow breaths, but it might be a place to start."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I worked my ass off to get into Davisson and I don't want to leave. This thing feels like it won't give me a choice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's always choice, but I watched Lana try to deny being a Strange and stay at school. It didn't end well. As the head of the ballet section, I don't want you to leave either. You inspire the others and you don't have dancer, mega-bitch ego. As someone who lost a lover to this, I want you to find a path that lets you live."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia called while I was on my way back to the dorm, reminding me about the Hallows Eve party at the Midnight Garden. I still hadn't come up with a good costume idea. I had thought of a Conflict for Mars costume, but hadn't gotten the elaborate fabrics it would require. In desperation, I called Talia back, asking for ideas. We settled on something based on The Forever City starting characters. Typical costumes were a mix of sexy wear and military wear. My mom had fatigues from her time in the army and I had worn out dance wear that could be cut down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I detoured home to grab the fatigues, then back to school. By the end of the evening I had something that would work. Marta came in while I was modeling the finished work. "Hot! Post apocalypse?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I couldn't stop the smile from the compliment. "No, Shadow Journeys Forever City, a video game. I needed a costume for a party tomorrow night."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I didn't miss the flicker of sadness that darted across her face as she said, "Oh."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's an open party at the Midnight Garden in the village. You could come if you want. Costumes are optional, but the door charge is more if you don't have one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like that. It'll be more fun than hanging out here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Midnight Garden was filled with wild and varied costumes. Heavy, pounding beats drifted up from the basement bar and people would slip downstairs, dance for a while, then take a break in the gardens themselves. Night blooming plants and strange sculptures filled the center area of the greenhouse topped back section of the building. A walkway, large enough for a single set of tables, ringed the garden, with subdued light to reduce disruption of the plants. It was our favorite place to come, dark, quiet, and alternative. Talia was dressed in the battle fatigues of Conflict for Mars. She had created insignia and ribbons to indicate her rank of commander in the Plaizaar Regiment. Marta was dressed as a vudahn priestess with charms and amulets hung around her neck, a short crop top and swirling peasant skirt in bright patterns and colors, and her hair teased into a wild tangle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were sipping drinks, while taking a break from dancing, when my phone rang with Detective Bishop's ring tone. "Shit," Talia muttered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mason, we have wild dogs running loose in the park. They aren't normal ones. We need everyone to help contain this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, but I'll need someone to get me. I'm at the Midnight Garden in the Village."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sending a car. Be outside in ten minutes. We're in the north end of the park. I'll send someone that knows where we are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Marta," I started, once I'd hung up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Police stuff?" Marta asked. I nodded. "Is it alright if I stay at the party?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, it is an open event. YOu know the subway numbers to get back?" She nodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia followed me toward the door. "I'm coming with you, no argument."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure? There's a good chance they will find out who and what you are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok. Helping is more important than hiding."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They probably won't let you in the cruiser," I started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They will, just get the back door open somehow," Talia said through a strange smile. She fingered a ring on her finger and faded from sight. I could still see a faint outline of her, if the light was just right.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A cruiser pulled up just as Talia faded out. "Mason."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Polina? They called you out for this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I can hold my own, if needed. Get in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you open the back? I'd like to drop my spare costume bits in the back." She flipped a switch and I opened the back door. Talia slid in after I had tossed my fake weapon and cloak in. We accelerated away at a fast pace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something dark crawled up my nerves, nagging at me, as we roared toward the park. Every time I tried to get a handle on it, it would skitter away, just out of reach.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mason, follow me. We're headed toward the Leskar and the Mere. So far we have seen at least six very large canines." She handed me a headset comm and headed into the trees. She didn't see me open the door for Talia. Once she was out, we jogged after Polina.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Chatter came through the comm as soon as I had it in place. The canines were herding people around the trees and dodging us. It was soon apparent they were playing with us, darting into view just enough to keep us chasing them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two hours after the arrival of the Section 13, the canines disappeared. Half an hour later we called off the search, having uncovered no trace of where they came from or went. We were getting ready to head back to headquarters when a call came in to Bishop. She muttered quietly into her comm for a few minutes, then waved me over. "Mason, do you or your mom know anyone at the Met? There's been theft and I'd like to get background on what was taken."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't, but I can give mom a call and see if she does. Do we know what types of art were taken?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Items from a Nasazi collection."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stepped a bit away and made the call. "My mom has some familiarity with the Nasazi. She has consulted for the special collections group about the Nasazi," Talia whispered from a shadow near me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ms. Marissa Arakov has some familiarity with Nasazi items."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is her expertise?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alternative possibilities, similar to our team," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Call her. Have her meet us at the Met," Bishop requested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ms. Arakov arrived at the Met shortly after we did. "Shan, what's going on? Why are the police here? You were very cryptic on the phone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Some Nasazi items were stolen this evening. I was hoping you might know if they have any alternative properties, or if they might be dangerous in Awakened hands. This is Section 13. We deal with Veil situations." I introduced the members of the team, then introduced Talia as she appeared from the shadows near Ms. Arakov's cab. "I see you brought Talia. Good thinking." Her quickly damped surprise almost gave things away, but the rest of the team was distracted with the theft.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talia has helped me occasionally. She should see this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We followed Bishop into the building and down into the lower storage areas. The curator started listing off the missing items. Most were pot sherds and knife points. Ms. Arakov was only half listening until he mentioned a ceramic fragment that had a very rare Nasazi pattern on it. "That's the important one," Ms. Arakov said. "There is a Nasazi legend about the Place of Restless Spirits, a place where the gods and man could easily meet. Some of us thought that fragment might provide clues about it. Unfortunately, Nasazi histories were all oral. So to fully understand the item, we would need a Nasazi with enough ancient lore to recognize it. None of our inquiries found anyone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you have any pictures of the item?" Talia asked. The curator silently handed pictures to Talia. She thumbed through them and stopped abruptly, "This looks like something I've seen." She pulled her laptop out of her bag and started flipping through bookmarks. "Here," she turned the laptop so we could see, "it's a memory enhancer. It isn't of much use unless you have someone with memories of the events the enhancer targets." The image on the screen was a mandala-like pattern, engraved into a copper disk. Parts of the pattern on the ceramic fragment looked similar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Honey, that's a gaming site."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Doesn't matter, mom. The idea is sound and it would explain how the Nasazi might have hidden the location. It sounds like what happened was very bad."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But it wouldn't be of use unless the thief had a Nasazi in their pocket, one with enough knowledge of the old ways for the enhancer to work. Would there be any Nasazi that remember enough for the enhancer to have a chance?" I added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There were a couple of really old men, in a village in northern Yew Nexica, that know some of the old stories. The lead on the Nasazi collections met with them a few times when crating the items for the collection. Ms. Elisha Bradley, the lead, would have contact data. I can call her," Ms.Arakov said. At Bishop's nod, she pulled her cell phone. "Elisha will be here soon."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I reached out while we were waiting, trying to determine if this was more than just a theft. Veil energy was concentrated at the back of the vault and near the shelf where the enhancer had rested. It was only bad luck that the thief had crossed a detector and triggered the alarms. Otherwise the theft might have remained undetected until the next time the collection was inventoried. None of the images I picked up revealed the identity or appearance of the thief.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sorry it took so long," an older woman said as she hurried up. "Marissa, what are you doing here? They told me some of the Nasazi artifacts were stolen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They were. They called me because Shan knew I had worked on the project. The curator has the list of missing items. One of them was the strange pottery fragment with the unidentifiable pattern on it. The one you said your Nasazi contacts made a big deal of."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Elisha turned pale at that. "Do you have any cop ways of contacting other police? Some way to check on those two old guys? They live outside of Cathedral Rock, Yew Nexica and have no phone service."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why would they be in danger?" Bishop asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They were worried when I was talking to them. They seemed to think there were secrets that people would kill for related to the Nasazi past. I was asked to keep certain information about the strange pattern to myself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Such as the memory enhancer aspect of it?" asked Talia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How could you know that? I never told Marissa about that." Elisha replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It just seemed likely when I looked at the pattern. There are other memory patterns around the world to give clues," Talia replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please, get word down there. The local sheriff was Albert Mattsen. He knows my contacts personally."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Polina, get on the radio to the precinct and see if you can get a message through. Is there anything else you can tell us? Were there suspicious people or events recently regarding these artifacts? Anything strange at all could be a clue," Bishop asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ms. Bradley, how much do you know about these artifacts?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why? You don't think...?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They were targeted specifically. Maybe you should tell us everything you know about them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know that much. Most of them weren't unique enough to be worried about. The pattern piece was presented to me by the two old men. They wanted me to hide it away, somewhere no one would think to look. It wasn't intended for display. I complied with that, although it got into the online catalog system when it was inventoried. I didn't notice right away, but I had it pulled as soon as I found out. They said it would help someone with 'the memories' find the Place of Restless Spirits, but they wouldn't give details on the place itself. All I know is what anthropologists have pieced together over the years. In the years building up to 1150 the rains were becoming less frequent and the water supplies were drying up. Nasazi were starving from lack of food. By 1150 things were desperate enough that the shamans decided to try a major ritual to return the rains. They left the villages and cities and gathered at what would be the Place of Restless Spirits. The process built for many days, ending in a massive final ceremony. One warrior staggered back to the nearest village and died. He would only say that a great unrest had been released and all the shamans had died."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was about to ask more when Bishop's radio squawked again. "Shit! There's been a break in at the 5th Ave. branch of the library, rare collections. No rest tonight. It sounds like they may not have been successful, but we need to get there. The senior curator, Fred Hayes, will meet us at the entrance," Bishop said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That collection holds magic related manuscripts. I'd like to come along," Ms. Arakov added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's not standard procedure," Bishop replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you know about this collection?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've used it a few times. There are some extremely dangerous items in it. In the wrong hands, very bad things could happen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, you can come along, but stay in the background," Bishop replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once again we were waved through the police line and taken deep into the library building. The rare collections were stored in an environmentally controlled vault in the deep basements. The officer at the vault door had little to add from the initial report. The alarms had sounded, but when the guards arrived, no one was in sight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wandered the nearby areas, reaching out until I felt energies swirling in the room. The heaviest concentration was around the vault. Dark, coiled energy, waiting for something to trigger it. A fainter trace of something different took me down a hall to a section of rooms to the left of the vault. I tried the door, swung it open, and fumbled on the lights. I couldn't stop the startled gasp I made when I saw a body half out of the floor. It was human and wearing dark black clothes. It was slumped over, blood pooled under its mouth. The smell of burnt flesh permeated the room. "Bishop, call the coroner and meet me down the left side hallway. I have a body," I said into my comm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While we waited for the coroner, I carefully walked into the room, reaching out until I could see what happened. I didn't get much. The corpse materialized in the floor, screamed in shock and pain, before dying almost immediately. I did see a talisman roll away from his left hand and lodge under a table. I had Polina process it before taking it in a gloved hand and examining it. I heard a bit of hiss from the door and saw Talia had poked her head into the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hurried over to her and pulled her back from the scene. "No need for this to be lodged in your head."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Too late, lover. Did you find a twelve sided gem, probably an emerald? This is a Gate Jump gone bad," She said, pushing past me, into the room. She walked around the corpse, staring at it from several angles. "Definitely matches the description of a blocked jump. Most spells and items try to protect the jumper from this kind of thing. Only severe interference will result in a mis-jump this bad." I held up the evidence bag and showed her the stone. "That's a gate director. You know Gates will allow travel from this realm to others. They have another effect as well. Since they bleed energy into the realm where they are, that energy can be used to 'jump' from place to place in the realm. It take a locator gem, like the one you found, or powerful spells."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Marissa, what's this about?" I heard a voice down the hall ask.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fred, thanks for coming. I'm here with the police, for the break in you were called about."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mr. Hayes, you are here to let us in and to determine if anything is missing," Bishop explained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hayes keyed open the vault, then Bishop and our team went in first, clearing the area. When the radio crackled with the all clear,  I led Hayes and the Arakovs to where the rest of the team was in the back of the vault. They were waiting near a heavy glass case, that radiated thick, hot waves of menace, driving me back a step when I approached too closely. "What's in this case?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really old and very rare books of magic, spells, and theory. We have one of the seven copies of 'Gates of the Web Queen', written by Giovanni Astalli. It is supposed to describe a way to walk the Webs to the queen and provide supplications to prevent her killing the supplicant. There is another, 'Dimensions of the Evil One', written by Enrico Borbone, that is supposed to detail a mystic realm between this world and Hell. Others describe early Cothloc rituals, laws, and leaders. We have a diary that belonged to Ian Fredricks who supposedly knew of and watched gates between worlds. The diary is incomplete and no one has found any of the gates he was supposed to watch. Finally, there are alchemic and magic treatises on spells and potions. It is one of the most complete collections outside the Cothloc City of Light, the holy city of the Heirophancy," Hayes replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything appear to be missing?" Bishop asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. It looks like the case was never breached," Hayes answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The copy of Nasazi Mysticism and Demonic Influence by Ferdinand Escobar, is kept in this case, right?" Ms. Arakov asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. Why do you ask?" Hayes replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This appears to be the night for the targeting of Nasazi items," Ms. Arakov answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What types of security do you have on this vault?" Bishop asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hayes answered with a list of standard security items, motion detectors, fire and smoke systems, perimeter alarms, and the like when Bishop asked him about security. "Mr. Hayes, we have a body in a side room and there is something on that case we are close to. We need to know to keep my team out of danger," I said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hayes detailed several high powered magic systems and spells placed as protection. He finished by giving Olivia Bishop as the primary contact for the magic defenses.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shan?" Talia slipped up close to me and whispered. "What if dead guy wasn't the only one?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stopped dead for a second, then turned to the police team. "Casey, Aragon, go cover the vault entrance. Bishop, call your sister Olivia and see if the jump blocking spell can report how many jumps it blocked. Arakov, get a comm and coordinate with Bishop. Fisher, Vijahz, with me, weapons hot," I barked, just like I would in Conflict for Mars. Everyone jumped into motion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We slipped back to the vault door, close behind Casey and Aragon. I picked up the trail immediately, motioning for Vijahz and Fisher to follow close, yet keeping a clear field of fire. It took them a moment and a hurried explanation to get them where I wanted them. The trail led to the section of the vault farthest from the case and our group.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A large distortion of energy hunched close to one of the shelves. I stopped and looked around, as if I couldn't see anything, then moved past the area. I motioned to Fisher and Vijahz that I planned to sneak up on the target. They stared out me without understanding until I dragged them farther away and explained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We moved back toward the target, again, moving like we were searching for something. At the very last minute I turned to the point on the floor and said, "I can see you. Stand and identify yourself." The distortion didn't move. "Vijahz, toss me your baton and cover me," I added, snagging the baton out of the air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The shimmer flickered and resolved into a man, rising, hands glowing with energy. He made motions as if he were going to throw something. Time seemed to slow as Fisher and Vijahz started to raise their weapons in slow motion. The figure started his throw as I dropped the baton. My hand shot out, just as he moved to complete his throw. A blazing purple bolt burned through his mouth and out the back of his head. He dropped like a stone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nausea rose in waves, sorrow, fear, and shock fighting adrenalin focus for dominance as my vision started to collapse in on itself. I could feel my body starting to shake. I grabbed my roiling emotions and reactions, threw them in a mental box, slammed the lid, and snapped locks closed on it. I drew three deep, shuddering breaths. Utter calm settled over me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"One hostile neutralized. XO, Casey, any contacts?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Negative, commander," Talia answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, no, I don't think so," Casey answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"XO, check with Mr. Hayes and see what it will take to lock down the vaults and let Casey know. Fisher, Vijahz, one more sweep once the vault is locked down."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Affirm, commander." A couple moments later she said, "Casey, close the vault doors. That should engage locking and security."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Locked down," Casey replied, seconds later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Our second sweep came up clean. We returned to find Talia in a loose fighting crouch, her knives out and ready. The left one folded back along her left arm to block and slash, the right one held low and forward for attacking. She rose when she saw us and dropped them into their sheaths in her boots. I first saw Talia with her knives when we were sixteen. I had thought they were just for show until I learned she was training three days a week with Martin Esterhaaz. Then she invited me to watch some of her bouts and I learned she was very good with them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's next, boss?" Talia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We need a sweep and clean of the outside corridors so we can get the civilians clear. Don't want any more hostiles slipping in as we leave. You, Aragon, and Casey will be Sweep 1. Fisher, Vijahz, and I will be Sweep 2. If you find hostiles, neutralize in any way necessary. Perri, Polina, a dead hostile is back the way we came. Examine it for any information it might give. Bishop, you and the rest of the team keep the civilians safe." I noticed Hayes watching me with fear in his eyes. Ms. Arakov was fighting back a smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What type of hostile?" Perri asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Human, male. I killed it with an energy blast," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We swept the corridors, but all we found was a faint gate signature down the side away from the corpse in the floor. Polina and Perri found nothing on the downed hostile. Perri said we would have to wait for DNA for ID. My blast through the face had destroyed any chance of dental records and the misfiring of its spells had burned its hands away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective Bishop, will we need to wait for Internal Affairs to clear this incident, or can we get the civilians out?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"IA doesn't know what to do with us. We can bag and tag the bodies once Polina and Perri finish with them. They can wait for the meat wagon. Mr. Hayes can secure the vault as soon as we get the hostile out of it. How did you know there would be another?" Bishop asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is the best way to get into a locked area?" Talia asked, before I could respond.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Get someone with a key to open it," Bishop responded slowly. Talia smiled at her. "What was that stunt you pulled, Mason?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Small unit tactics, Conflict for Mars style. Does the academy have a tactics course? Might be good if we could go through it," I answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ms. Arakov and Talia left while the team made its way back to the station. After filling out our reports, we broke for sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was just leaving the building when Ash Aragon called to me. "Detective Mason, want to grab a quick drink?" I stopped, more from surprise than from desire. Aragon had always been one of the most distant of the group. Her normally cold eyes held something else as she quickly caught up to me. She was impressive, tall, muscled, with a fighter's movements. Her face was strong jawed, maybe pretty if she would smile, but her normal look was cold and calculating.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now? I'm dead tired," I answered, still trying to read what was in her eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please," she said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, sure, you know of somewhere?" The 'please' startled me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's a place near here, caters to cops and stays open as late as possible. It's a short walk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I motioned for her to lead the way. She dropped back to walk beside me and said, "I know I'm cold. It's just me. I, well, let me get a drink first. I'm no good at talking." She abruptly stopped talking and sped up her pace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Maybe eight minutes later we rounded the corner on Water St. She led the way to a place called Storm Haven. Inside was a dark bar, dressed in a Jamacain motif. A tall, deadlocked Jamacain man rose from a stool behind the bar when we walked in. There were a few other cops in the place, seated at the booths along the walls, talking quietly. The tables in the center were empty, their candles extinguished. "Aragon," he waved from the bar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Derrick, this is Detective Mason, from the squad. Mason, this is Derrick Castle. He owns and runs this haven from the world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Charmed," he said, giving a bow. "What you having?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The usual," Aragon said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took me a while to think of something, since I usually didn't dink much. "Do you have Hensey cognac, otherwise, a gin and tonic."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Derrick returned with the drinks. I reached for cash but Aragon said, "Got this." Drink in hand, she led the way to a table near the back. "I'd sit at the bar, but I don't want to be overheard."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I finally identified the look in her eyes as nervousness as we sat. "Where did you learn what you did tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Which thing that I did?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The tactics stuff. You and the Arakov woman were tight, like you had training. You were SWAT level, maybe military level, but you don't seem military."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I just looked at her, trying not to laugh, it was so crazy. "From video games. We learned it from first person shooters and massively multi-player combat games. I'm surprised it translated to reality."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wherever you learned it, very few can do the transition from regular person to battle commander in three breaths. The commanders I've known were always in command mode. They couldn't let go and be people anymore. I want to learn, both the tactics and the focus. Can you teach me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could try, but wouldn't it be easier to get tactics through the police academy?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Won't happen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But Detective Bishop..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It won't happen. We're a joke to the department. A place they send the screw-ups and misfits. They don't care what happens with us. If we stop something, great, but we aren't worth their time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How are we being paid?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did Detective Bishop tell you about our little group?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We exist for two reasons. The first is we know things that the higher-ups don't want told to the public, otherwise they'd fire us. Instead, they buy our silence through very generous pay and incredible benefits. The second is to keep the resident strange in line."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They don't want you out there, taking on things the clueless don't want to know about. We try to keep what you do quiet and point you where they want you. Thing is, for the Stranges I've met before, this was a non-issue. I've seen three since I was transferred in two years ago. The first one died three months after I started. The second lasted a year and a half, the third lasted three months. None of them were any good at detecting or dealing with what needed doing. Now you, you are the real thing. You have magic, instincts, combat and leadership skills, and you keep cool under pressure. With you, we can make a real difference."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But they won't want us to, is that it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Honestly, I don't know. From what I've seen, it could go either way." We sat in silence for a while, each lost in thoughts of our own. At last she kind of shook her head and said, "I have to ask, was that your first kill?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, it was." She watched me as I answered. I knew what she was looking for, but the lock down held my reactions back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I know what you did, with your feelings. You know that can only be a temporary thing, right? You can't leave things locked away. The images won't stay in the box. You need to talk to someone. It doesn't matter if it is a shrink, friends, or others that have killed. You just need to talk it through. You don't want to end up like me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You seem fine to me, Ash," I deliberately used her first name to see how she would respond.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know nothing about me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would trust you with my life. You are competent and at least as well adjusted as anyone I've met."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She gave her bark of a laugh. "I'll tell you about me, just not tonight. We both need sleep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I look forward to it," I answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She just looked at me for a long time, then finished the last of her drink. "Guess we should get some sleep. Think about what I asked, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I nodded slowly, "I will."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You need a ride anywhere? It's kind of late for the subway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure. Could you drop me in The Village, near the Arakov Market?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a second her face twitched into an almost smile, "You and the Arakov woman, I thought so. It's cool." My face was flaming as I followed her to the door, making me glad the place was so dark.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia was still awake when I arrived at her place, even though it was five in the morning. She was sitting with her mom, in the kitchen of the common area, sipping tea. "You're the new Strange," Ms. Arakov said it as a statement. I nodded. "Talia says you can see through her shell image. Is that true?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hesitated, looking between the two of them, before asking, "What do you mean by 'shell image'?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A shell image is a camouflage spell that lets us look like everyone else in this realm, so we don't stand out as other. Talia says you can see through hers. Can you see through mine as well?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," I replied slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The change came when you were sick." Again, it was a statement rather than a question. "I don't know why it never occurred to me. The Queen of the Web has given you a great honor." I just stared at her, uncertain how to react. "What you and Talia did at the museum was amazing. I am so proud of you both."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia opened her mouth at the same time I did, but her mom spoke before we could, "I was wrong about all that time you two spent playing those games. Before I came here, I lived in Sphere and trained with the Asylum guards. Your reactions were worthy of them. Be proud of what you are." Her eyes turned bright, "Just be careful. I don't want to lose either of you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I sat for a moment, staring into my cup, then said, "I need some help. I used a dangerous mind trick tonight to get through the emergency. Before the night is out, I need to defuse it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you need?" they asked, almost at the same time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I stuffed all my reactions of dealing with the hostile into a mental box and sealed it tight. I dare not leave it sealed too long, or I might start to fear it so much that I will never open it. Everyone says that way is madness. I want the two of you to help me through my reactions when I open the box. I expect I will throw up, get the shakes, and go through an emotional maelstrom from my first kill," my voice was completely calm, since everything was still locked away. "Could we start in Talia's bathroom, then move to her room once the pukes are over?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course!" Ms. Arakov said. Talia didn't say anything, just came over and wrapped her arms around me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next few hours were awful. Once I opened the locks, it all boiled out, the fear, the sorrow, the shocked look on the man's face as my energy blast burned through his face. The smell of scorched flesh and the sound of the body hitting the floor. I threw up everything I could and kept dry heaving for several spasms longer. Talia held me and her mom wiped away the bits clinging to my face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We retreated to Talia's room and they held me while I shook and cried like I never had before. Every time I closed my eyes, the scene replayed, over and over again. I knew the horror would fade with time, but it didn't help for those hours.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can you talk about it?" her mom asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was so horrible. One moment we were looking at a shimmer on the floor, the next, he was rising up, threatening my team. I didn't even think about what I was doing. I just blasted him down. I didn't try to stop him, or talk to him, just killed him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia's mom took my face between her hands, turned me to look directly at her, and said, "I am not trying to reduce the impact, or say you shouldn't feel bad for the death of the man at the library. Just consider this, humans can be monsters too. Keep that in mind before you judge yourself harshly. He would have killed you, or one of your team. It doesn't make it easier, but it does make it reasonable."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My mom and Mr. Hayes were discussing the books in the case. A lot of unpleasantness could be caused by any single book from that collection. Imagine what they could do with the set," Talia added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know some of that. Shit, in Conflict for Mars I wouldn't hesitate, but this was a real person. This wasn't an avatar that would respawn the next time we fought that team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At least we know you aren't a psychopath," her mom said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We sat in silence for a while, each of us staring into the distance. At last I asked, "Can you tell me anything about Stranges?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A little. There are Stranges and then there are Stranges. Many are just adequate. They have the ability to detect threats and some skill in dealing with them. The better ones have magic of their own and are adept at coping with anything the Veil throws at them. The truly powerful are chosen by the Queen of the Web and have the ability to see things that have been touched by magic, and the events that occurred. They have powerful magic of their own and the ability to fight with great skill and tenacity. As you come into your own, I expect you will be one of the truly powerful ones."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The previous Strange was one of the weaker ones, right?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. That's why he didn't last very long. There is something I would recommend, since you are chosen of the Queen. Myth says Stranges can become more powerful and centered by going through a Gate at least once in their career. You should let Talia or I take you to Sphere. That way you can see some of the wonders behind the Veil. It will help offset the ugliness you will see as a Strange."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would like that, but only after I've slept."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could skip school and sleep here," Talia said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd love to, but, ah fuck it, great idea. Let me call Natasha, uh Ms.Korikova, and have her mark me out for the day."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"First name basis with the ogre of Davisson? Should I be worried?" Talia asked, mostly teasing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I kissed her passionately, forgetting for a moment her mom was there. "You should not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her mom was smiling when we broke apart. "Get a room, you two!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're in it," Talia answered back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I left a message on Natasha's phone when she didn't pick up. I hoped the phone hadn't woken her. Then I called Marta and left a message for her as well. As soon as her mom left, we stripped, falling into bed as soon as our clothes were off. Her beauty tempted me, but I slipped into sleep before I could do anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We woke in the mid afternoon, had a lazy meal, then Talia headed off to work. I made my way back to school and up to my room, expecting Marta to be there, until I remembered she had another theatre practice. My books were on the desk, but when I looked at them, I just couldn't do it. Instead, I curled up on the makeshift window seat we had thrown together. We had arranged it with a backrest so you could lean back and look out the window without twisting too much.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta found me that way, staring out at Jefferson Centre. She stood by the beds, staring at me for a long time before she said, "Are you ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, no." She waited for me to continue, so I finally said, "I am sitting here, realizing my dream is unraveling and I don't know how to handle it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Being here and dancing?" I nodded. "Are there other ways you could dance?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I had my life planned around dance as a profession."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want you to seriously listen to what I am about to tell you. I saw you when you were saving us. That was the most alive I've seen you, even more alive than when you dance. What does your girlfriend say when you are in the thick of it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She says to become the best Strange the world has known. Wait, what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did I know? It was obvious at the party. I like her, not that it matters. You two fit together, like my aunt and her partner. You should have seen your face when you got the call, though. There was resignation, but there was more excitement. I think you like it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess I do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You seem changed by this last one. Can you talk about it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not supposed to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She talked to me of school things and didn't seem to expect me to answer back. Somehow, it helped. "You should sleep," she said, the fourth time my head slumped back. Silently, I stood, dressed for bed, and fell into it. "I can go if my light is going to bother you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please stay. I'd like the company." She settled down and started in on her assignments. Several hours later she dressed for bed, turned out the light and climbed into her bunk. I'd tried to sleep, but every time my eyes closed the killing blossomed in my memory again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tried not to make any noise, but something must have alerted her. "Something very bad happened, didn't it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There was a death." It popped out before I could hold it back. I heard her sharp intake of breath. "No, not anyone I knew, which was good, because I killed it, him, the victim, the..." I ran out of words suddenly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She dropped from the bunk, slid onto mine, and held me tight. "Shit, I'm so sorry. Can I help?" My mind blanked and the tears started again. The sobs weren't as harsh as they had been with Talia, but I soaked her shoulder and almost shook us off the narrow bed. I told her everything, in short fits and bursts of words. I don't remember if I was coherent or not, just that I asked her over and over again not to talk about it with anyone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I don't remember falling asleep, until early morning light woke me. Marta was still wrapped up around me, sleeping soundly. It took some work to wake her up. "Sorry, but I have to get ready for class."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She blinked sleepily at me, then woke up, slightly embarrassed. "Are you any better?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A bit, and I will be better soon," I paused before continuing, "Thank you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are going to leave soon, aren't you? This is going to keep happening, isn't it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I nodded slowly, "I probably am. I'm very sorry." I looked down, disappointed, sad, and at a loss for words.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She pulled my head up, until she could look me in the eyes, and said, "Don't you cut me out. We've been through too much for you to just walk away. I want to help. I've asked my aunt to send me the old family books. They talk of, well, of the kinds of things we've seen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I returned to the dorm after an uninterrupted day of classes. Marta had left a note on my desk asking me to meet her in the top floor practice room. She waited until I had closed the door before saying, "I was thinking about what you told me and I have lots of questions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I probably don't have many answers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I got a call from my aunt saying she has sent the books I asked her for. Thing is, they're the kind of information that shouldn't be left where they are easily found. Do you have a place I can store them? Will there be places we can talk without being overheard? You won't be able to get back in here after you leave."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I had thought of staying with my parents, but it's not fair to make them face this stuff."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could shack up with your girlfriend," she said, eyes glinting in amusement.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I pretended to consider it, then said, "That would be fun, but talk about no privacy. I need to talk to Korikova about how to, how to drop out." Tears burned in my eyes at the thought.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Next thing I knew, Marta was holding me again. "You have friends who love you. Never forget that. Now, let's get dinner and try to lighten this up. That super hero movie you wanted to see just opened. We could go catch that tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No buts. You need to be distracted for a few hours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The movie was better than I had hoped, and it mostly provided the distraction I needed. Although, when the loose group of misfits finally came together to fight the big battle at the end, it reminded me of what we had been discussing. I thought about Korikova, Talia, Leia, Marta, and Section 13, all of whom wanted to help.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slept better than I had the night before, but thoughts of where to go and what to do intruded from time to time, and the killing wasn't completely gone either. I woke in the morning with Marta wrapped around me again. "Um, sorry, but you seemed really restless and, I, uh, well, I was having nightmares, and..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok," I replied. "I think it helped." It had, and that started other disturbing trains of thought. She was as comfortable to sleep with as Talia, just in different ways. "Nightmares from the attack?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A little, but  I have had this recurring nightmare from when I was young. I had to find someone's soul, before thieves sold it on the open market. You helped calm that down last night."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have some things I need to get done today. You going to be around for dinner later?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've got a theatre side project, so it will have to be closer to the end of dinner, but, yeah. See you then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, I'll be here." I hurried out the door. Too many things were changing and I needed somewhere quiet. In the end, I ended up at the laundromat. Leia looked up, but didn't say anything when I settled into one of the hard plastic chairs and stared at a running dryer. A few minutes later she set a coffee mug in the chair next to me and went back to her desk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I sat for hours with thoughts bouncing randomly in my head. I had reached no conclusions when a sandwich appeared in the chair next to me. I looked up at the clock and saw four hours had gone by. Leia walked over when she saw me looking at it. "If you want to talk, let me know," she said before returning to her desk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The sandwich was excellent and bore the wrapper from a nearby shop. Not one of the chains that had sprung up over the years, but one of the neighborhood family run shops. I ate it, then walked over to her desk. "Have a few minutes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course," she rose and went through the ritual of letting me into the hidden apartment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She didn't say anything, just waited for me to start. It took a long time, but when I started, it all boiled out in a torrent. She waited silently for me to run out of words. "I might be able to help with the place to stay," she said slowly. "There's a two story loft space, in that center building," she pointed out the windows. I had looked at the laundromat building in Etakt World Viewer and seen how it had grown from a small building in the center, then a larger brick building was added in a "U" shape from the left, and finally a lower, concrete building on the right. The the inner roof was added, forming a two story area in the space not filled with original buildings. "You could use it for a share of the utilities. Since the only way in is through the tunnels, you can come and go without being traced to this place. There are easy points of exit, including one in Coventry Village and the Annex. I know the owner and could get you on the lease for one of the apartments that contain a tunnel entrance. I can show you the loft, if you'd like."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I very much would."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She took me back down the stairs, closed the door to her room, and once again pushed a complex pattern. Another section of wall swung open to stairs down. At the bottom, we followed a narrow passage to the end. More brick pushes revealed circular stairs going up.  "I will show you how to set this to a pattern you want. I'd recommend you go another step and add a RFID key as well, but I'm just paranoid that way. You can put the RFID in anything, jewelry, implant, whatever, or use a standard card," Leia said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, an RFID second stage would be good. My own paranoia is on the rise from things I've seen. How hard is it to do an implant?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Depends on your pain threshold and where you want it. You could insert it or get a doctor to do it for you. If you're into piercings, there might be some body jewelry you could put it inside and carry it that way. They aren't very big."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the top was the loft. The room Was slightly "L" shaped, covering the entire top of the center building. Directly across from the stairs was a section that had been converted into a two story section of offices. There were two on each floor, with two single person restrooms on the lower floor. There was a freight elevator immediately to the right of the stairs. "This comes out in the tunnels as well. I will show you how to get things to it when you need to bring stuff in. You can modify this space in any way you like."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why are you offering all this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's been chatter on the darker, more sinister, side of the net about what you did at the library. You have come to the attention of Gladius and other covert groups that would want to control or neutralize you, because you aren't the usual ineffectual strange. Look, I know I'm a raving paranoid, but that means I understand the desire to have a safe place. This will give you a secure area to fall back to. As long as you are careful getting here, it should be very hard to find."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Speaking of security, what if I wanted to invite a friend or two over or move in a roommate?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It would be up to you to determine if you trusted them enough. My area is set up so it would not be noticed by your visitors. I would ask that you not talk about it. If you need anonymous, secure network access, I can run a high capacity fibre line in to a local router. I'd recommend hard-line connections to reduce detection. You can also use the laundromat wireless for general net access. I think phones work from that room, but you'd need to check."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let me know if you need money for the RFIDs and I will slowly slip cash to you. Unfortunately, most of my resources are in traceable places."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You might consider sliding some of it into less traceable locations. When you're ready, I can help with that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I might be interested, once I figure out my new life. When can I move in?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The lease at Coventry will be ready for you to sign on Monday. You can start using this space once we have the access codes set."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We walked back down and she helped me set that access to the stairs, to the elevator, and from the main tunnels. She handed me an RFID chip once we were back in her apartment, then we set that into my doors as well. "Where is Coventry Annex and what size is the apartment?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's the big complex near the High Street subway station. The apartment is a two bedroom and mostly furnished, so you can live there while you set up your space."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was about to leave when the images hit. Disoriented, I landed hard on Leia's bed. Old, falling apart houses, surrounded by trees, docks, warships, all flickered back and forth. "Shan, are you alright?" Leia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Huh?" I muttered inarticulately. I saw a ruined house, white, with dark blue trim and ivy climbing up it. In front was a wrought iron fence. A young man was walking by when darkness flowed from the house and attacked him. The sun was dropping and the shadows long, maybe four or five a night, this time of year.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I asked if you are ok," Leia said again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There will be an attack this afternoon, but I don't know where. I see old warships, then a ruined house and a wrought iron fence. The house is covered in ivy. It feels like it might be close," it was hard to pull the details together, leaving my head pounding as I finished.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Might be Commodore's Row. There are several ruined houses and it is near the old naval yards. I've got a tunnel entrance there, so I have seen ivy over a lot of them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How quickly can we get there and what time is it now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mid afternoon and maybe twenty minutes to get there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's go then."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She led the way back into the tunnels and we set off at a rapid pace. She pointed out various branches and mentioned where they would take me. "You'll remember it eventually, once you start using them routinely."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The tunnel ended at an iron door into a basement. Light streamed in through broken windows, half the floor had collapsed into the front parts of the basement. Half rotten stairs led up to the main floor. A narrow strip of floor led to the back of the house and a second door into the overgrown yard behind. I could feel the darkness, not far away, like a thick, putrid stench on the breeze. The yards were not fenced, so only the overgrown plants slowed me down. Three houses down the feeling peaked, leading me to another back door. "Stay here. Whatever happens, don't follow me in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Three slow breaths focused me as I walked slowly toward the door. The darkness inside was thicker than what shadows could account for. The air grew colder and an actual stink of rotting meat grew stronger as I drew near. I drew three more breaths, trying to still myself even more. Suddenly, I could feel a clot of cruelty in the darkness, coming from down and to the left of where I stood.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside, the floor was in slightly better shape than the building we had emerged from. The stairs were less rickety as I eased down them. The voice came from the shadows as the stairs creaked under my feet, "I know you. You have almost been ours before. You are alone. I shall be the one to have you." The sibilant hiss of its voice shattered my calm, reminding me of claws twisting in my guts. I stumbled and slipped off the stairs, landing in slime, goo, and brittle sticks. "Ah, how sweet you taste!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Terror clawed its way up my throat. I heard an orgasmic moan from the shadows, "Oh, so sweet, so rich."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Its voice was seductive, pulling the terror ever higher, until a flicker of an iron box sped across my mind. In an instant I pulled the terror from me, like a heavy coat, and flung it into the box, slamming the lid, and locking it closed. Calm snapped over me, the shadows cleared, dispelled by the light streaming in through shattered windows. Only a clot of darkness remained, leaning against the far wall, startled by the sudden light.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No!" it shrieked, gathering to leap at me. The magic came almost unbidden. The first blast caught it mid leap, shearing a leg off. The second blast punched through its chest. It drifted into vapor before it landed on the carnage at our feet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The light revealed a sea of bodies, from almost fresh to only bones, covering the floor. I was half crouched in the putrefied flesh of one of the newer ones. I waited for the nausea to hit, but it never did. Levering myself up, I stepped carefully to the stairs and strode back up, into the late afternoon sun.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shit, now I know why you seemed so familiar. You look just like one of the women in the promo package for the first Conflict for Mars expansion," Leia gasped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nazrah Kaadesh, Supreme Commander, Plaizaar Regiment, I know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I bowed slightly, "The four elder clans were invited to help design, test, and promo the expansion. One of the perks was the chance to be mo-capped, uh, motion captured, for custom avatars. We could use them in game and they were used in the promo materials. Do you play?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I solo for Bronson's Raiders. Not many clans accept solos."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We do. Bronson's is a good clan, new, but very serious about their game."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, your second in command, Aeryn Solaris, has been routinely kicking my ass."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait, do you play Ayasha Zeriss?" She nodded. "My XO speaks very highly of you. She says you have great promise. If you ever want to change clans, let us know. We would accept you immediately. Now, you should get out of here, I have to call this in. Unless you want to be here when the cops arrive." I waited until she was out of sight, then released the locks on the box. It took several very long minutes for the terror to wash through me, followed by the horror at the number of bodies. When I was calm again, I dialed the number for Section 13.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Detective Bishop rolled up a short while later, with an entire team. She directed several into the building while she pulled me aside. "Officially, you should never go off on your own. It is entirely too dangerous. Officially, you report a possible incident to Section 13, where it is checked and verified. If an official response is needed, Section 13 will form a team and take care of it. Officially, I should place a reprimand in your file for not following procedure, however, since I never explained it to you, that seems a bit unfair. Do you understand?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I struggled for a few seconds to not tear her head off. Then what she was saying filtered up through the words. Silently, I nodded. "Good, now I think Aragon had a couple of questions. Shall I send her over?" I nodded again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey," Aragon said as she walked up. "You ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, just getting a lesson in plausible deniability. So, how should I call in something like this in the future?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Call Polina or I, on our personal phones. We will figure out how to get it checked out. Another option is to get a civilian to call in something weird. That's not as good, unless you know a civilian you can trust. That's quite the shit-pit you found down there. Looks like a lair that's been active a very long time. Was it another Yelgezeth? Did you scan the area?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, it was another one. That should take the count down to eight, I hope. I didn't do a scan at the time. I was a little shaken by finding the thing there. I will take a look now, unless I shouldn't?" I returned to the basement, stepping around and over as many bodies as I could. Reaching out with every sense I had revealed nothing other than the lair had been in use for a very long time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took until almost the end of the Davisson dinner time to finish the reports on the event. I sent Marta a text and called Talia asking if we could all meet at the Midnight Garden for food and drinks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I arrived last, after taking time to shower and change, to find Talia and Marta sitting at one of the back tables in the garden area. Both had drinks and both were staring into the garden. There was a tenseness around Marta that I hadn't seen since our first weeks at Davisson. "You guys ok?" I asked as I sat down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia leaned over and gave me a quick hug, Marta looked down at her drink, then blurted out, "Talia, I slept with your girlfriend. We just slept, she was so distraught, I have no excuse..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I froze, but Talia pushed back her chair, swooped down on Marta, and pulled her into a close hug. "I don't own Shan and she doesn't own me. I'm glad you were there for her. It was an awful night and If I hadn't had my mom and family, I would have had a wretched time the last two nights as well. No apologies are necessary, however, I am a bit envious that she got you all to herself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh," Marta looked completely confused. Talia released the hug and sat back down. Marta reached out a shaky hand and downed her drink in a single gulp. "I, uh, how, I don't understand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Simple, we've been friends for a lot longer than we have been lovers. Until now, I wasn't sure Shan wasn't asexual. She never had boyfriends or girlfriends in school."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't have time. I had dance," I answered, a bit more defensively than I had planned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia winked at Marta, "I think it's just she didn't have the right people pursuing her. Although, there was that one guy..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, until I figured out he was all ego and entitlement, over insecurity and possessiveness. I can admire cute boys, but the ego that comes with is a total turn-off," I answered back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tell me about it," Marta said bitterly. "My mom is very old school. She would flip if she knew I can't stand boys and only want to be with women. She keeps pressuring me to have babies, so she can have grandchildren. Until I was accepted to Davisson, she was setting me up with any guy of our heritage, trying to find the right one and get me married off. I think she hopes I'll flunk out so she can get me back on track, even though my father is very proud of me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Speaking of flunking out," I started. "I am going to have to drop out of Davisson. I had another incident today, this time where I was the first to know about it. I won't last long in classes if I keep running off all the time. Although, I did find a place to stay, when I have to move out of the dorms."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would it be private enough for the items from my aunt?" Marta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is very private. Final arrangements should be complete early next week. It will take some work to get it nice, but privacy and security will not be an issue."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And where is this magical place?" Talia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In the under bridge area. A friend of Detective Bishop had the space and has made it available." Talia had that look of disbelief she would get when something seemed too good to be true. "The owner knows what I am and wants to help. She's quirky, paranoid to the max, but also very wired in to the things I need to know." She continued to look skeptical and Marta was getting in on it too. "Look, I've met this person several times now and I trust her. Actually, you sort of know her too. She plays Ayasha Zeriss of Bronson's Raiders."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's the catch, though?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is no catch," I started  confidently, then slowed to a stop as something clicked in the back of my mind. "You have your laptop here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course," Talia answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is it up to date in terms of anonymizers and search hiding?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Seriously?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Seriously."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have to ask? Of course it is."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May I look up something?" Talia pulled it out of her bag, logged out, and handed it to me. My hands flew over the keyboard as I logged in and started several searches. The waitress came by for food and drink orders, then with our order, before my fingers slowed. The last three tries had yielded what I had thought. Two windows held old news articles and the third a series of photos. The first news article spoke of the death of Walter Cassaveras and the transfer of his entire fortune and holdings to his niece, Alucinia Matthilda Cassaveras. The second article discussed her disappearance from public view and mentioned that she maintained control through a small management team, hand picked, and sworn to secrecy about her location. The pictures showed Alucinia five years ago, at the time of the transfer. They showed a young woman who looked like a better groomed, well made up version of Leia Cassini. I paused, then cleared the searches, cleared the caches, and used the tools Talia had explained to make sure no trace of my results remained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia watched as I closed the laptop and slid it back to her. "Find what you wanted?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, wasn't what I thought." She stared at me in that way that said she knew there was more. After a few seconds, she returned to her food. Marta looked between us, the went back to her food as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia insisted on a second round of drinks and more conversation. Mostly we talked about school and anything interesting that had happened at the markets. "What are your plans?" She asked, as the third round of drinks appeared.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta stood, swaying slightly, and slurred, "Hold that thought. Must pee." She listed her way to the restrooms, returning after a few minutes. "Shit, what have I been drinking? It's hitting hard."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alien Blood," Talia replied. It's a fave of ours," Talia answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, wow. Shan, can you make sure I get back to the right room?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wimp," Talia added, with a slightly wicked smile. "You two could stay at my place. It's within staggering distance. Which reminds me, Alicia, another round please."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shan, what's next?" Marta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I talk to Na..., umm, Ms. Korikova on Monday and see what it takes to withdraw from school. Then I talk to Le..., my new landlord and see when I can move in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could stay at my place. You don't need to pay for a place," Talia said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't have to pay, remember? Besides, I don't want to disturb your family by coming and going and by the police presence that will show up with me. Same reason I don't want to stay with my parents."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Besides, there'll be strange related things that would be best hidden," Marta added, taking a big slug off the fresh drink at her elbow. "Are these all booze? They feel like all booze."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, just mixed really strong."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have to stop at this one," Marta mumbled. "What's in it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Normally, Everclear, Melon Liqueur, pineapple juice, and that yellow, caffeinated soft drink. The Garden mixes them special for us, more booze, and no soft drink," Talia replied, standing after finishing her drink.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm out of practice," I added as we wove our way to the door. Alicia smiled and waved as we left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We ended up at Talia's. I had looked at the subway station, but couldn't focus on the sign. We tried to be quiet as we stumbled up the stairs to her room. "I sleep naked and I get the middle," she said evilly as she stripped. I shrugged, stripped, and slid in on her left. Marta stared at us, without expression, for almost a minute. Her eyes roving over us as we pulled up the blankets. Then she smiled, stripped, and slid in on the right. Marta wrapped her arms around Talia first.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We slept in a tangle, at first drugged into a stupor. By morning, it was a conscious entangling. When I woke up, Marta was wrapped over Talia, smiling in her sleep. I watched her for a few minutes, before drifting back out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">About an hour later, we woke up, almost simultaneously. Marta spoke first, "Thank you, but you didn't have to get me drunk for this to happen. I've been so lonely here. That shit with my mom wanting grand kids and insisting I only see boys she accepts, then Davisson, where almost everyone has too big an ego to want to be with. The two of you are so lucky to have each other."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can have us, if you want," Talia said, pulling her into a tight hug. I looked at Talia for a moment, thought about the last few weeks, then smiled and added myself to the hug.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I don't want to come between you," Marta said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hope you will, many, many times," Talia said. Marta looked confused for half a second, then turned bright red.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't mind her. She's a gamer girl and has no social skills," I said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Says you, with at least as many hours in game as me. I'm serious, though. Shan's The Strange, my family is from another world, and you are an Awakened. We don't have to play by the rules of the clueless."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Clueless?" Marta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's what the Awakened call those who aren't aware," Talia answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll need to think about this, ok?" Marta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. There'll be things to figure out, but I think it'll be worth it," I said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I do too," Talia added. "Now, let's see if there's any food left downstairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'll love this part. Talia's family is full of awesome cooks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta handled the introductions and questions of the Arakov clan calmly. She was welcomed into the extended clan with the easy acceptance they showed so many. Talia had told me there were a few people that were expelled immediately, but I had never seen it happen. Marta responded with enthusiasm and tears of happiness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When we separated for the day, she told us it was the first time she had felt at home since leaving the country of her birth. I promised I'd see her later, but that I wanted to spend some time with Talia, in Conflict for Mars. I had been neglecting my duties as commander.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia had other plans, shoving me back into the bed when we were in her room. "Game later," was all she said. Our fingers, tongues, and bodies did the rest of the talking for a very long time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I made it back to Davisson in time to meet Marta for dinner. She didn't talk much at dinner, concentrating on other things. Back at the room, we both tried to focus on the class work that was due for Monday. I was having a hard time and I could see she was too. Several times she started to speak, before returning to stare at her books. We changed for bed in the same silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was already stretched out in bed when she returned from brushing her teeth. She climbed into her bunk and settled in. I drifted out slowly, only to be awoken some time later by a high pitched scream. Marta was sitting rigid in bed, staring into the distance when I leapt up to look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned her head when I said her name and wrapped my arms around her waist, but her eyes stared past me for a long time before slowly focusing on my face. It took a few minutes longer until I could help her down and settle her on my bunk. "Want to talk about it?" I asked, once I had my arms around her. She shook her head and buried her face in my shoulder, tears dropping silently into my top. Slowly her eyes closed and she slid back into sleep. I followed her down after a long time staring up at the bottom of her bunk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Monday morning found me in Korikova's office, explaining what I had to do. The process wasn't as complicated as I expected. Money would be refunded once I had moved out of the dorms and gotten sign-off from my current list of instructors. The most complicated part would be packing up my stuff and getting it to the new place.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had all the signatures by the end of Monday. Tuesday morning I packed up and called a cab to take me to the Coventry Annex. Marta was helping move boxes down to the street when she was called to arrange for the delivery of two crates of material. "Can I have these delivered to your place?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How big are they? I might have a better place to have them sent. Someplace even more secure. Find out if they can hold them for a day while I set it up." She nodded and went back to the call.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The papers at Coventry were even simpler. Leia's friend had filled in everything except my signature. Security was explained, I was asked how many keys I wanted, then she handed me a packet of information on the local area.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The apartment was far more luxurious than Leia had led me to believe. The furniture was new, comfortable, and stylish in a simple way. Both bedrooms were spacious, with queen sized beds and plenty of closet space. I was putting the last of my meager stuff away when I found the note from Leia. It was a simple diagram, pointing to the closet in the bedroom I had not chosen. When I looked inside, there was a faint click and a panel slid open. Behind it was a miniature panel of bricks, looking like the section in the tunnels. Pushing the same combination caused the back wall to swing back, revealing stairs down. Another envelope rested there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What the hell?" Marta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I smiled and replied, "This leads to the very secure location. If I knew the path that is." Inside it was a detailed set of instructions from the apartment entrance to the other apartment entry. "And this answers that. Want to check it out?" Marta just nodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I made sure the apartment door was locked, then we stepped onto the stairs. The secret door swung closed easily, revealing it was brick backed, with the same patterning. "Where are we?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yew Nork is riddled with old tunnels, storm drains, and abandoned subway lines. This is some part of that system." We walked for maybe twenty minutes, following the path in Leia's note. At the end was the other door I was familiar with. It took only a moment to open it and lead Marta up to the loft above. She stopped at the door and stared into the space. "This is amazing. What are you allowed to do with it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My land lord said anything I like. Why, you have some ideas?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will. Did your land lord say how we could get stuff in? Those stairs aren't wide enough for anything other than us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I pointed to the freight elevator. "I let the land lord know and anything I have delivered can get loaded onto this. I'll find out how to get the two crates shipped up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who is this mysterious benefactor anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Part of the deal is I don't tell anyone. If that changes, I will let you know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After Marta headed back to Davisson, I dropped by the laundromat and talked to Leia about deliveries. She told me to have them delivered to Coventry Village and she would get them moved to the loft. She also promised to deliver two more RFIDs Friday.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sleeping alone in the new place sucked. Nightmares of killing kept me awake and there was no one to help chase them away. By two in the morning I was almost desperate enough to call a cab and show up at Talia's.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia moved in Wednesday. Her signed poster of Conflict for Mars Clan Holds shared wall space with mine and the rest of her stuff helped the place feel more lived in. She just smiled, kissed me, and said she hoped I didn't mind her wanting to live with me. I smiled back and dragged her to the bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta called Thursday morning, to check if the crates had been delivered and if we could take a look at them. When she arrived, we hurried to the loft and levered them open. Inside were stacks of books, old sheets of parchment, bowls, knives, and objects I couldn't identify. Marta's eyes gleamed with excitement, "She sent me everything. I didn't expect that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was a note in the second crate. In it, her aunt said it was too dangerous for her to keep practicing. A shift in the government made pursuit of the old ways a serious crime. Many practitioners had been arrested. "Are you ok?" I asked when Marta continued to stare at the note.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She started slowly, "My mother was Cothloc, my father and his family were the old religion. I was their battlefield, or rather my 'soul' was. My dad seduced with honey, showing me how the old ways kept the village together, how it celebrated life and connection to the earth. My mother was all about the eternal torment and suffering I would endure if I failed to accept her 'loving god'. I escaped by running to my father's sister as often as I could. She was a high priestess of the old ways, steeped in the lore and magic traditions, even if she didn't practice the magic. I have missed her since coming here. And now, to find out she has to give it all up to stay safe, that's just tragic."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta stopped and drew a shaky breath. "When I was eight, my father died. It was very mysterious. He hadn't been sick, he just fell over dead one day. The village was too far away from the authorities to get an autopsy done. Shortly after he died, my mother moved us to the coastal city. It was mostly Cothloc. I was enrolled in a Cothloc school and force-fed her religion from then on. I survived, but only by pretending to convert. When I was twelve, she married my step-father and they moved us to Savnaugh. I might have gone mad if we hadn't lived there. Savnaugh had its own old ways and traditions. I learned how to find those who knew of them and learned what I could. In the end, my step-father proved himself by sending me to Davisson when he saw how theatre had become my passion." She stared into the distance for a long time after finishing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After we had pulled everything out and examined it in detail, Marta said quietly, "I'm thinking of dropping out of Davisson. I don't really belong there. I have a bit of talent, sure, but I don't have the drive for it. This, right here, is what I want to study. My mom be damned, this is my calling. I know I'll have to find some shit job to live, but I need to do this, even if I disappoint my step-dad."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you are certain, I won't try to talk you out of it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have something difficult to ask. May I live with you and Talia? I don't have to sleep with you. I can use the other room and stay out of the way..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I placed a finger across her lips to stop her and said, "If Talia says yes, I would love to have you with us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When will she be home? Can I ask her tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She'll be home after six. Until then, shall we dig into this? I know nothing of vudahn." For the rest of the day we organized her aunt's things and she explained a few things. It seemed a little odd to me, not being much of a believer, but I was willing to keep my skepticism in check.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We arrived back at Coventry a bit before Talia arrived. Marta was in the shower and I was toweling off my hair. "Visitors?" Talia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Marta's here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you let her shower alone?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I just looked at her for a minute, "Are you trying to get me to have sex with her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She kissed me with extreme passion, then said, "And if I was?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd be confused as to why, that's all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We all want each other. You do see that, right?" I nodded slowly, thinking about the past few days. "She knows you more than she does me. I think she'd be more comfortable with you making the first moves. I know we've never really talked about sex and such. I have a bit of a voyeuristic streak and I like the thought of the three of us together. I have been fantasizing about Marta with us since the Hallows Eve party," she said the last bit fast and nervously.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok," I said slowly, trying to wrap my head around it. "I have had a pretty sheltered upbringing, so it's taking me some time to decide how I feel. I know Marta has a very conservative background, especially from her mom. I think the three of us can work, but we should go really slowly. I don't want to loose a new friend by moving on her too quickly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good points. I grew up with thin walls and off-world norms. I have a hard time understanding the monogamy the clueless cling to. It seems like it just doesn't work very well most times. How about I let Marta lead on this, then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The shower shut off as I said, "I think that would be the safest way. She is going to ask if she can live with us, but I'll let her explain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta came in, with just a towel wrapped around her, just as I finished. "Oh, hi, I didn't hear you come in," she said through a deep blush. "I, uh, I want to ask you something, but I want to get dressed first." She hurried from the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not like..." Talia started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shh, I know, but she's nervous enough as it is."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta returned, dressed in a long T-Shirt, with a wad of paper in one hand. "Ok, better. Uh, Talia, I, can I move in here with the two of you? I'll find something so I can contribute to costs and food." She explained once more about her reasons for leaving Davisson.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course you can! There's something you should know though. I'm not exactly as I seem. If you are ok with the real me, then you are welcome here." A kind of shimmer in the air disappeared as Talia turned off her overlay image. "This is what I really look like."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta looked puzzled. "I don't see any difference."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia looked at me and I shrugged as she asked, "What do you mean? What do you see?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The same white hair, horns, and emerald cat eyes I've always seen." She laughed, almost normally, at Talia's look of surprise. "I saw a different image the first time I met you, but there was a shadow under it. I kept looking harder until I saw the real you. I've seen through the veil since I was a child. Something about you made it harder, but not impossible."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, what you see is what you get then. So, do really want to stay here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes! And I've been thinking about other things too. I went online and looked at polyamory sites and came up with this list of thoughts," she said, face a bit red. She shoved the papers into our hands and waited while we scanned them. They were a list of "rules" for a polyamorous group.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Polyamory Agreement<br/>
    <ol type="1" class="regtxt5">
        <li>The first rule is we talk about things that are good and things that are not</li>
        <li>The second rule is we talk about things that are good and things that are not</li>
        <li>Communicate above and beyond what you would expect to be enough</li>
        <li>No one here reads minds - Ask for what you need</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>You are responsible for your own needs, and communicating them to the others</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Respect private space when one of us needs some alone time</li>
        <li>No score keeping on time spent with other partner(s)</li>
        <li>Do not take sides in disagreements that don't directly impact you</li>
        <li>Take responsibility for your own actions</li>
        <li>Rely on yourself for internal validation - do not expect this to come from your partner(s)</li>
        <li>Do not seek to give your partner(s) happiness at the expense of your own - each person is responsible for their own happiness</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Does this mean..." Talia started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I want both of you as partners and lovers!" Marta replied, her face blazing red under her warm brown Carribae skin, her eyes open and direct, looking at each of us.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm honored." Talia spread her arms slightly, waiting until Marta slipped into them, then wrapping them around her. Marta held her close, then raised her lips and kissed Talia with hunger. Talia responded by dropping a hand to Marta's ass and pulling her closer in, returning the fierceness of the kiss. I felt a deep flutter in my belly, not jealousy or fear, but raw lust at how hot they were together.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I gave them a few moments, then joined in from the other side, saying, "Welcome home." I wrapped my arms around them, leaned in to Marta's ear, and whispered, "Gently rub or scratch at the base of her horns, it's one of her instant on buttons." I moved my lips and nibbled at her ear, smiling as she arched into Talia with an excited sigh.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta reached up and scratched lightly at the base of Talia's right horn, bringing a startled gasp from her. I gave her ear another nip and whispered, "Go for it," before backing away and smiling and nodding at Talia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia slid her hands up under Marta's shirt and squeezed her ass. Marta tugged at Talia's top as they stumbled toward the bedroom. I followed, picking up various bits of clothing as they were shed along the way. They were locked together on the bed when I dropped the spare bits on the floor. My clothes followed in a rush as their moans and motions brought me to a fever pitch. I slid onto an empty spot on the bed, rubbing myself slowly as I watched.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It as so hot that I screamed in climax almost at the same instant they did. I lay back in the after glow and watched as they held each other and lay catching their breath. Drifting between awake and drowsing, I almost missed the look in their eyes as they stared over at me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An instant later Talia grabbed my hand and Marta my thigh, dragging me to the center of the bed before they both set upon me. There were plenty of delicious female parts to suck, lick, kiss, and fondle as they worked me over. Moments later I had the most mind shattering orgasm of my life, drifting close to passing out as I howled in climax.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We fell back in a tangle, none of us wanting to let go of each other. For a long time the only sounds were labored breathing slowing, fingers sliding slowly over cooling skin, and soft kissing sounds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We stayed tangled together for a long time until Marta's stomach rumbled. She laughed and said, "I want more, but I better eat." Her face was red and her eyes downcast as she said, "I have this weird thing where I can pass out if I forget to eat for too long, and I've already skipped a meal today."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia softly said, "We have plenty of time," before giving Marta's ear a quick nip and her clit a light touch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Salome's Pizza is really good. I ordered in last night. It's not far, so we could walk there or order for here," I added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm too comfortable to want to get dressed, let alone walk anywhere," Marta said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I rolled out of bed, placed the order, then slid back into the pile, only moving when the doorbell rang. Marta's shirt was the quickest to find, so I pulled it over my head and ran for the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The food was hot, delicious, and just what we needed. Somehow they had negotiated beer delivery as part of their services. The Brushwick Brewery ale slide down as a welcome addition to the excellent pizza. We ate in bed, naked, licking any dropped bits off each other.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Conversation turned to the loft space as we ate. Talia was as willing as I was to accept Marta's ideas. In turn, she said she had some modeling software from scene design classes that would help her show us what she was thinking, but it would take a few days to get it all ready.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After eating we made long, slow love into the night, with each of us being the center of attention at least once. Late in the evening we drifted into deep sleep, worn to a pleasant tiredness by our activities.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta left after we had breakfast to withdraw from Davisson. Talia headed off to get her a job at the Coventry Market, and I sat, sipping coffee, and working on how to tell my parents I had dropped out. I was no closer, several hours later, when Detective Bishop called with another crime. Once again Polina was sent to pick me up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We rolled up to a four flat in the Sunny Hill neighborhood in the borough of Bragaza. The body was in the left side upper flat, cowering between the bed and the wall, his face pulled back in a rictus of terror. Scanning only showed the attack, late Thursday night, with no one else in the apartment. It was one of the Yelgezeth demonics. It had slid in when the man opened the door for a pizza delivery. The trail went cold outside the building. Enough people had passed nearby to erase the residual trail that I might have detected.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were almost at the precinct before Polina spoke, "Are you doing ok, after last week?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mostly, I guess. Are you? Have there been many, uh, civilian, human, whatever we call them, deaths from Section 13 actions in the past?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am, but I wasn't the one who, well, had to take the shot. Maybe five civilian deaths, and yes, 'civilian' is the preferred term, in the four years I've been with the group. Most have been unintentional, caused by the target lashing out when we were dealing with it. Last week was the first attack by a non-veiler I know of."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are there any civilian groups that would have any reason to provoke the kind of action we saw last week?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't really know. There are countless conspiracy theories running wild, but nothing with evidence to back it up." We pulled into the parking area under police plaza as she finished. I started to get out until I noticed her chewing on her lip. She slowly said, "I trust you, though I'm not sure why. I also trust Aragon and Bishop, but something's not right in Section 13. I can't point to anything, but there's a feeling of wrongness. It's been getting worse over the past year. I think it contributed to the loss of the last Strange, but, again, I have nothing concrete to point to. Just watch out, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will, and thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was getting late when I stepped into the stairs to Leia's apartment. I waited, knowing she would get some type of alert that I was there. My phone chirped as a message arrived, saying, "Go on up. I'll join you in a few minutes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia found me sitting in the chair, staring at the loft building. "I have the additional RFIDs. Also, use this to call me." She tossed a black phone toward me. Startled, I just managed to catch it before it hit the floor. "You could have let it hit. It's mil-spec in terms of shock and water. It's also virtually untraceable and untappable, with a built in defense group level scrambler. The GPS can be turned off and the phone only pings towers when you are using it. This way no one can tell how often we communicate."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very cool! Should I use this for everything, or only calling you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd say everything. I can show you how to clone what's on your phone into it and set it so it looks identical to what your carrier supplied."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Any chance you can get a few more for my roommates?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It will take a few days, but I can." She spun her laptop so I could see it, pulled cables out, and hooked up the phones. "I'll give you a memory stick with this software on it. That way you can do this for anyone else you need to support. Run it from the memory stick, it's been written to leave no traces behind on the system running it. How many phones would you like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I counted silently, Marta, Talia, my mom, Natasha, Aragon, and Polina, then answered, "Six more would be great." I paused and watched her work, then asked, "I'm good with computers, but, could you write down the steps to clone phones? I don't think I can remember all the things you're doing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure." It took a few more minutes for her to finish and several more while she wrote out instructions, then she set the laptop aside and handed me the phones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is it a coincidence that you look a lot like Alucinia Cassaveras?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia stared out the window for a long time. "I'm answering this because you know the need for secrets. It's no coincidence."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aren't you worried about someone figuring it out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd deny it. I'm sure there are ways to crack through all the protections, but I'd be gone before they could find me." She got up and started to pace in the small space. "I hated it, the money, the expectations, the society shit that my family sucked down as they begged for scraps from my uncle's fortunes. I started working here in high school, slipping out, disguising myself, and telling old man Eggstrom to use this name and pay me in cash. When he got too sick to work, I arranged to slowly buy this place from him. Then my uncle died and I was chosen as his only heir. Life got very ugly after that. Everyone came at me with their lawyers and sob stories, claiming more right to the estate than I had. My family was the worst."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I couldn't fake my death, that would have played right into their desires," she continued. "Instead, I dropped out of sight. There is a small team of management and legal consultants that run the empire for me. One of the things I was never taught was how to run something this large. You know, the worst of it is, I hate having the fucking money. Everyone wants it but me. My uncle's empire actually does enough good that it is better to keep it going than it would be to split it up in inheritance battles."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know why he chose you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I liked him. Sometimes I would visit him, quietly, so no one would know. I'd talk about this place and my dreams. Near the end, he said that's what he loved about me, that I would visit and not beg for money, or spin stories of how hard my life was. I didn't know until after his death that he left me the empire because of that. There was a short letter with the will, asking me to make him proud. I miss him and wish I'd asked what he would have wanted me to do," Talia answered, tears silently falling as she finished. She shook her head, trying to stop them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hugged her, without thinking about it. At first she stiffened, I was about to release her when I felt her start to relax. "Maybe there are clues in what you talked about other times. Do you remember anything?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He was kind to me, not like my family. We talked about self-sufficiency..." her voice trailed off for a few moments, then resumed, "He said a couple of times that equal opportunity was a lie. He hated how so many people failed because the system was against them. Come with me, I need to look at something." She rose and hurried through the door. We went down to the tunnels, where she opened a door I hadn't seen before. Inside was an enormous room, filled with humming equipment. A large desk held a semi-circle of monitors, behind a keyboard. She dropped into the only chair, worn and held together with silver tape.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her hands flew over the keyboard, calling up window after window of reports, until she sat back in surprise. "That sly bastard," she said with wonder in her tone. "He was slipping anonymous funds to homeless shelters, food pantries, and legal defense groups." She leapt up, grabbed me in a hug, and said, "Thank you! Now I know what to do. Don't worry about the cost of the phones, or any renovations to the loft. Consider it payment for today's therapy session and what you do as the Strange."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My friends are asking questions," I started, hesitantly. "They are suspicious of free rent and the other largess you have already bestowed. If I go back with free loft renovation, they will really wonder."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I suppose I could meet them," Leia responded nervously. "Do you trust them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"With my life. Are you willing to let them know who you are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, but I need you to help me. For that, I am willing to try a little trust. I want you to do something in return, though. I want you to carefully scan everything the three of you are going to wear. Don't bring any electronics other than the secure phone and no jewelry, accessories, or anything that could conceal surveillance things."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, I think I can talk them into that. So, what is this place?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This? It's a paranoid conspiracy theory fanatic's wet dream. I can tap into almost any network system in the Meriksas through this. The government built a monitoring system to spy on us. I tapped it to spy on them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know, speaking of money, there is a way you could start moving yours around. Open an investment checking account with Rhea Management. Move your money into it, like changing banks, then we can set up secure, hidden, accounts that you can slowly siphon money into. The transfers can be made small enough that the tax guys won't get interested and you will soon have a section of untouchable cash," Leia added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is Rhea Management one of yours?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, it is."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you have contractors you trust? We're coming up with some ideas for the loft."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I do. Let me know, through the secure phones, when you need something, and I can arrange to have them come by."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I took the tunnels back to the apartment. Marta came in while I was staring at the transit authority trip planner and the schedules to go to my parents place. "You ok?" she asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have to tell my parents I dropped out. So, not really."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I have to tell mine sometime too. At least they don't live here. I didn't want to give up the scholarship, that's what my step-dad was the proudest of."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My mom will be cool but my dad doesn't want to know about the world I see. Then I have to tell him that I'm living in a cheap apartment with Talia. He'll want me to come home, but that would be far too complicated."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll get the same pressures. My mom will start up again, and I can't take that any more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could always tell her you're living in a polyamorous relationship with two other women."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And have her fly up here to save me from myself? I'll save that announcement for a special occasion, when I can see her reaction. How would your mom react?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good question. She's pretty open-minded, but it might be a bit much for her, too. I haven't told her about Talia and I yet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My phone rang as I finished speaking. My mom's voice said, "Could you come to my office? I need to talk." Her voice was tight, with a faint tremor underneath. I had only heard her this way once before, when there were mass killings at the museum. I was headed toward the door before she finished.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's wrong?" Marta asked, seeing my suddenly white and strained face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something's wrong at the museum. I need to go see my mom immediately. Could you let Talia know I'll call you both as soon as I know what's happening?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course," she said, hugging me close for a moment, "I love you, be careful." Minutes later I was in the High Street station, waiting impatiently for the C train to take me to the museum.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty-five minutes later I stepped off the train, onto the museum platform and walked rapidly to the museum entrance. Inside, I walked as fast as I could, without calling too much attention to myself, to mom's office. I stopped at the door, surveying the mess that had been her carefully arranged office. The search had been thorough and quick, with no concern for the mess it would leave. Mom was seated in her chair, dragged into the hallway, stunned. Museum security were inside, looking at various items. "What happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I was in the labs, with Chani, looking at that book I showed you a few weeks back. I needed a reference book and came up to get it." She grabbed my hand, "Let's get coffee."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We headed away from her office, then turned from the way to the cafeteria. "I don't know if I can trust anyone here." She led the way deeper into the museum, down a side passage, and out, into a small courtyard, surrounded by buildings. She looked around carefully before saying, "It's starting again. Penelope Andulasia, in vault inventory, was saying a body was taken out of the basements this morning. I'm surprised you weren't called."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't even hear about it. Did she know which precinct responded?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She didn't. We could ask her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I followed mom into the vaults and basements, past innumerable locked doors, until we stopped at a small office, marked "Inventory Control". Inside was a woman dressed in a vivid yellow tank top, dark blue jeans with huge bells, combat boots, and giant red glasses. She was thin, with a Central Meriksas cast to her features. Her hair was dyed violet, with orange streaks. She was pacing around the room, chewing on a pen, and talking into a headset microphone, "Ylena Harmon surveyed the stack of crates in the center of her lab, debating whether to start with the remains or the artifacts first. She picked up a pry bar and opened the crate of remains, slowly lifting out the wrapped bundle and placing it on the large work table. The body was well preserved by the dry tomb in which it had rested. 'Let's see what made you lame, shall we?' Ylena muttered to herself as she carefully rolled the body over." The woman jerked suddenly as she saw my mom and I in the doorway, "Oh, Ms. M.! Sorry, I didn't see you there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pen," mom answered. "This is my daughter Kilashandra. Shan, this is Penelope Andulasia. Shan's a detective with the police."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shan, you said? Pleased!" She leapt up and grabbed my hand. "Oh, wow!" her eyes opened wide and she wrapped her other hand around mine. "It's an honor, and a pleasure, and what should I call you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, Shan is fine. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are something more than, than, well, than us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shan's fine," I said again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's something called a Strange Attractor," my mom said at the same time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Penelope finally dropped my hand and looked back to my mom. "So, Ms. M. what brings you to my dark corner of the multi-verse?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you remember which precinct responded this morning?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They came from the Park station, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Does the Park station usually respond to museum troubles?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, usually we get officers from the 24th. Why?" mom asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You called the 24th to report the incident?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, but other officers responded. It was a bit odd. The museum calls on the police often, to protect various exhibits or shipments. Usually we see the same officers, but no one recognized the ones that came today," Penelope answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know where they went?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The entry area to the lowest levels. Donnie, um Mr. Rebeki, head of maintenance, found someone torn up in the hall and called it in. He was pretty shaken up, said it was like the last time, all those years ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Were you here for that?" my mom asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had just started an internship in the Middle Eastern section. It was a terrible time! Is it starting again? I don't think I can stay through another round of it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure this wasn't the same thing," I said, even though I didn't believe a word of it. Penelope apparently did, though, giving me a relieved smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks, Pen. I've been meaning to ask, why did you take this job after your internship? You were brilliant in the Middle-East department," my mom added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As long as the inventory is up to date, no one cares if I use the extra time to write. Plus I get to see all the items coming in. I use them to inspire me. Your Tuar't'zani queen has given me a few really good ones already!" She looked down for a moment, the said softly, "She's a hard one. Answers to her questions won't be what you expect."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I heard you narrating. Do you write the Archeologist books?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, yes, I do," she replied, face burning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Keep up the good work. I really enjoy them!" She brightened at my words. I waited until we were out of her area before saying, "What was that all about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pen can 'read' things, getting impressions and ideas about them. Every time I could check her impressions, they were perfect matches to the data."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should take a look at the area where the body was found. Do you know where she was talking about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was afraid you were going to ask that. I don't know if my keys will get us into those old areas, but we can try." Mom led the way deeper into the warren of hallways and rooms that made up the second sub-basement.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The keys weren't a problem, the police officers standing at the entry were. My badge made no difference to them. They kept insisting the captain ordered them to stop everyone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once we were out of earshot, I said, "Those are private security, not cops. Question is, whose? Is there another way into that section?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Probably, these levels are more like a maze than rooms and hallways. I have no idea of the layout, but Pen would."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Penelope led a twisting path through half lit rooms and dim corridors, explaining that few people ever came this far into the basements. "What's down here?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really old exhibit materials, artifacts, and items donated to the museum that hadn't been cataloged. I keep intending to start, but other tasks keep me busy," Penelope answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She led us to a narrow set of stairs down, near the far end of basement two. A faint tingling began to creep up my back as we went down. "What's in basement three?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Records from the time when the museum was built and first opened. There are also some really old exhibits from the same time. Items that records have been lost for. I have been updating the inventories when I have spare time, but have been doing basement two first."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is back that way?" I asked as I pointed off to the right, where the tingles wanted to pull me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The oldest items and the far wall of this level. You know, it's odd that this basement exists at all. The geological surveys didn't show any reason that this corner of the museum would need additional basements." I started off to the right. "The crime scene is this way," Penelope said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like to look back here first. I think there might be something important." Penelope started to object, shrugged, then led the way toward the back areas. I turned left at the last crossing passage and walked to the third door on the right. "Can we see in this one?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's odd," Penelope said as she slid a key into the lock. "This one isn't stiff at all. Most of the locks down here need quite a bit of work to open."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside, the room was cleared in the center, from the door to the far wall. Shelves had been pushed together, boxes and crates stacked high and off on the sides. I almost ran to the far wall. Something was behind it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Penelope came up beside me, playing her light over the surface. "This has been altered. Look, the bricks in the center don't look the same." She felt along the edges of the color variance, then said, What?" just as a brick slid back into the wall. It was followed by a click and then the section of newer looking bricks swung out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* adjust description based on Citadel of the Holy Sword - area is a copy of the older sections that contain treasures donated by a Cothloc Heirophant at the time the museum was being built */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The room was set up to look like... There were various artifacts placed where they would have been in the original structure. "What is this place?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd heard rumors of this," Penelope said. There was an exhibit on a Cothloc holy site right when the museum first opened. The uppermost area connected to the rest of the museum through a grand hallway and it was the most detailed of the first exhibits."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There were problems with it, from the first," mom took up the tale. "Visitors reported strange things drifting in the shadows. Others reported things going missing from their bags. Two guards were found dead, without a mark on them. All in the first weeks it was open. The museum board of the time had it closed up and isolated. Then they burned the plans that said where it was."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had been half listening as I wandered into the chamber. In the exact center was a well, going down twenty feet, with a circular stair around its edge. At the center of its floor was a hemisphere of glass, formed and shaped of various colors, all swirling within each other. Traces of power radiated from it, growing stronger as I walked down the stairs toward it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shan, what are you doing?" my mom's worried voice followed me into the shaft. I stopped where I could still see them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Holy gods! Demonic portal, sin of the Grand Inquisitor. Fuck, it's reaching for me," Penelope gasped out. She turned and ran from the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I could feel it, but not pulling at me. It resonated with my magic, feeding it, strengthening it and calling to it in waves of power. My hair raised as energy surged through me. It caressed me like a lover, delicious, soothing, and exhilarating. I started moving, wanting to get closer, when my mom's panicked, "Shan, please don't!" cut through the pull.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Reluctantly, I turned back and walked up the stairs. The energy bled from me, returning me to normal as I followed my mom through the hidden door. I closed it, memorizing its exact location and making sure I remembered the combination Penelope had used to open it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could feel it in my head," my mom was saying. "Like it wanted to tell me something, if I would just listen harder."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wanted to pull me in. It was all I could do to run from it," Penelope added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is it?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's no record of it," mom said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't read it through the pull of it. I'd say it is quite dangerous and they were right to wall it off. I'd like to get out of here, please," Penelope added as she started toward the storage room door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then who built the secret door and why?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No idea," mom said, following Penelope.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tagged along, reluctantly, as Penelope led the way back to a set of stairs. "These stairs come up in the back of the room where the body was found." I started forward, surprised when Penelope stayed where she was. "I don't want to see it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the top of the stairs I could see a bloody patch where the body had been. Two men in police uniforms stood ear the door to the room, staring out into the hall beyond. Crates and boxes crowded the room, except in a path from the stairs to the door. The nervous energy from the watching men completely obscured anything I might have gotten from the scene.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After a couple of minutes to take in the scene and the position of the blood, I returned to the others. "I couldn't tell much more from what I could see."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Penelope led the way back out of the storage levels. I tried to shove every turn and door into my memory so I could return to the hidden room later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pen, are you ok?" my mom asked once we were back at her office.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, I don't know. That was, weird. It was like the entire hidden room was an artifact. The images were so strong I couldn't think through them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If it won't cause too much stress, can you tell me what you meant by 'sin of the Grand Inquisitor'?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't even remember saying anything. Did I actually say that?" We nodded and she looked puzzled, "Usually, when I'm reminded, I can remember, but this time it's just gone. I could go back there, try again..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think that's a good idea," my mom and I said at the same time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You might be right. I'll see you tomorrow, Ms. M. I need to get out of here for a bit." She started gathering her things together.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You ok to get home?" mom asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I'm just off the B line in Brushwick. No real thought required to get there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mom, there's something I need to tell you. Can we find somewhere private, since your office is all torn up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can use my office. I'll leave the door so it will lock when you pull it closed,"  Penelope replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks," we both said. Penelope smiled and headed out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are dropping out of Davisson, aren't you?" my mom asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I figured you'd guess. I've been thinking about this and I don't want to be the reluctant heroine, running to catch up. I need to get out in front and meet it on my terms. What I don't know is how to tell dad. To that end, I need to know what might be so important about the Tuar't'zani queen and the book that was brought to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You've changed quite a bit recently. What happened? Was it something to do with the library break in that was all over the news?" I gave her an abbreviated version, leaving out the killing, the body in the floor, and down-playing my role. When I finished, she said, "Kilashandra, there's more, isn't there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is, but I, it's, I don't want you to hate me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have I ever hated you for something you've told me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I shook my head, "But this is really bad and..." She hugged me close and stroked my hair, like she had when I would come home from regular school in tears. After a few moments I said, "Ok," and told her everything. I was shaking as I finished.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh baby, I'm so sorry you had to do that." She held me and stroked my hair until the shaking stopped. Then she let go long enough to sit in Penelope's chair. She motioned for me to sit in her lap and wrapped her arms around me again. "Are you going to be ok? Is there anything I can do to help?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm mostly ok. It's getting easier with time and Talia is helping a lot, although, I think it will haunt me for a long time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Does this mean you are together now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," I replied after a long hesitation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are your thoughts on relationships with more than one partner?" I asked, face flaming.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She blushed bright red and looked at me for a while before answering, "It can work, but it takes very special people. There can be serious difficulties when they break up if everyone isn't mature." After another very long pause, she said, "Please never tell your father, but I was in one with another woman and two men just after university. It was the men that couldn't handle it, they couldn't figure out how not to be jealous, so we broke up. They were far more petulant and childish about everything than Erica and I were. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talia and I are in one with another woman I met at Davisson."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Another thing not to tell your father. I wish all three of you well. Erica and I are still great friends. I miss her as a lover, but I won't risk anything that would hurt your father. The men, well, they were complete dicks about it at the end. Where will you live? We haven't done anything with your room, but it would be awkward with your father."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's the other thing. Talia, Marta, and I have a cheap apartment in Brushwick, at Coventry Annex. We want to try making it on our own. I've got the police salary, Talia has income from the markets, and Marta is looking for something as well. It will also save on the awkwardness of keeping the police stuff, the Strange stuff, and my relationship uniqueness from dad."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Too true. I'll give your father what news he can handle. Will you still see us? I want to hear what is happening with you. Anything at all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course! I'd like to be able to ask for your advice as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anytime, you know that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you keep me up to date with what you find out about your office break-in? I'll talk to Detective Bishop about the basement weirdness. What type of security sweeps and checks are made? Are there routine security checks on the staff? What type of screening is used on temporary and new hires?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mom stared at me like she'd never seen me before, then said, "You're serious."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It will help us come up to speed faster."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We do a basic background check on all new hires. We don't do routine checks, this isn't a defense agency. I had thought our security sweeps were thorough, but that looks suspect now. You suspect an inside component, don't you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I nodded. "It would take time to find that old section and even more time to install such an elaborate secret door." I called Detective Bishop and filled her in on the events as I knew them. She responded that she would let me know if Section 13 got the green light to investigate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should get out of here, but I don't want to see my office."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll come with you and grab what you need. Then I should get back too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, this is certainly a gloomy room," Talia announced as she entered a few minutes later. "Whose dog died?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Marta was talking about how to tell her parents about Davisson and I got a call from my mom about a museum break-in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is she ok?" Talia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mostly. She's a bit on edge because they tore her office apart. There was a murder in the basement storage areas, but I don't know if Section 13 will get to investigate."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tell Talia about what you found," Marta said. I described the journey to the lower levels and the hidden area we found.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's something else I need to talk about," I said. "Both of you are worried about the cost of the apartment. The benefactor has agreed to meet and explain, however, there are a few odd conditions." I explained what I had been told. Talia was looking skeptical by the time I was done. "I know, this is the sign of a raving paranoid because the person in question is a raving paranoid. All I ask is you wait for the explanation, then decide how you feel."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia came into the loft a few minutes after I called her. She was white and there was a thin line of sweat near her hair line, although her voice was steady as she gave the others a basic explanation of her situation. "Shan says you are wondering why I'm being this generous. I need your help. I have information, but no context. I am hoping you have context with additional information. First off, a little background. Gladius Dei, an enforcement group, answering only to the Heirophant, has infiltrated various areas of governments and industry. For a long time there was a balance of infiltration and non-interference. Recently, several occurrences have disturbed this status quo. For example, what is the connection between the recent find of a Tuar't'zani queen, an old book delivered to the Museum of Natural History, a missing Nasazi artifact, an attempt on the special collections of the library, and the purchase of CyCore Games by Rani Corp? The occurrence of these events triggered the change."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Nasazi artifact is a memory enhancer. The special collections contain books dealing with the gates between worlds and magic. We think someone is looking for a gate and how to use it," Talia stated, after a few moments of hesitation. "I have no idea why CyCore Games would be of any interest."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Isn't there that new game you two were interested in? What was it, Realms of something?" Marta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Realms of the Hut. It deals with the multi-verse. They must think the game designers know something," Talia answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My mom was talking about the book a while ago. It is related to the Tuar't'zani queen and the civilization around Patrea. The museum already had a few problems with Cothloc representatives claiming it had been stolen from them. There's more though," I added and described what had happened with my mom. "Supposedly, all the plans for that area of the museum were destroyed. Leia, could you check and see if you can dig up clues to how the old exhibit would fit into the museum complex?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cothlocs, meaning Gladius Dei," Leia said. She briefly explained to the others what Gladius was. "I can poke around. They have to file with the city any time they change or add to the structures."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Marta and Talia looked at each other. "I know you think I'm paranoid, given what Shan told you when I agreed to meet." Leia said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you aren't paranoid if they really are out to get you," Talia finished the old saying.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Polina, uh, forensics tech Nadjah Polina, was talking about an odd feel to Section 13 lately. Something's changing police side as well," I added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did this help? Are you more comfortable with the offers after talking with Leia?" I asked, once she had gone. Talia and Marta nodded slowly. "Shall we head back to the apartment?" They nodded again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was almost to the loft stairs when my phone rang. "Mason," I answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mason, it's Detective Bishop. I was going to join my sisters for dinner tonight and wondered if you could come along. Olivia enjoyed talking with you the other day and would like to do so again. We really hope you can join us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How about eighteen hundred, at their place?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll be there," I answered as I hurried down the steps behind the others.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My phone pinged with a message as soon as we reached the apartment. The message was from my mom, calling from the museum, wanting to talk about a couple of artifacts from the Tuar't'zani. Ten minutes later I dashed onto the platform with just enough time to slide past the closing doors. Twenty-three minutes later I stepped off at the museum station.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her office was mostly put back together, although far less cluttered than I was used to. She started as soon as we exchanged hugs, "I don't know if this has anything to do with the Veil you speak of, but I can't let go of the oddities surrounding the Tuar't'zani. The queen is a true anomaly. I think that's what makes her of interest. I know almost nothing about the book. There is no way to verify the claim it was handed down from the Tuar't'zani queen, Tyan Hanan, like the deliverers claim. However, it is written in an archaic form of the Pratean script. I was going to take them to Pen and see what she would say and thought you might like to come along." Mom rose, pulling the book out of her desk along with a small sample bag, and headed for the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She led the way to the door marked "Inventory Control" and entered. "Ms. M. what brings you back down so soon?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mom set the book and the bag on the desk. "These, I need you to tell me anything you can about them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Penelope reached for the bag first, opening it and touching the metal piece inside. Her eyes drifted closed as she spoke, "Formed in an industrial furnace under incredible heat, then part of an airframe. No, a space frame. Heated and reheated through many uses. Designed to use the heat and force to become more dense. A bad crash, space frame all but destroyed by impact and explosions. Two women, only survivors. One with this embedded in her back, crippling her. No medical tools to remove it. Desert, hot, dry, empty except for a few that tried to help, not understanding what they had seen. Metal stayed with the woman, until her death. Child birth, excruciating pain from the metal and the child. Something handed down to the daughter." Her hands reached for the book, caressing its surface. "This, this was handed down, tinged with blood, scorched by the fires of the crash. Why she would have this book with her, isn't clear. This is a history, going back from before the crash, from a long way away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Penelope opened her eyes and asked, "Well? Anything interesting?" Mom passed her the hastily scribbled notes she had taken. "Ah, I remember now. The space-frame was a shuttle. There would have been a large ship for it to have come from. The women were on a scouting mission. I have no idea why this book was with them. Something went wrong while they were over the desert, flying from high, snow covered mountains. Mountains that had been carved out to house a large facility. Sorry, that's all I've got."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No wonder the Cothlocs want this buried," mom said. "This would be as disrupting to their teachings as the people from the gates."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you think they know what these actually are?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not to this level, no. I think they are going on the oddity of the Patrean script matching this book, found in a Tuar't'zani tomb. If this were to get out, they would go completely psycho."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Olivia was waiting for me at Ezra's. "Nikki isn't here yet, but you can go on up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Upstairs, her sister, Mira, introduced herself and offered wine. I took a glass and sat. We talked a bit about our interests as we waited.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Detective Bishop came in, we moved to the dining area. They served an excellent meal, but I could tell Nikki was distracted. Once we had a second round of drinks, Olivia suggested we move to the work room. Inside was an elaborate circle, inlaid in the floor, with the cardinal points marked by gems representing the four elements. A pentagram was inlaid in the circle. Its outline marked out with silver. She motioned Nikki into the center of the pentagram, then she started a low chant. Energy built quickly until it formed a turquoise bubble around Nikki.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mira placed candles at the points of the pentagram and lit them. They guttered and smoked, each sending up a different color smoke and flame. As Olivia finished chanting, the candle smoke wove itself into the bubble. "Nikki, you should be safe to talk now. The bubble will make sure any memory of the conversation is too scrambled for a mind prober to read.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shit, are there things that can do that? Pull memories from your head?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I believe so, yes," Mira answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We don't have the source materials to research that kind of thing, so we don't know what it would be," Olivia added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It might be a magic item, but it is more likely an innate skill. The magic required to read a mind is extremely complex and prone to errors," Mira said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's like trying to understand subtle meanings in a new language," Olivia said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wanted to meet here because we can talk without being overheard," Nikki said. "Things are changing at the precinct. I now have daily meetings with the captain and someone from the Commissioner's office. I've been told to keep you on a very tight leash. I have no idea what the Commissioner's Office is afraid of, but they are suddenly very concerned about oversight of Section 13."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When did it start?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Someone came in asking a lot of questions after the museum and library incidents, but it really got bad after you found that lair in Commodore's Row. Someone is very scared of a competent Strange. However we keep going, we'll need to maintain complete plausible deniability," Nikki answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you tell if it was because I found that lair, or because I demonstrated I can find things on my own?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My best guess is because you can function on your own, and very effectively. I've always wondered if the brass haven't been trying to hide something, using our group to direct the Stranges away from it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Detective," I started to say.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nikki, please, Shan. We are just a group of friends tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nikki, could Leia be right about her conspiracy theories?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, maybe." She turned a haunted gaze on me, "I don't want her to be right. What she thinks would be extremely dangerous to everyone aware of or connected to the Veil."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds like I kicked something with that last event, though." It was my turn to look embarrassed as I said, "I've been talking to Leia. She makes a lot of sense under the paranoia. She says she's seen a lot of scary communication through the net since the events at The Met and library. Then Polina mentioned she was getting an unpleasant vibe from Section 13 of late," I added slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She might be on to something. We always get the misfits, but some of the more recent ones don't seem to fit as well previous transfers. I trust Polina, Aragon, and Perri the most. Then there's the commissioner's representative. It feels like there's something crawling around in my head every time he looks at me. Shan, I want you to keep doing what you have been, but be extremely careful. They've threatened to have you locked up if you are caught going off on your own."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Speaking of, did we get a green light on the museum?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, the exact opposite. Under no circumstances are we to do anything related to that case. Now that I think about it, mentioning what you found seemed to increase the problems."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Will this shield completely protect Nikki?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm pretty sure, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is a bit more I'd like her thoughts on, but I don't want to endanger her by saying it. Nikki, are you willing to risk it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After a thoughtful pause she answered, "I am." I told her about the hidden room at the museum. "You need to get back in there, if you can do it safely. It might give us a clue about what is going on. That was all I had for this session. Do you have any more questions? If not, I suggest we stop here and plan another check-in, maybe next weekend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good by me," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Before we release the shield, we have two things for Shan," Olivia handed me a set of earings, shaped in a goat head with horns spreading out. Each one had a gem set in a circular setting between the horns. One gem was a sapphire, the other an amethyst. "These are tuned to work with the colorizer spells in your other earings. The sapphire one will color majical spying items neon yellow. The amethyst one will color electronic devices a neon orange. They should reveal active and passive electronic devices, so you can sweep and clean around you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are there any peircers nearby? I'd like to wear these as soon as I can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's a really excellent one in the Mirror Souk. Have you been there yet?" I shook my head and Olivia continued, "You get there from the Arakov Market. Enter, look for a door on theright wall, near the back, and go down the long stairs. Tanis has her peircing shop near Mama Ayeda's shop, which is in the far reaches of the souk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone ready for the shield to come down?" Mira asked. Olivia started chanting, after we all nodded, as Mira gentle pinched off the candles. Once the energy bubble was gone, Olivia ended the chanting. Nikki looked around her and asked, "Everything go ok?" We all nodded assent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We sipped wine and talked like normal friends for a little while longer before I headed toward the market.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The market door opened onto a set of worn stone steps, descending to deep beneath the buildings above. They opened out into an enormous cavern, filled with jostling crowds, narrow stalls with twisting paths between them, and exotic and tantalizing aromas. Many in the crowd weren't of the world above. It took quite a lot of effort to not stare at the variety I saw before me. I followed one of the larger paths, past vendors of coffee, spices, strange fruits, and sizzling meats on sticks. Moving slowly, I wandered toward the far reaches, taking in the variety of stalls and shops. It reminded me of pictures of markets in the Middle East.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tanis wasn't what I expected. She was tall, about two meters, and thin. Her face was long and triangular, with hair sprouting from her head like it had a mind of its own. Her ears were long and sharply pointed, standing up and slightly out from her narrow face and contained several intricate rings and artwork. She had narrow, almond eyes, tilted up. Her mouth was wide, with generous lips and curved in a half-smile, as if everything amused her. Her face and arms were covered in swirling blackwork tatoos.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She wore a tan leather vest over a very short crop top, leaving her long midrif exposed. Her belly button had three peircings, arranged in a triangle. Each one had a short dangling chain attached with red, blue, and green gems set in them. Skin tight, low cut, laced up jeans hugged her narrow hips and a woven leather belt added an accent. Its buckle worked in a stylized spider pattern.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, come in, if you are going to," she said when I remained in the doorway. Her voice was low and sensuous, like warm maple syrup to the ears.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, hi. Olivia Bishop recommended I come see you. I would like to make an appointment to add a couple more ear piercings."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could take care of that now, if you have time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She led me to a chair and pulled my hair away from my ears. She examined the previous holes. "Let me guess, a mall piercing booth?" I nodded. "It's easy to tell. That stupid gun leaves tissue plugs in the ears and I bet they were infected a lot as they healed. I'm going to give you a much better experience. Now, where do you want them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Above the others, I guess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are you planning to wear in them?" I pulled out the new ones from Olivia. "May I suggest something?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok," I replied slowly. She turned me to face the mirror and held one of the new pieces up to my ear. She moved it around, showing me how they would sit at various points. It was quickly obvious that higher and closerto the edge of my ears would display them better. "Oh! I like that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought you might," she said with a warm smile. She prepared the areas, cleaned the posts on the pieces, and slid a piercing needle through, all while keeping up a conversation. The pain was sharp, bright, and over very quickly. "Now, wasn't that better than the gun thing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, yes it really was!" I thought for a few minutes as she was cleaning up. "What do you have in the way of hollow body jewelry?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know if I have any, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have an item I want to keep on me, most of the time, but not as permanant as an implant. It would be very handy if I could swap it out for a regular peice of jewelry when I didn't want it with me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can check my sources and see. There should be something. Otherwise, I can try and find someone who can do the metal work. What does it need to hold?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"An RFID, an RF Id chip for security, about 1.2 millimeters in diameter and about 12 milimeters long. On second thought, nevermind."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why not?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wouldn't work from inside a metal tube."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not all jewelry is metal. There are a few lines of bio-inert plastics available for people with alergies or times when metal can't be worn. I'll check around. You want me to call, text, or email when I know something?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Text, that way I'm sure to get it," I said as she gave me the total for my ears. I promised to send work her way as I headed out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Things just got a lot more interesting," I said as I walked into the apartment. I explained the conversation, the precautions taken, and the benefits of my new jewelry.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We need a strategy, boss, and we need to find out what's so important about the museum," Talia said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should form our own team and keep Section 13 out of as much as we can," Marta added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was about to reply when my phone rang. "I found the library information you wanted. Could you come over? What I want to show you needs a secure line," Leia's voice came through the phone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your apartment? Can I bring the others?" After a long pause Leia replied that I could.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Leia wants us to meet her at her place She found additional information on the museum secret area."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty minutes later I led the way up to Leia's apartment. It was a bit crowded, with all of us piled on her narrow bed. Leia set her laptop between us and opened a series of windows. "You were right, there isn't much, but what there was is quite interesting. The original exhibit was a burial chamber from under the Citadel of the Holy Sword. It was recreated in complete detail and included artifacts from the site. The exhibit spanned three levels and had access from the halls in the southeastern corner of the original building, using a long ramp, similar to the one in the original. According to the records, the museum closed off the ramp by framing it in and extending the floor over it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are there any other ways in, other than in the deep basements?" Marta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not according to the plans," Leia answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is there any mention of a 'Grand Inquisitor' or something called his sin?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her fingers flew as she scanned page after page of results, almost too quickly for me to follow. At last she stopped on a page. The grand inquisitor was the title given to the man charged with running the Cothloc Inquisition, running from 1150 to 1834. Leia pulled up additional pages, but there was little ,ore than listings of men who held the titles and what years the inquisition operated in various areas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Leia was about to quit when a paranormal conspiracy page loaded. She was about to dismiss it when Talia motioned her to wait. "Look at the last paragraphs," she said quietly.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Bernardo Gui, in his treatise entitled, The Holy Order of the Inquisition, references his travels with the Grand Inquisitor Ettienne Thierre and their frequent audiences with the Hierophant. If we look at the times of these visits and compare them to other events he notes, there is no way the pair could travel between the points in the time mentioned. Either Gui is fabricating the meetings with the Hierophant, or something else is responsible. There is one line in his account, deep in the final comments, about the Eye of the Inquisition and its role in the dispersal of the inquisitorial knowledge.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This author has been unable to find more than passing references to the Eye of the Inquisition, even after scouring every document available. One additional document places it at the Citadel of the Holy Sword, the headquarters of Gladius Dei, and the home base of the Grand Inquisitor. The inquisition was one of several activities associated with Gladius Dei. Gladius Dei is commanded by the hierophant's closest advisor, who was often the Grand Inquisitor, during the days of the inquisitions.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Access to the Citadel of the Holy Sword remains restricted, as it has for the history of that order. The only area available to the public is a small museum, on the main floor. This houses information on the history of the citadel, from its beginnings as the tomb of an early regional military commander, to the build up in the late 1100s as the seat of power for Gladius Dei.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Searches on the Citadel of the Holy Sword didn't bring up anything else out of the ordinary.There were plenty of outside photos, but no floor plans or interior shots. The museum hours were listed on a web page, but no other information was available.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I can get in by visiting my mom. I do it often enough it shouldn't raise any flags if I'm being watched."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you want us to come with you?" Yalia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It would look the most normal if I went alone. Probably Monday, during normal hours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sunday morning I tried Ivan's crepe recipe, deciding I needed a better pan by the time I was done. There were no complaints, and many compliments, even though all of them were torn and irregular.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the day passed quietly, just the three of us, hanging around the apartment. Late in the evening Marta called us over and showed us the preliminary ideas for the loft. She had sketched in the critical things such as small comode rooms, for privacy, a giant shower and soaking tub room, a main bedroom and a spare,and a library and work area for vudahn. The main area was left as a giant space. She had a few movable furniture cutouts to play with arrangements, but her plan left the area open and changeable. Taia and I made a couple of small suggestions, then I sent it to Leia for final approval.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Monday mid morning found me standing at the door to my mom's office, waiting for her to finish on the phone. "What brings you in today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need to see that display we were looking at last week." I glanced at the pendant from the Bishop sisters as I spoke. It remained clear. My mom started to speak when I pulled out the dark glasses and slipped them on. I shook my head and made a quiet sign while I scanned the room for electronic devices. "All clear. These detect surveilance devices. I wanted to be sure we weren't overheard."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Which exhibit? Oh, the room we found. Are you ok? Why this sudden worry about surveilance?" I explained the conversation I'd had with Nikki and her sisters about the police and Section 13. She looked more and more worried as I went on. "What are you going to do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Be very careful, try not to get caught, and figure out what they're so worried about me finding."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We'll need Pen'skeys again." I nodded as she led the way back to the deep levels.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I let her go in first, then followed behind. "Hey Ms. M. I could get to like having you visit," Pen said. "What do you need?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I motioned for them to be quiet while I did another sweep. Once the room came up clean I said, "Sorry about that. These sweep a room for surveilance. Could you let us borrow your keys and sketch out the way to the secret place we found?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll show you the way, but stay closer to the door. It's easier. So, you hear anything about the body?" I explained to her what I had told my mom. Her reaction was similar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slid to an abrupt stop as we rounded a corner deep in the basements. "Could we go in there?" I asked, pointing at a door away from where Pen wanted to take us. She looked puzzled, but led the way, unlocking the door with one of her many keys.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's wrong?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The area ahead is covered in surveilance. Much more sophisticated than elsewhere. I don't think I should be seen visiting that section again," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now what?" my mom asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We take something from here, make it look like this is why we came down, and we come up with a new plan," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Penelope was very quiet on the walk back to her office. She spoke once the office door closed, "There's one thing that is odd. If that was an exhibit, there had to be connections for lighting and ventilation." Her hands flew over the keys of her system, calling up diagrams and pictures. "I'm not sure how long this will take. I can call you when I'm done."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I climbed the ladder to the roof hatch. I had been curious to see what was up there since the first time Isaw the loft. An expanse of white membraneroof stretched away, broken by the skylights. The bridge was in front of me, a taller building was behind me. All around me were the sights and sounds of thecity. Hattmanan glittered like a jewel across the river. A small wind blew the sents of the river and the city to me. The hum and throb surrounded me. Deep bellow the subways clattered.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The energy crept into me slowly enough that I didn't realize it at first. I could feel it singing in my nerves after it built high enough.The books I had read as a child said magic power came from nature, but there was power here too. Power from the electricity singing in the wires, the hum of traffic, the people hurrying about their lives, from the very pulse and throb of the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Intuition prompted me to spin into the fighting katas Martin had shown me. The energy focused and coalesced instantly as I moved through the forms. Without thinking, I ran through the ones I knew, ending in a fighting crouch, and let the energy fly. A ball of violet ight flashed out into the night and arced down into the East River.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Once the shock faded, I raised my arms high and whooped for the pure joy of it. I ran to the ladder and dropped rapidly to the loft floor. Then I ran through the tunnels for the apartment, excitement carrying me along.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I arrived at Natasha's just after she did. She was just settling down after arriving when I knocked on her door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you get enough sleep?" Natasha asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, uh, sorry about class..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Were you at the library break-in? It's been all over the news and I recognized shots of some of your team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The news says there were deaths."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There were, but I can't talk about it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. I shouldn't have asked. I wanted to share some things I found from my time with Lana. Like you, there was no training. She just got dumped into it. After she died, I started asking questions and digging in old books. There was nothing to find in Moskava. When I came here, I started digging in rare book collections, where ever I could find them, and found a little bit. I spent most of today digging through old boxes until I found the notes I had made. There were references in the oldest books about people called the Monitors. Discussion of the Monitors appeared frequently in the really old documents, but became more scarce as the seventeen hundreds drew to a close. By the end of the eighteen hundreds, all mention of them is gone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, were they killed off, or did something else happen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing was very clear. I think some of them were hunted and others died without being able to recruit replacements. The last mention of them implied there was some type of headquarters in London, at least as late as the early 1800s."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did they do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think they helped the Stranges of their time. They collected information and covered up any spill-over into the world, kind of like the Ghost Precinct tries to do now. It's weird, though. You'd think something would have leaked out, some papers or something would land where it could be found. Even in the Ruskala Collective conspiracies always came to light eventually." We sat quietly for a while. I found myself drifting off when she said, "Should we go get some food?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd love to, but I promised my dad I would be home for dinner. He needs to talk about the library events, too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We could do it when you have more time. My family likes guests."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I smiled and added, "I found that out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could I ask you something?" I nodded. "I'd like to be involved again. I, well, I haven't felt as alive as I did this last Monday."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would like having your knowledge available. Something should be possible."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia and I took the subway to Talia's neighborhood. She led the way to a door I had only noticed after awakening, set in the back of the original Arakov Market.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The door opened onto a set of worn stone steps, descending to deep beneath the buildings above. They opened out into an enormous cavern, filled with jostling crowds, narrow stalls with twisting paths between them, and exotic and tantalizing aromas. "This is the local Mirror Souk, called so because it is a mirror of the immense Great Souk in Sphere." Talia led the way through one of the larger paths, past vendors of coffee, spices, strange fruits, and sizzling meats on sticks. She went slowly enough that I could almost take it all in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia walked up to a very old, dark skinned woman, sitting in a tiny stall, surrounded by baubles and trinkets. Few people stopped at her space, yet she was smiling as we walked up. She was dressed in worn, colorful skirts, layered, short to long, a frilly silk blouse of blazing scarlet, and an emerald green vest hanging open over the blouse. Her hair was bone white and tangled in tight curls. Her hands were long and bony, but still graceful in their movements.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia bowed to her and said, "Mama Ayeda, may we rent two tokens for Sphere?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You may rent one. The Strange gets her own. And may I saw, it's about damn time we had a Strange worthy of the title. You may think no one knows of you, young mistress, but many have heard of you since your first event," she replied, directly to me. She reached into a box and produced a large bronze medallion, hanging from rainbow silk ribbons and handed it to Talia. "That will be two of this area's dollars. Please wait while I find the right item for our Strange." She rose slowly to her feet and shuffled into an area behind the curtains at the back of her shop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several minutes passed before she returned with a small black velvet sack in her hand. "This is yours. I dare not touch it as it attunes itself to the first person to come in contact with it. If you would hold out your hand?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Reluctantly I held my hand out to her. She untied the sack and dumped a silver ring into my hand. It was exquisitely worked, with a skull face detailed down to the tiniest striations in the bone. Set into the eye sockets were tiny clear stones with traceries of purple fog slowly drifting in them. When I slipped it on my right middle finger, the purple fog began to swirl in complex eddies and flows, speeding up or slowing down with my thoughts. "There you are my dear. Now you young people should be on your way and let me have some peace. Remember to return the token when you get back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* should Shan and Talia get matching items? could be hut companion rings - would this level of interference occur? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, mama, and good day to you," Talia replied, bowing once more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I made motions to bow as well, but Mama Ayeda waved me to a stop. "It is not seemly that the web blessed bow to a humble gate keeper."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, Mama Ayeda," I answered, face flaming.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia led us to the end of the path, where a passage led deeper into the rock. It twisted around on itself and led down, ending in a chamber with a glowing, pulsing, swirling orb of multi-colored fog. Talia walked straight up to it and motioned toward it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Shan should take a heavy hit going through - disorientation, dizziness, etc. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stepped through first, experiencing a strange cold blast, then emerging into a small courtyard. It was surrounded by tall buildings, with a tiny fountain in the center. Directly across from where I emerged was a wall of windows, looking into a shop selling beverages of some kind. It was half filled with a wide variety of races. To my left was a single door in a wall with darkened windows, to my right a narrow passage led out into a swirling mass of beings, and behind me was a section of wall with a door to a bakery of some kind next to it. The sounds of hundreds of languages pounded my ears, while scents from exotic perfumes, food, spices, and other unknown items assaulted my nostrils. The tiny souk under the Arakov Market was nothing compared to what surrounded me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia came through, smiling as she took everything in. "I love the Souk, but it does take some getting used to. The first door in the end wall, to the left, leads to the Neutral Zone, the Asylum run bar. The door next to it leads to the Asylum itself. Beside us is Rishkahn's Bakery and across the way is Myrathium Kavla, a kind of coffee shop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kavla? Asylum?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kavla is like coffee, only much more complex of flavor and with a steadier buzz. The Asylum is based on the old definition, a place of refuge and sanctuary for those seeking a rest from the multi-verse. Would you like to sample kavla, venture into the Great Souk, or find a quiet room in the Asylum to get your bearings?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I started across the courtyard while saying,"Kavla, please." The shop was larger than it appeared through the windows, with a door across, opening into another section of the souk. Small clusters of chairs and tables were scattered around the room, about half of them filled. A short, feathered being lounged behind the counter, watching as I approached.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talia followed close behind and spoke something in a whistling, clicking language. A few moments later two large mugs of steaming dark brew was set on the counter. Talia pulled out a few coins, stamped from strangely colored metals, and set them on the counter. She led the way to a table looking out into the busy passage of the souk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Moments later the door opened, revealing a large man, dressed in leather armor. "May the asylum help you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We four seek refuge and quiet for a small portion of the day," Talia responded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Enter and be at peace." He stiffened as I walked through the door, then bowed low. "Pardon me, mistress, I believe the head of the asylum would wish to greet you, if that is ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Umm, ah, sure, that would be fine," I said. He conducted us to a rather grand chamber just off the hall the door had opened to. "Irishkah will be with you shortly. Please, enjoy the refreshments provided and rest in comfort."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The room had plush couches, a table spread with various foods, some recognizable, many not. There were bottles of liquids and a gently steaming samovar labeled with an unreadable tag, which Talia translated as 'kavla'. She motioned to the food and provided brief descriptions of the items she recognized. That left over half of them unknown.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had just settled down with a plate of some of the more adventurous items when the door opened. A stately woman entered, seeming to glide across the floor. She was average height and build, with thick, short hair that looked almost like feathers. Here eyes were red, her skin lightly tanned, and her face thin, angular, and exotic, beautiful, but not pretty. She was dressed in a simple robe of light blue, which revealed just enough to let her curves show while remaining modest. She bowed as she said, "Greetings, I am Irishkah and I am the madame of this place. Welcome to Sphere and the The Asylum. It is rare that a Strange Attractor comes to Sphere. May I ask what brings you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was told going through a gate would help as a strange."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talia wanted to show me something different, something more than the realm I'm from. Does that count?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's so much more to your destiny. Who is training you? Where is your support team?" Irishkah asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are none. I'd heard there was, once, long ago, but no more," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see. So you know nothing of your role in the multi-verse?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right, no one knows enough to tell me what I'm supposed to know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have someone that can explain, if you would like."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok if everyone hears this, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is up to you, as the Strange." Irishkah stepped out of the room for a few moments, then returned. "Aylytha will be here momentarily. She is a priestess of Ishra and is schooled in the ways of the Stranges."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider for later - maybe things happening earlier are to call/allow this to occur? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, I'll...Aaarrrg..." Terror chased its way up my spine, followed by chills and shakes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mason? Mason, what's going on?" Bishop's voice called from the phone, distant in my ears.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something big, something at the Salmanosom Museum. We need to get there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mason, what about the dogs?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They won't be anything when compared to the museum. Wasn't there an opening there tonight? An exhibit of dark magic art?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shit! Where are you? I'll send a cruiser." I told her. "Be outside, five minutes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Detective Bishop and the rest of the team were waiting outside the museum. "All the way up," I called as I climbed out of the car. When everyone turned, I opened the door and let Talia out, then followed them into the building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mason, take the lead," Bishop said as she motioned me to the front of the team. I set off at a fast pace, up the spiral ramp to the upper gallery areas. The miasma reached me first, a feeling of dread, despair, and doom. We rounded the last turn and ran into the first of the afflicted. They were staggering around, blank eyed and disoriented. Drool leaked from their mouths and their hands were curled into claws.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've heard of these things. They slip in through insecurities, then feed on the despair. They don't have real forms, just vague shadows from the energy they project. Darkness will weaken them," Talia's voice whispered from a shadow at my side.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do we get rid of them?" I whispered back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bishop, have you seen anything like this before?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, we haven't. Ideas?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I reached out and tried to see. Slowly the miasma solidified into tendrils reaching through a partially open door. Sculpted figures, in rough workmen's clothing, were lined up outside the door and the piece was captioned 'Waiting for the Employment Office'. "I think we need to close the door on the 'Employment Office' piece. First we need to reduce the light, something about being able to cast shadows makes it stronger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* gates were opened by a Nasazi ritual that spun out of control - they were trying to solve their rain crisis - the area is now referred to as the Place of Restless Spirits */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* An Incident: at an art thing, music thing on the roof of a museum where one of the pieces is bronze people waiting by a closed door - during the music portion of the event the door "opens" to let out some type of assimilator spirits, they will slide into their hosts, ride them for their energy, and break down some of their inhibitions - need to determine if inhibitions are violence, sex, other, but whatever they are, the things feed on the energy from the activities - Shan is there as a dancer for the school, who are involved in the reason for the event */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* incursions from beyond the veil are rising at the time Shan is Awakened. This is caused by someone finding old references to the disaster under the museum foundations and finding lost indications that an explosion didn't kill the workers, but something far different. Finder uses old tunnels to get close to the closed off areas, then punches through from the Central Park side and opening a path to the Hell Gate- something is prompting more incursions from the Void as well. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The sound of nails being pulled was followed by the sounds of sticky hinges. When Talia spun around we saw one of the doors was open. A staircase descended to a partially opened door. Around the stair was blackness. The door opened onto the long side of a garden courtyard. The area was fifteen feet across and thirty or so long. Carefully tended plants grew in two long beds around a central fountain. It was a simple fountain, a single jet of water cascading into the basin with a fresh, pleasant sound. High walled buildings surrounded us with windows masked by ornately carved wooden screens.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need a local weapons master that can provide her with talons and sword, she will hide sword in a long coat and talons in loose long sleeve items. Shan will favor blades and magic over guns - Martin Esterhaaz used to be a martial arts expert until a car accident damaged the nerves in his legs. Now he moves slowly and stiffly, however, he can still teach and has a side business creating high end weapons, mostly for collectors. Shan knows him through a mutual friend at Davisson and will become close to him. He will teach her how to use her weapons and provide her with the best ones he can create. Martin is a bit stooped, very thin, with a shaggy mohawk. He moves slowly, favoring his left hip, which was the most badly damaged */</p>
