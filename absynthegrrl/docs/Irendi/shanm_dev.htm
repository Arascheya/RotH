<p class="sectioncaption">Things to consider revising</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>


</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider Gate under the Museum of Natural History, access from Arakov Market to Gate would be NYC subway route A-C, museum is 81st street station and Arakov is W 4 St - consider a sub-tunnel for use by the Aware with a special connector to the actual Gate room.Gate could be accessed through museum by those in the know - see <a href="../../../tmp_images/NYC_Subway_hurricane_recovery_map_bw_Nov5pm.pdf">Subway map</a> for routing data</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider Chani and Herbert Kodetova are Monitors for the Yew Nork Gate. Chani is the director of the Museum of Natural History, Herbert is a specialist in the Zeltaaran culture</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider: 9th gate kind of thing with old books. Gladius Dei wants to close off this world, destroying the gate and killing any visitors. They want to retain their power and prevent the dilution of their beliefs by the truth of the multi-verse. The book shows the way to summon or find Ishra, in the gate dimension, to ask her to close down the gate connections to the world. The data was distributed through several copies of the book, but it is functional in its full form.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">CONSIDER: ghost precint was started as a joke, as a way to keep tabs on the Strange, and a way to white-wash Veil Events. As such, it was created from regular police, not people with an understanding of tactical actions. Shan and Talia are the closest from their FPS game experiences.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">CONSIDER: Shan will want to set them up with a secondary set of com gear, stuff that cannot be monitored, for when they are working and don't want interference - she will use Leia</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nikki will try and get tactical training for the team.She will be told there is no money in the budget for it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shan went to the high school for the arts, based on the <a href="http://laguardiahs.org/">Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School</a>. She was a poor student, so had to work very hard to bring her academics up prior to applying. She met Talia there. Shan was studying dance and Talia was studying technical theatre.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* after the first time ghost precinct kills a human where Shan is acting as tactical commander */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slipped in next to Talia when I got to her place. As I relaxed, it came back to me, the gun fire, the sounds of bullets hitting flesh, and the sound of the body hitting the floor. The shakes started small, just tremors in my hands, but built quickly until I was shivering in the bed. Talia wrapped herself around me, asking, "What is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, it's, I, in, in game we kill all the time, and that's fine, but they aren't real people. Tonight I had my team kill a man, a real, living, man. It's awful. I shouldn't have done that. Now I really am a monster."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was he safe? Would he have hurt you or the others if he hadn't been stopped?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not trying to make light of this, or say you are wrong for feeling bad. Just consider, humans can be mosters too. My mom and Mr. Hayes were talking about the books in that case. Any one of them could cause a great deal of unpleasantness in the wrong hands. Imagine what the entire set could do. The person you found was there to get those books or ones like them." It helped, not as much as she probably hoped, but it was a lot better than nothing.</p>
