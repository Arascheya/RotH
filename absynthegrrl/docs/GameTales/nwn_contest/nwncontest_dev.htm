<p class="sectioncaption">Things to remember throughout</p>
<p class="regtxt5">remember - run time min 20 minutes, max 40 minutes</p>

<p class="regtxt5">PC must feel in control of decision tree at all times</p>

<p class="regtxt5">NPCs should be interesting and evocative</p>

<p class="regtxt5">levels need to be interesting and contain interesting puzzles</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Things to consider revising</p>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>


</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Post-Magical Apocalypse</p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider second beginning cut scene of parts of the Magic War</p>

<p class="regtxt5">PC starts in the "village" near the ruins of the collapsed city - given choice to be Vassal or Other</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">need opening gambit to hook player - what happens in the struggling area to motivate the PC into some action? - see cut scene descriptions below</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Maritya of the Crows - seer of some ability</p>

<p class="regtxt5">orc twins - one is a brawler and the other a rogue, demented succubus healer, several scruffy humans - mostly commoners, mom - dies in first act</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the hovelites forage among the ruins of Tharaneta for various items to sell to the trader who comes to town every few months</p>

<p class="regtxt5">buried in the ruins is one of the artifacts used in the magic war that brought civilization to its knees. a wizard lord, Lady Ayrthane, comes looking for it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">artifact is one of the lesser items used, however it can give hints to the major one used by the Tharanetans in the war</p>

<p class="regtxt5">artifact can be found 3 ways - brute force searching, talking to the rest of the neighbors in hovelton, following or aligning with Lady A. The artifact is in a vault underneath an old tower near the center of the ruined city. It is protected by various traps and tricks, should have some type of thing that has to be solved to get into it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">areas needed - hovelton, several living area interiors, at least one section of City ruins, at least one underground area containing the vault and artifact, a section of terrain leading to the ruins where the PC lives - this is where Commander Elzeth has her troops and guards stationed and is where her residence tent can be found, Vault Access is 7 sections, each with dynamic door entrance and egress - destinations are set as each clue item is recovered - no clue and the egress exits to a random location in the city ruins above - many near local wild life looking for a meal</p>

<p class="regtxt5">in the city ruins need to place hungry random encounters - most are non-intelligent and feed off each other or visitors</p>

<p class="regtxt5">conflict points - Lady A retinue, if not avoided; should be a few things living in various parts of the city ruins, guardians(?) of the vault</p>

<p class="regtxt5">need to create friend of Misha item for trap in her entry</p>

<p class="regtxt5">need to think about some way of resolution if the PC decides to try and go head-to-head with Lady A - maybe a strategic withdrawal on her part if the PC manages to kill most of her retinue</p>

<p class="regtxt5">after reading mom's diary, the PC should get an approx map of the city, plus notes of what her mom knew about at the time of her death - zombie warrens, Vault entrance, other items - remember - some will have changed in 12 years</p>

<p class="regtxt5">scenario ends with PC recovering item and either presenting it to Lady Ayrthane or smuggling it back to the home cave</p>

<p class="regtxt5">NPCs - look at Gamasutra article on Characters in Game as a reminder of how to do this better</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Wizard Lord faction</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Lady Ayrthane</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Hard, cold as nails, - think Lady - it appears she seeks the Artifact for war, in truth she seeks it as protection from Shalmar, a greedy, blood-thirsty Lord to the south of her realm</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Mogron</p>

<p class="regtxt15">The perfect toady, but with a brain, Lady A respects him enough to listen if he raises a serious issue. Mogron is a capable wizard in his own right, just nowhere near as powerful as his lord. Mogron is a rather talkative sort when not in the presence of Lady A. He is a strong supporter because he knows the stakes.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Commander Elzeth</p>

<p class="regtxt15">The head of Lady A's forces and her most trusted retainer. Elzeth is having second thoughts about her Lord and her actions, particularly this quest to recover one of the great weapons from the cataclysm. A careful PC could influence her into removing the Perimeter Wards and possibly revealing Lady A's true purpose. Charisma is a good first step, however, charm and no-bulshit is a good second. Conversations need to be written so the changing of her position is not an immediately obvious option.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Others faction</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Mishana</p>

<p class="regtxt15">succubus, who has forgotten most of her background. She has an item which allows her to retain human shape. If it is stolen from her she will instantly revert. Sometimes she will revert to relax. While one of the test subjects she learned enough healing to make her valuable to the residents of hovelton. Mishana lives in a twisted tangle of the under tunnels, trying to feel a safety that doesn't exit</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Mishana knew of Tonie's sister and her name, but was instructed to keep it quiet until she gives the key to the PC. She can tell the PC about her mom and a bit about Dorotea.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Yantara</p>

<p class="regtxt15">the rogue orc twin - she is the brighter of the two</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Yintara</p>

<p class="regtxt15">the basher of the twins, she is always ready to rumble, particularly against outsiders</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Maritya</p>

<p class="regtxt15">crazy tya, she talks to her birds and mumbles in bits of vision. if she can be focused, she is actually a capable seer and can provide hints and clues to the purposes of Lady A and the exact location of the artifact. Maritya lives at the top of the ruined tower, up with her birds.</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Maritya fears and despises all Wizard Lords. She has forgotten that she knew Dorotea before everything started. She will council the PC to avoid any interactions with Wizard Lords for fear of enslavement or worse.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Barreth</p>

<p class="regtxt15">old now, Barreth knew the under-tunnels well in his youth. He serves a barely acceptable brew in his under-hovel establishment and can be prompted to talk with the incentive of a new item or a sack or two of truly fresh grain. He knows of a back way into the vault area and could be persuaded to reveal it for a cut of the non-Artifact items from the vault and a particularly good trinket as an up front payment. this back way has the final vault key stashed in a locked location.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Mom</p>

<p class="regtxt15">Born Tonie Ayrthane, she is a silent character, known only from her diaries and notes, she was the older sister of Lady Dorotea Ayrthane</p>

</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">Insertable Segments</p>

<p class="regtxt5">this should be the opening cut scene - once the PC spawns in. PC is next to Mishana, the demented succubus healer, she will talk to the PC after the cut scene - asking after mom - Mishana will be in human guise - don't want to panic PC until later...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lady Ayrthane: "Is this the place?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Frenzik: "Yes great lady."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lady A: "And these vermin? Do they pose a threat?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Frenzik: "Oh no great lady. They are the addled survivors and their bastard children, scuttling from shadow to shadow and digging garbage from the city in hopes of bettering themselves. They will scurry into their holes and stay there until we leave."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lady A: "Mogron, is it near and can you find it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mogron: "Yes mistress."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lady A: "Please pay our good Frenzik. His job is concluded."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mogron: blasts Frenzik with a flesh to stone spell, turning him into a statue</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lady A: "Take us to it, Mogron." group continues on into the main ruins</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mogron: "And the vermin?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lady A: "Leave them. Have Commander Elzeth set Perimeter Wards to prevent any from leaving."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A newer Cut scene <a href="http://gestalt.johnjsalerno.com/tutorial/in_g_cutscene_index.htm">tutorial</a> - using someone's custom code - rip into custom code and see what is in a cut scene. Also, run XP1 and watch cut scene, then rip into q1a_ scripts to see how Bioware coded it</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Solutions</p>

<p class="regtxt5">should have a couple of different solutions for various styles of play</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Spell based types - a magic related method of solving the Vault Access puzzle</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Fighting types - methods that don't require magic to access</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Puzzles</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Vault Access - Major puzzle</p>

<p class="regtxt9">seven gates of wisdom - need to solve seven sub-clues to get to the Vault - this sets 7 doors to the appropriate targets to lead to the Vault</p>

<p class="regtxt9">consider using the dynamic door code to change linking locations as parts of the Vault Access are solved.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">clues to the door setting pieces should be attainable by magic or by regular skills</p>

<p class="regtxt9">final piece to the Vault is a key of some form to open the final door and set it to the correct destination - 5 pillars around a trap-door, require the correct gems to be placed in them to open the door and reveal the Vault access</p>

<p class="regtxt5">debug tool - should allow display of Heartbeat counter and other critical variables</p>

<p class="regtxt5">heartbeat counter - see if this would be a way to count-down the time until Lady A finds the Artifact - if she does, return PC to their home, clear the doors, and play some type of animation that explains the artifact has been removed - each module heartbeat is 6 seconds so 10 of them would be about 1 minute - 39 minutes would be 390</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lab key - TAG: a_moms_key, RESREF: a_moms_key - required to activate link to lab - need to modify lab link to check for Key and Mom's Chest being unlocked, inside chest is a note, in the lab is a short journal - mom apologizing for dying and a brief explanation of what she was and what was being done just before the war, maybe a small hint about Ayrthane</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Mom's Note (in locked chest): I wish I could have been with you as you grew up, but life did not allow me to stay. I hope I bought you safety with this sacrifice. You are reading this because Mishana has given you the key to my chest. The key will also allow you to enter my lab. There are notes there that may help you understand what happened just before your birth. I love you very much, Mom - could consider making this a cut scene if have time/inclination</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lab diaries - one should briefly explain the artifact tests and the environment of the city, another the origin of the survivors - prisoners kept for testing, the third should explain a bit of mom's history and the fact she is Lady Ayrthane's older sister</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Lab Diary 1</p>

<p class="regtxt12">2 Tomahas 6700 - Felix Shelmak delivered the item to us today. It had been found in the Great Wastes, near the ruined city of Glangalath. Tamaris demands we drop all other research and focus on this one exclusively.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">22 Tomahas 6700 - It is a power amplifier, drawing on something unknown to function. Every spell we have sent through it emerges magnified over 100 fold.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">25 Tomahas 6700 - Dorotea has left to research this item at the great libraries of Formanought.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">27 Derethnish 6700 - Dorotea was only supposed to be gone a month. She still has not returned.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">2 Cenetash 6700 - The artifact has been mounted in a magical projector as Tamaris commanded. All that remains is testing.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">3 Cenetash 6700 - No time for tests, the war has come to us. Tamaris has moved the projector to her tower and ordered us to prepare potions and items for healing and battle.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">5 Cenetash 6700 - I hope Dorotea is safe in Formnought and not on the road to be caught by the troupes surrounding the city. Tamaris is charging the projector for use in a few hours.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Lab Diary 2</p>

<p class="regtxt12">8 Cenetash 6700 (maybe) - I don't know how I survived. Everyone else in the lab is dead. The city is dead. My family is dead. I only pray my sister, Dorotea, is still alive somewhere.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">9 Cenetash 6700 (?) - I found prison cells. Some of the prisoners are alive and tell tales of horrible experiments done on them by other research groups. I have freed them.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">10 Cenetash 6700 (?) - I have placed the artifact back into the Vault, along with all but one set of keys. The last set I have hidden in case my child or I have need of them sometime in the future.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">7 months later - my child was born healthy with no apparent mutation from the magical energies that laid waste to Mirishtahan, my city.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">2 years after the war - twelve Wizard Lords now rule the lands, each in their various holdings. They seek the old items of power, the ones used in the wars. A retainer came here, looking for artifacts. We killed him after learning of his task.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">6 years after the war - A Wizard Lord has come himself to search the city. He cannot be allowed to succeed. As I am the only one with enough training to oppose him, I am leaving to take care of this. Signed Tonie Ayrthane, last of the Mirishtahan Sisterhood of Research.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Lab Diary 3</p>

<p class="regtxt12"></p>

<p class="regtxt9">Mom's Note - in her chest in PC Living area cave</p>

<p class="regtxt12">My ring will take you to my rooms and my lab. This is the only way in now. I have left you notes I had hoped you would never need to use. I love you very much!</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Mom</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Mom's Note - in Ilithid Device in her living area</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Maybe Mishana has told you this already, however, if she hasn't...</p>

<p class="regtxt12">My sister, Dorotea, is still alive as I write this. She has become one of the Wizard Lords.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">I don't know what to think about this. The Wizard Lords are repressive, controlling, and brutal as a general rule. And Dorotea started life as a warm, friendly, and caring woman. No telling what happened during her climb to power.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">If you are here, it very likely means a Wizard Lord has returned. I have left a set of clues in my desk at the research rooms. There is a door out of my labs that go directly to my office. There is an artifact here, of great power, that would be very dangerous in the hands of the Wizard Lords. Please, get it from the Vault and bring it to the Testing Chamber in this lab. Place it in the center and destroy it, using the controllers around the ring. The destruction sequence is locked in the Vault with the artifact.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">There are some notes about the artifact in the bookshel to the left of the desk.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Mom</p>

<p class="regtxt12"></p>

<p class="regtxt9">Bread Crumb the First</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Only two people should be able to find this, my sister and my child.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Searching has brought you here. The others are not so easy. Vermin can be your friend. Watch for the odd one out for the next key. Remember what I tried to teach you, fighting is often not the best way.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Seven keys to the vault in all. You have found the first key. The second is deeper into this place.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The others are in places where my sister and I used to go.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The Inn of the Lecherous Priest, The Grand Library of Tharaneta, The Central Gardens, A Cave north of the West Road, and, I am almost embarrassed to say, The Dungeons of Desire. Not that it matters anymore, they are all in ruins now.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Within the Pool of Tears lies the final clues to the Vault.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Notes of Irena Katarya - Hut Hint, "Easter Egg"</p>

<p class="regtxt12">A woman once asked me, "Don't you want to settle down, raise a family, become a part of a community?"</p>

<p class="regtxt12">All I could think was, "Only in my worst nightmares. To be ground bound, stuck on some gods forsaken rock, would be a hell from which I would run screaming. I embraced the Hut of All Worlds, the Hut of Margla Fleshfeaster. I reveled in the knowledge that I could go anywhere and anywhen, and never have I regretted the price of admission."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Codex of Destruction</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Set the Orb of Enhancement in the center of the Rune Circle in the Lab. Set each of the Control Panels as follows:</p>

<p class="regtxt12"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">This should be more of a Treasure Hunt and less of a combat centric mod. Need to figure when Lady A. will be at each place and provide appropriate encounters</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After Dorotea has been in her room, the door will be unlocked, there is nothing in her room she is worried about. should there be something left over from before the war about her?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dorotea conversations</p>

<p class="regtxt9">in mom's rooms</p>

<p class="regtxt12">she will be neutral but not immediately hostile, unless greeted with hostility. an attack would be suicide.</p>

<p class="regtxt9"></p>

<p class="regtxt12"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider this approach - write the conversations for one character, then go back and add for a second - each one a different person - to try and break the blocks on multiple conversation paths</p>

<p class="regtxt5">add Nerris Shalmar and his team attempting to recover the item as well. there will be dead, among them the twins and others the PC will have known growing up - should be ambiguous about who has been killing them</p>

<p class="regtxt5">if can figure out freaking cut scenes, could come upon the twins being killed by Shalmar and a few others at random points of Shalmar and Ayrthane teams in battle</p>

<p class="regtxt5">place a few encounters with Shalmar forces in which the PC does need to fight. any Ayrthane teams will be neutral to the PC until attacked, Lady A will remain neutral, realizing a need to interact and bargain with the PC for the final Vault Key</p>

<p class="regtxt5">have Mom's Chest create the Vault Key on the PC to make sure they don't "forget" to grab it</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Module Description</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Life in the hovels around the ruined city of Tharaneta is hard, tedious, and relentless. Days are spent searching the ruined city for minor items to sell to the few traders brave enough to venture beyond the Wizard Lord holdings. Rumors hint that a major artifact, which laid waste to the city, resides somewhere in the ruins. No one in the hovels truly believes it until two Wizard Lords arrive.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">band name - maybe Dans Macabre - Laudanum Brigade</p>
