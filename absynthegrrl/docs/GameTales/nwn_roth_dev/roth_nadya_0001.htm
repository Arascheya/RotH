<p class="pagecaption">RotH - Nadya - Chapter 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A thin blonde man sat in a strange chair of black leather and silvery metal. In front of him was an older man with a rust colored beard, wearing a fancy gold and red robe. Next to him was a younger man in balck armor accented in red. The seated man spoke, "We have arrived. I trust you can handle this on your own from here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The robed man answered, "Yes, my lord Aztol. Ayrthane should pose no threat and the vermin, ha!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your orders, Lord Shalmar?" the armored man asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kill anyone you find."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What if they know something?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What could an Outsider know? Just kill them, commander."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And Ayrthane?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bring that bitch to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shalmar, I trust you remember that anything you find on the Hut, the Fleshfeaster, or Krystal comes immediately back to me," Aztol added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes lord, I remember," Shalmar responded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She realized she was dreaming when the images faded to the inside of a large tent. Two people were clustered around a small table, strewn with maps and dialgrams and a third entered from outside. The woman was tall, thin, dressed in elaborate silver armor, and stared at the maps with intense green eyes. The other was a medium height man, dressed in plain silver and blue armor, with a wide, stern face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Another armored woman burst through the tent flap and spoke, "My Lady, a giant metal spider appeared and is spewing massive numbers of Shalmar's troops."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Commander, disperse the troops. Tell them to make their way back home," the woman turned from the table and spoke to the intruder.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We only have a small force while the Spider Ship has brought Shalmar's army. We can't win with the force we have and I won't have our people killed needlessly. The three of us will stay, the rest need to save themselves."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What can we accomplish?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Vault Keys were hidden by my sister which gives us the advantage. Shalmar will have to blunder about until he finds them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The man finally spoke, "But the band of Outsiders living here will be anihilated."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, but there is no way we can protect them. They wouldn't bellieve us if we tried." The commander looked as if she might argue, but turned away instead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nadya, Nadya," a voice kept calling, distracting her from the people talking. Her eyes opened slowly, focused on Mishana, standing over her, frowning. "Nadya, there's a Wizard Lord in the city."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I dreamed them, just before you woke me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Them? Then there could be two? May the gods help us all! The one I saw was leading troops in through the South Entry. They set about killing anyone they came across, including Aaron and his family. Shana is finding everyone she can and getting them to the Refuge."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, not Aaron! He wouldn't hurt anyone! They're looking for a vault? What vault?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There was an artifact this city used in the Magic Wars. Some believe it is still in a vault somewhere below the city ruins."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Some believe? Does anyone know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There isn't time now. Your mom told me to give you this if wizards came here and to tell you it will provide answers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A key? What is it for?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is the key to the locked chest near her sarcophagus. I must go and get people to the sanctuary caverns. I'll bethere if you have any questions. Watch out for the troops, they're everywhere, heavily armed, and killing everyone they find."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait..." Nadya called as Mishana faded out in a flash of magic. She stood for a few moments, thinking about her mom and the last time she had seen her. It had been seven years since her death at the hands of a minor wizard lord. He had come to town, looking for artifacts of power and her mother had gone to stop him. Nadya had been left with Aaron and his family until she had grown old enough to live on her own. She had found the room she was in and the cave beneath, slowly filling it from the things she dug from the ruins. Keeping the pieces she liked and selling the rest to traders specializing in scavanged goods.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With a sigh, she turned to the complicated rope hoist that would take her down into the cave beneath her room. It moved silently on its well greased bearings, letting her off thirty feet below in a small cavern. On the wall farthest away was her mother's sarcophagus and a granite chest. The lock was complex and had resisted her many attempts over the years. Now she took the key from Mishana and slid it into the lock. I twist to the right and the lid swung open, revealing a small chamber behind thick walls. A small rolled up parchment sat on one edge and a silk bag rested nearby.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* add Dorotea and mom (Tonie) Ayrthane to Character lists */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* mom's note - chest with ring, next to sarcophagus */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* ring is transport to mom's rooms and labs - they are sealed off from the rest of the under-tunnels and have been from the time of the fall of the city */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If you are reading this, then Mishana has given you my key and the Wizard Lords are here.

I have left you my ring which will take you to my rooms and lab. I have left you notes I had hoped you would never need to use. Some are on a bookshelf in my bedroom and others are in my office in the Lab. I hope they are enough.


I love you very much!

Mom</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* mom's lab notes - in bookshelf near the strange device with data */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Maybe Mishana has told you this already, however, if she hasn't...

My sister, Dorotea, is still alive as I write this. She has become one of the Wizard Lords.

I don't know what to think about this. The Wizard Lords are repressive, controlling, and brutal as a general rule. And Dorotea started life as a warm, friendly, and caring woman. No telling what happened during her climb to power.

If you are here, it very likely means a Wizard Lord has returned. I have left a set of clues in my desk at the research rooms. There is a door out of my labs that go directly to my office. There is an artifact here, of great power, that would be very dangerous in the hands of the Wizard Lords. Please, get it from the Vault and bring it to the Testing Chamber in this lab. Place it in the center and destroy it, using the controllers around the ring. The destruction sequence is locked in the Vault with the artifact.

There are some notes about the artifact in the bookshelf to the left of the desk.
