<p class="pagecaption">Quest for Irena Katarya - Chapter 1</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa stood in the door of the inn, looking out over the same dusty track she had seen for her eighteen summers. To her right it faded away into the deeper forest of the upper valley where a few trappers and maybe a bandit or two lived. To her left it slipped through the tiny village of Stratmore-Upon-Comcrash, before winding down to the city of Miznyierash. The sun hung bloody over the tips of the Barrier Mountains and a hint of fall chill touched the air. A loud thunder-like boom sounded from near the village watch tower. In the late night air a huge gleaming spider had appeared just beyond the village. Men in black and orange swarmed down a ramp that dropped from its head. Shouted orders echoed around them. "Kill the men, gather the women and children."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lightning leapt from the strange weapons in their hands, making quick work of any that tried to oppose them. The sun had barely moved before the village women were rounded up and shoved into a huddled group at the foot of the ramp. The soldiers fell silent as a tall, blonde haired man stepped onto the ramp. At his side was a wizened old woman, stooped and leaning heavily on his arm. The woman raised a shaky hand and pointed at Alyssa and her mother. "Those two, dread lord. Together they are the key to crystal. Apart, they are nothing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And of the other?" The voice was cultured and cold, sending chills down my spine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kaltereth is not here, dread lord." The woman cowered slightly as she said this.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No matter, soon she shall be found. Kill the rest, burn the village, and bring these two to the guest chambers. They will tell me where crystal is very soon." He turned and helped the old woman back into the structure. Lightning flashed, death screams, and the smell of burned flesh followed Alyssa and her mother as they were shoved roughly up the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the top of the stairs the world shifted and blurred into an enormous throne room. The walls and floor were gold veined black marble, clear crystalline pillars supported the arching ceiling. Worked into its surface was blackness with a swirling spiral armed galaxy floating in it. At the end of the chamber a throne of fossilized bone perched on a five foot high dais. As Alyssa drew closer she could make out the shape of a dragon in the bones with the seat and backrest being formed of the pelvis, spine, and ribs. Various other bones formed the arm rests and the skull arched overhead, staring down at her as she approached. Two carven chairs flanked the throne on their own platforms three feet up from the main hall. One appeared to be deep green emerald and the other ruby.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Three figures sat in the chairs, sprawled in various forms of relaxation, and talking animatedly among themselves. They did not notice Alyssa as she crept closer. She stopped at the foot of the stairs to the dais. The woman in the bone throne noticed her and motioned her up to the platform. "Dreamwalker, welcome."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the top of the stairs the world spun and shifted to a ruined courtyard. Three figures sat on shattered columns and rubble around a large cauldron and fire. One sat in the shadows, face covered in darkness and a deep hood, one sat close to the fire, her face illuminated in flickering gold, and the third sat half in the shadows. This one motioned to Alyssa. "Come here girl. Warm yourself by our fire." Her voice was warm and inviting.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Be at peace girl. This is your dream. You are safe enough." The hooded figure whispered in a deeper echoing voice. Slowly Alyssa crossed to the fire.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who..who are you? Why are you in my dreams, and what do you want?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am Katya," the partially shadowed figure answered. "And these are my two sisters, Maranashma," she motioned to the hooded figure. "and Cenefalys." she motioned to the fully lit woman. "And you are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am Alyssa. What do you want?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We want nothing. We were having a quiet time together when you summoned us with your terror." Cenefalys answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have the gift I see. Like your grandmother before you." Katya added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Gift? Nightmares are a gift now? And what was that...thing...?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They are more than dreams, dreamwalker, as you well know. You serve yourself ill with this ridiculous deception," Katya warned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did you see? We cannot read your mind, young one." Maranashma whispered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A giant spider disgorging men, killing my village."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Perverter of Spiders. A powerful being, that. Beware of him. He will do you no good." Cenefalys replied. "Do you know what he wanted?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, although he was going on about  some crystal when he ordered my mother and I seized."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure he said 'a crystal'?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think it was 'crystal'..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is as we feared." Maranashma whispered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He seeks the warrior woman, and by extension, her companions." Katya continued.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are in danger young one. You, your village, and any who know you."Cenefalys added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Easy sister, you are scaring her. She is newly arrived at this level of Vision. But she is right Alyssa, there is great danger coming. Examine your Vision carefully, look for any clues of how this will unfold. That is the key to understanding and altering events," Katya soothed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It can be changed?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. No future is set until it has unfolded, although some are more determined than others. The Perverter of Spiders is quite determined so events involving this being will be harder to shift, but it is still possible."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What does this Perverter of Spiders want? Who is this warrior women and what does any of this have to do with me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Perverter wants a book the warrior woman, called Krystal, has seen. To that end he seeks her through her companion, Irena Katarya." Katya replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Irena? What do you know of Irena? Please, tell me!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And why is this important to you?" Katya asked in return.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Irena was from my village. She's one of the few who escaped and the only one to become an adventuress of great renown. I want to find her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You obsess over her, don't you?" Katya added. "Why is that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"All my life I've heard the tales of her. How she left my village and went off to find greatness."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you believe adventuring makes you great? Might not greatness be found in other ways?" Maranashma asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have no idea. I only know I am dying here. Soon I'll be expected to marry and then have children. I want more than that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But how do you know it is different anywhere else? People live, love, have children, and work to support each other. That is the way of things in most of the world. Hell, in most of the Multi-Verse." Katya added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But it's not what I want. There has to be more to life than that. If that's all there is maybe I should end myself and try the next phase of existence."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Suicide is always an option. Yet, what if the next phase is similar? What if most of the next realm is day to day existence as well? Have you considered that?" Katya replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe it is. I just know I have to get out of here. I have to see if there is more somewhere else. Surely the entire world can't be as dull as here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe not, but what will you do if it is?" Katya asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can still find Irena and talk to her. She'd talk to someone from her village, I know she would."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And if she's dead? What then?" Katya asked in return.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I continue adventuring and strive to become like her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure you know her well enough to do that? What if she isn't this "hero" you think she is?" Cenefalys asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She is."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can't know that. What if she has done monstrous things? Become a terrible being?" Maranashma asked from the shadows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And if she has? I won't know until I find her. Or find someone who knew her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you are that determined there are two people you should try and find. They were friends to Irena," Katya said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And they are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The first is Koria Dzahmahth, a demoness that became her friend," Cenefalys answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A demoness? Surely that can't be right..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, the certainty of youth. Do not be so certain of your knowledge, young madam. There may be many legends about Irena, the greatest of the Rogues and Shadowdancers, yet there is little real knowledge of her left," Katya warned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And the other, then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Darina Snowden, a resident of Stone Leigh, set at the doors to Ravenloft. Darina was her second friend," Maranashma replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where should I find these two?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At last you begin to understand. In the tales of the bards the adventurers already know the path and they are walking it. In reality, they may spend most of their lives seeking the adventure they crave. But you have heard of Irena from someone, maybe they know of her friends as well," Maranashma said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone in town knows of Irena. No one knows anything about where she is though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is the path of research and sages, the path of digging for the lost knowledge to find a thread to follow." Cenefalys added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"True..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Or there is the heading off into the unknown and hoping that somewhere else you may find a crumb or a clue to that which you seek. All of these are options for you to pursue. Although, you could ask your mother about Irena," Katya mentioned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And why should I do that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you ever talked to your mother about her life? It might surprise you. She wasn't always your mother and she wasn't always in this village," Katya asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She never talks about herself. I tried when I was little but she always deferred to my father. She left for a few years and then came back. That's all she's ever said."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you've never wondered if there was a reason she did that? Maybe you should ask her again rather than assume you know her. Give her a chance before you leave. She might surprise you," Katya said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess maybe I should."</p>

</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Early morning sunlight slipped down the wall and into Alyssa's eyes. Slowly she opened them, the last wisps of the dream remaining as a film across the room for a moment more. She rolled out of bed and dressed for the day. "Mom, mom, can I talk to you for a few minutes?" she called as she thundered down stairs and into the kitchen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Later, right now you're late for your duties as server. Now, grab those bowls and get them out to tables two three and eight. You know we're serving breakfast for the next hour." Alyssa grabbed the bowls and headed out into the common room. Her father held court behind the bar, dispensing early morning drinks and keeping old Elsias from falling off his stool. The rest of the village morning regulars were in their various places as well, some at the tables scattered around the room and a few tucked up to the bar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Morning Alyssa. Happy birthday," Roweana said as Alyssa slid her bowl a bowl in front of her. "Given any thought to my offer of a spot at the barracks? Your tracking skills make you a good catch."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Still thinking about it, Row."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Old Lorin barely grunted as she placed his bowl near his right and leaned down to kiss his head. "Morning grandfather."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Eh, oh, happy birthday Lyssa. How has your day been so far?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I overslept again, other than that, good." She moved around the table to hug her grandmother, "Morning Gran."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Morning dear." Alyssa started to place the last bowl in front of her grandmother when the main door opened and three large men in black and orange garb, exactly matching the uniforms the spider men had worn in her dreams, walked into the inn. The one in front crossed to her father at the bar while the other two headed for table ten. Some of the food slopped out as her hand started shaking. "Alyssa, go into the kitchen, quickly," her grandmother whispered sharply. She turned and walked rapidly back out of the main room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Any more orders, honey?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No mom, just some strangers talking to dad."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Traders?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. They're wearing military style gear in blacks and oranges."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"With black web and spider patches on the sleeves?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, how did you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tersa mentioned seeing a group dressed that way in Miznyierash last time she came through. Said they were polite enough unless they wanted something, then they were pure trouble. Apparently they are even more numerous down river, toward Frenlayish and Azkelon on the great central lake."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who are they allied with?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tersa didn't know for certain. Some new noble from an old family returning to ancestral lands was the common rumor. Did you check if they wanted anything?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Gran sent me back here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Guess your father will have to take care of it then. You wanted to ask me something earlier?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wanted to ask you about when you left the village, and about Irena..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lyss, I don't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mom, I had a dream, about the village and men like those who just came in. I'm scared, they killed everyone except for you and me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Honey, it's just a dream."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no it's not. I...I've had them before, just like gran, and things happen to people, just like in them. Oh gods, mom, I'm scared!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lyss, why didn't you tell us? Gran could have helped you!" Her mother pulled her into a close hug.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought they'd go away. They never amounted to much before. I saw Tevin cut himself, or Laura sprain her ankle, but never anything like this. These men, they want Irena, and their master thinks we can give her to him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her mom sighed heavily, "Go wake your sister, she'll need to cover for you. Have her send gran back in, she can cook for a while, won't kill her yet I suppose. Then I'll tell you about it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa ran up the stairs and skidded into the room she shared with her sister. "Anna, wake up, mom needs you," she called at the blonde head, three quarters buried under her blankets, on the bottom bunk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Go away, pest," The sleepy head mumbled as it turned toward the wall.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Seriously, mom needs you.Come on, you got to get up!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Blazing blue eyes stared out of a sleepy face as Anna rolled back over. "Damn it! You kept me awake half the night with your tossing and whimpering and now I have to get up? It's not right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry Anna."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, Yeah, give me a minute." Anna swung her long legs off the top bunk and shuddered at the cold wood of the floor. She pulled a long dress over her sleep tunic and staggered toward the stairs. "Well, you coming?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anna, you need to take Lyssa's shift."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why, are her legs broken?" Anna whined.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Gran Saw something, something bad, and Lyss needs to keep out of sight. Now go check on the common room and ask gran to come back here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, oh damn, sorry Lyss!" Anna was suddenly wide awake and focused. She took a moment to flip her hair into place then hurried through the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gran slipped into the kitchen before the door had a chance to close. "Yes, I can cook while you and Lyss talk. Anna and I can take care of it, you two go and talk. And Luci, might I recommend the forest patch where the good mushrooms grow?" Alyssa and her mother hurried out the back and up the track into the deeper forest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Five minutes quick walking brought them to a faint trail off to the left. Soon they were settled on dry moss and spongy needles under and ancient pine. For a long moment her mother stared out into the small clearing beyond. "I don't like to talk about that time in my life..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But mother..."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Hear me out. I don't like to talk about it because it was wonderful and horrible, and the horrible bits took years to forget," She stared up into the canopy of the tree over them and then began, "I was your age when it all started. Like you I was bored and restless, slipping away from the inn whenever I could to walk in the woods, slide into the barns with one cute boy or the other, normal stuff I guess. The only thing that kept me out of trouble was the women's wine gran gave me. One hot summer night I was on my way back to the inn, rather later than usual, and not looking forward to gran's switch. I had stopped for a moment to look up at the stars when a brilliant streak of light flashed across the sky from down river and toward the icy wastes of the Barrier Mountains."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"People said lights in the sky were omens, at the time I prayed it meant I would soon get out of Stratmore. Others say 'Beware what you ask of the gods, for they may grant it'. Those people are very right!"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I returned to the inn, got the switching I deserved, and went to bed, thinking little more on it. The next day passed without event and the feeling of change started to fade. By dusk I was ready to believe I had imagined it until I stepped out to cool down from the heat of the kitchen. Shadows moved on the road, the road we just came down. At first I thought it was bandits. This was before the Hell Gate Wars and there were more bandits in our woods then. I was going to slip back inside when I got a better look. Two figures were leaning on each other and staggering down the road. It could have been a trick, but I resolved to watch a bit longer."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"As they drew closer I could see it was two women, leaning on each other for support. One was rail thin and wiry. The other was dark skinned with the look of a soldier or swordswoman. Her face marked her as from the Lotus Empire as did her speech when she spoke, "We seek a healer. I have friends up the road, we were attacked by bandits." I looked at them closely in the light from the door. The thin woman was supporting the dark one. Her eyes watched everything with a predator's vigilance. The dark one looked drained and grey under her dark skin. They both had fine woolen blankets pulled close around themselves even though the night was warm."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I am shamed to say I hesitated for a very long time. It could have so easily been a trap. It wasn't until the dark one turned to walk into the village that I thawed and replied, "I am trained in healing. You may rest here while my companion takes me back to your friends."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I am afraid I am the only one that can understand your speech. I must return with you." They turned and lead the way back up the road to a place a little farther up the valley from here. A small pile of bodies brought me to a quick halt. "Over here, please," the dark one motioned. Just off the road were five others. Three of them had deep sword cuts, one, a winged creature of some unknown origin, had arrows in 'her' wings and chest. The last one sat against a tree mumbling to herself in a foreign language. They were all dressed in strange fabrics and odd patterns. Everything about them said strange, foreign, unknown except for the blood oozing from their wounds and the look of fatigue and pain on their faces."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I started with the most seriously injured, a man named Will. Then moved on to a woman named Kara, and then to a small, delicate woman named Lynn. Kyira was the winged one, she was called a Vamyr by the dark one. The dark one gave her name as Krystal and the name of the thin woman as Shandi."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Krystal?" Alyssa cried. "She is the one the black and orange leader wants."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh no. This is not good at all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is it, mom?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"It's in the tale. Soon you will know. The final woman was Irena, but something had happened to her that I couldn't fix. I tried all the head related healing I knew but she kept rocking and mumbling. In desperation I asked Krystal to translate. She looked at me and finally replied, 'She's saying the same thing over and over again, 'My name is Irena Katarya, I have red hair.' She should have come out of this by now, but she hasn't and Kara and I don't know how to help. Could we bring her to some place in town? And maybe find a barn or something to rest in?'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"'You can stay at our inn. I'm sure my mother would let you stay a night for nothing since you were attacked.' I had them follow me back and we settled them in the inn. Gran wasn't very happy about it at first but it got better when they started helping around the inn. As days turned into months they slowly learned enough to speak to us and began to settle in. Irena's recovery was the slowest of all. Among themselves they spoke of 'cyber crash' and 'brain burn'. Her actions and responses to the world around her were those of a toddler just learning how to function on her own."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"They were always a bit odd though. Most of them had to learn even the simplest animal or farming tasks. Only Krystal and Shandi seemed familiar with weapons. Evenings often found them sitting at the farthest corner table talking among themselves in the strange language I had first heard or talking silently with finger talking."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"And Shandi, she was scary. She could barely string words together yet she watched everything, and her reflexes were faster than anything I have ever seen. I saw her fight once when a bold group of bandits decided to try and raid the inn. Shandi killed most of with short daggers and her feet before most of us had time to grab weapons. And she seemed to love every minute of it, attacking with a savage joy that was terrifying to behold."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* this is the updated version */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">/* in this update Irena is transported to the Hut with the rest of the starting crew directly from Stratmore, rather than later. Luci and her friend go hunting Irena with Kara and the rest */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Irena remained child-like for almost a year, until the harvest time, when old Serina came to the village to trade for her winter supplies. She was in the common room, haggling with Tersa over items to send down river when Irena wandered over. No one paid her much attention since she often wandered about, staring at things that would momentarily catch her interest. She stayed near the table for a long time, staring at Serina's small stack of items, long enough that no one was watching her when she reached out and touched a small wand. It flung her back with a sizzling pop and flash of bright white light.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Serina leapt upward, casting her eyes about wildly, while Tersa rushed to Irena. Once Serina realized what had happened she hurried over next to Tersa and examined the downed girl. Slowly she sat up and looked around with clear eyes. "Where am I? What happened to Ghost Wind and why am I dressed like this?" It was the first intelligent statement she had made and it silenced everyone in the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">After a few minutes someone ran for Kara. Kara enetered the room and Irena flung herself at her. Questions boiled out of her in a strange language. Kara tried to answer them, but soon gave up until the flood slowed many minutes later. They slipped over to a corner table and ignored the rest of us staring at them while they conversed.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The next morning found Irena running through a strange series of slowed down fighting movements. From then on her recovery was miraculous. She rapidly picked up our language, daily chores, and everything else she could.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">By the following spring she was getting restless, heading out in the morning and wandering the woods and mountains, returning late at night. She worked enough to repay everyone for taking care of her and kept apologizing for how long she had burdened us.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">One spring day it all changed again. Irena was up at dawn, gathering eggs for the morning meals, when a loud gong echoed through the air. It startled all of us as it rang through the air everywhere in the village. Irena didn't come back with the eggs and when we went looking for her, she had vanished. Krystal and Shandi were nowhere to be found either. Kara, Lynn and Will were frantic with worry. A diligent search of the village revealed no additional clues to them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* end updates - need to more correctly integrate this */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Six months after I had found them on the road Irena began to show signs of recovery. Once she began to come back her ability to learn was amazing. She learned our language in weeks, learned how to cook from gran, care for horses from Lorin, and started to learn herbs and healing from me."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"For over a year it looked like they would stay in the village and we would have welcomed them. Yet, as Irena recovered she also grew restless, even more so than the others. She would disappear back into the valley, at first only for a few hours and by herself. Then it would be for longer and with Kara and sometimes Krystal. She always came back drained and still restless."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"In the fall of the year after their arrival, I followed Irena when she headed out. I thought I was being careful but Krys spotted me almost immediately. They weren't angry and invited me to come along. We hiked up the valley, up the slopes into the mountains, and then up above the tree line. Krys pointed out the clues she was following when I asked her. They were faint and faded from so long a time. Every once in a while she would point to one and show me how to tell if it was one she had planted recently or one of the original ones. They set a grueling pace and I was exhausted by the time we camped high up on the mountains that night. I hadn't expected to be out over night and had not brought much gear. Irena noticed and shared her bed with me."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"The second day we climbed over a high ridge and peered out over the frozen wastes capping the Barrier Mountains. It glittered white, cold, and foreboding in the late afternoon light. Shadows danced across it from high clouds scudding about in a breeze even higher than we were. 'Are you sure you can find it Krys?' Irena asked. 'Probably. Can you help?' 'No. Everything went off-line in the crash. I only hope it isn't too buried after a full year.' When I tried to ask what they were talking about they told me to wait and see."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Before I stepped out onto the ice Shandi pulled a small vial of ointment from her pack and pressed it into my hand. She motioned for me to wipe it on my face and on exposed skin. 'Stops burns.' was all she said. I followed her advice and handed the vial back to her. Then I followed the others out onto the white where sunlight burned my eyes. Krys moved slowly, testing the surface in front of her with a long pole before advancing. 'Luci, beware soft spot, they can be hundreds of feet deep and hidden under fresh snow or thin crusts of ice.' I slipped in even closer behind them as we headed toward a distant spire."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"By mid day we had inched our way over to the edge of the spire. Around it the ice had melted back in the summer heat to form deep fissures. Krys lead the way around to the left until she spotted a metallic gleaming coming from the depths. "Told you," she said to Irena." Shandi pulled the sword she had been wearing from her back and drove it into the ice quite a ways back from the edge. She tied a long length of rope around it, advanced to the edge of the ice, threw the rope over, grabbed it and slid down. Once she reached the metal item she braced herself and motioned for us to follow her down. Irena went next, Krystal motioned to me and when I didn't go right away, swung herself onto the rope, "Come on down if you want. We might be a while though." Then she slipped down to join the others. A few moments later I got up the courage to grab the rope and fumble my way down. It took me three times as long as any of them and when I arrived Shandi said, "Me show later.""</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Irena had moved along the metal surface we were on and was fiddling with something on it. "Shit, no power at all," she said as she slipped out of her pack. She reached into it and pulled out a long grey length of twine, reached behind her head and did something with the twine. When she took her hands away it stayed attached to her head. I edged back as she bent down and pushed the other end of it into a small hole in the metal. A few seconds later there was a small click and part of the surface swung up. She pulled the twine loose, packed it away in her pack again, and pulled out a long metal tube. She pressed something on it and a light spell erupted from it."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Irena shone the light down the dark hole and followed it in, climbing down out of sight. Krys followed after while Shandi stood where she was. "Me wait, go if want." Slowly I approached the dark opening. Peering in I saw a round metal room with a ladder down and two strange metal doors. One was open and random flashes of light told me that was the way Irena had gone. Moving slowly to avoid tripping in the semi-darkness I eased myself through the door and into another metal room. This one stopped my movement with the strangeness of it. Strange bits of metal and reflective material covered most of the walls. Krys spun at my startled gasp, revealing her own nervousness. 'Luci, are you ok?' I nodded and asked, 'What is this place?' 'This is the...ah...the magic that brought us here.' Irena replied as she spun around in the chair she was seated in."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Slowly what she said filtered through the fog, 'Ancient magic, this is Ancient magic isn't it? Are you Ancients, come back in this growing time of trouble? Blessed be the gods for sending you to us!' 'No, stop, hold on there. I don't know what you are talking about. We are travelers, that is all,' Irena broke in. 'We aren't Ancients. I've met one, and we are nothing like he was,' Krys added. The conversation went on for quite a while in that cold, dark metal room until they finally convinced me that Ancient magic was like regular magic, other people could learn it and use it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Krystal's seeing an Ancient is why the orange and black leader wants her then?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, and because she read a book of secrets while in the place where the Ancient lived."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you ever find out what was in the book that made it so important?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, no. They didn't talk much about it. It wasn't long after that when they left the village. Something about that place had Irena eager to go, and Kara as well once they told her that they hadn't been able to figure anything out about a 'Ghost Wind'."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is the horror that keeps you from talking about any of this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I'm getting to it. It came several years after they left. To resume the tale, they left the village in the spring, heading down river toward Frenlayish. I didn't see any of them again for years. A few rumors would come back about the exploits of Irena, but they were only fresher versions of the rumors you have heard as well. I tried to go back to just living in the village but I couldn't forget the strange things I'd seen and heard when Irena had been there."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"The next spring, about a year after they left, I borrowed Lorin's sword and set out to follow them. At first it was easy since they were a novelty wherever they had been. The trail led me down river to Azkelon and then on to Tzell on the coast. There the trail got colder. They had been seen hiring passage on a trade vessel, but no one remembered exactly which one other than they usually headed south toward the Isle of Serenity and the on to the Lotus Empire. When I sought similar passage I was stopped by the high cost. I tried to earn enough using my skills from working the inn, however none of the inns paid enough. It would have taken ten years or more to earn the coin I needed, so, in the end, I resorted to the same tactic Irena used. I stole what I needed from the local nobility."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Three months later I was back on my way. At each port I asked around with the trail growing colder as I reached the Isle of Serenity. In the smaller ports Irena and her friends were a novelty. In the larger port they weren't different enough to attract much interest, especially after Kyira started venturing off the ship late at night."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"At Misbahd, on the southern tip of the Isle of Serenity, I caught a bit of a break. A tavern keeper remembered Irena negotiating for a ship to the Cities of the Pearl, one of the southern caliphates of the Lotus Empire. Again I resorted to Irena's tricks to get the coin to follow her. Almost two years after I left Stratmore I arrived at Safaq and lost track of Irena. Several merchants and taverns remembered her and her odd friends, however, no one knew where they went after that. It was as if they had vanished entirely. I tried everything I could, including paying a high priced Seer to try and locate them. The only thing she said was, 'Outside the streams and in all streams, Old powers collide to fight upstarts in the place at the center of all.' It makes sense now but at the time it was of no help at all, and it had cost me almost all of one of my biggest thefts to date."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I could have returned here, but the call of adventure was still strong and the Lotus Empire was old and full of places of wealth and power. I joined an expedition to a group of ruins in the wastes between Safaq and Ta'am. We were set upon by raiders and I was the only one to escape with my life when a group of Empire soldiers happened upon the raid. I was offered a choice of joining up or paying for the costs of the rescue because they were certain we had been up to no good anyway."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"There are a lot of bad things you can say about the Lotus Empire, but the treatment of women isn't one of them. I rose quickly through the ranks as I proved I could think creatively on my feet. Five years after leaving home I was transferred to the Calipha's Royal Guard. Three years later I was the commander of the Royal Guard. And then came the Hell Gate Wars a year later."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I had seen and dealt death in the service of the Empire but nothing prepared me for the absolute brutality of the Hell Gate Wars. It started small, a village destroyed here, an oasis there. In every case the bodies were horribly mutilated and violated. We rode out in search of the cause. We found them, gave battle, and won at the cost of half my force. That was one of our better showings against the lesser demons and dark creatures the dark forces could summon."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"The Calipha's Seers worked to pierce the veils and help us fight more effectively, but it was so little against steadily growing force. The only hope appeared to be a band of adventurers who had stumbled across old prophecies and artifacts that would help in the fight. This is when I saw Irena again. I been in conference with the Calipha's Seers and the leaders of the Imperial Armies for most of the day when the curtain to our chambers was flung open. The power radiating from the figure at first convinced me it was the Calipha until I got a better look. Irena strode in, pulled up a cushion, and folded herself down on it. 'Luci, I almost didn't recognize you in that costume.'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'You will address her as Supreme Commander,' my aide replied coldly.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'Irena?' I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'Miss me?'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'I won't tell you again,' my aide said as she rose, hand on her sword.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'Dirayat, that is enough. We know each other enough for this familiarity. Now sit down.'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'Command sits well with you Supreme Commander,' Irena added pleasantly.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'What brings you here? I searched for you for years. Where have you been?'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'It's a long story and I look forward to telling it to you later. For now, let's just say learning enough to be able to help you.'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'And how could you possibly help us?' Barake, commander of the regular army, demanded.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'Do you always attack your friends when they seek to aid you?'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'Barake, everyone, this is Irena, an old friend of mine. Do me the courtesy of listening to her. You shame me with your demands.'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'I apologize, Supreme Commander. Please speak, Lady Irena,' Barake answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'My Seer has seen the coming storm, as, I am sure, has yours. I offer the use of my Seer to assist yours in the planning of any actions to be taken, I offer the use of myself and my companions in battle, and I offer the use of a fast transport device for use in coordinating with other groups. Ask your Seer if she hasn't already mentioned the dark uprisings happening in other lands that coincide with here.' When she had finished Irena waved toward the door and a tall redhead stepped into view. Intense blue eyes stared from a pale white face. An intricate tattoo adorned her throat and upper chest. 'This is my Seer, Angelique.'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'Our Seer has mentioned it. But what is this transport device you speak of?' Barake asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'It is better if I show you. Please, come with me.' Irena turned and walked back out the door. She didn't turn and walk down the passage, she just stepped through the door and vanished.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'It is safe. Your Seer can vouch for that,' Angelique said as she stepped through the door as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'Dassouse, is this truth?' I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'Yes, commander, you are in no danger from your friend.' I rose to cross to the door. Abruptly she continued, 'And the Fleshfeaster shall pass beyond and at the turning shall the keeper of the balance sit upon the dragon throne and rule the Fleshfeaster's domain.'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'Dassouse?'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'Your friend is more than she was when you met, commander. I would not anger her,' she said, looking at Barake. 'She is a force in this fight now, one that will help us take fewer losses in the battles ahead.' crossed to the door, and stepped through.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">For an instant it felt like I was falling from a great height and then I stepped out into a beautiful courtyard garden. A long bench sat next to one wall, doorways led into the buildings that surrounded the courtyard. Two long beds of low plants divided the center and small fountains played water into pools filling the area with a delicious moisture. Irena rose from a bench along the far wall and smiled, 'Welcome friends, to the Hut of Margla Fleshfeaster. Come, Angelique awaits us in the sitting room.' She led the way out a door in the wall across from where we were. Inside a worn stone stairway rose to a second floor and continued up to a third. Irena motioned us through the door on the first landing into a spacious sitting room. A large, low table sat near the center of the room. Comfortable pillows in muted patterns were scattered about it. Angelique was relaxing at the end of the table nearest to a balcony door. 'Sit and be welcome. Would you care for any refreshment?'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'No thank you,' I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'Let us begin then. First there are a couple of things I wish to say by way of brief introduction.'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'Balance Keeper,' Dassouse whispered.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'I'm getting to that. The multi-verse, the very fabric of all time and space, becomes unstable if any particular philosophy rises to a position of too much strength. This can be too much law, too much chaos, too much order, too much destruction. The dark forces have tipped this world far enough off balance that I am allowed to interfere. I am Irena Katarya, the woman Alucinia met outside her village years ago. I am also the balance keeper as your Seer has said. The Hut of the Fleshfeaster has its own legends but I will add that it is a place where powerful magics can be called to do the bidding of its owner. I am going to use some of those as we discuss the coming storm.'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Irena motioned with her hand and a multi-colored ball faded into view above the table. 'This is the world we inhabit. I don't care what the local beliefs are about its shape, for now, please just accept the image in front of you. Scattered across it are seven Hell Gates, in roughly symmetrical positions along lines of intense magical force.' At a wave of her hand seven tiny little black arches appeared on the sphere, interconnected by violet lines of light. 'As you can see there are seven additional nexes where the lines of energy meet. At these points are seven World Gates.' Seven purple arches appeared above the intersections. 'We won't be worrying about the World Gates for now. The dark forces have been unable to gain access to them. As you all seven gates need to be open for the greater demonic powers to enter this realm. Right now six are open.' Tiny red glows appeared in six of the arches.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'We are here, in Jakara,' as Irena motioned a small star appeared near one of the arches. She motioned again and the globe spread and flattened until we were looking down on a picture of the maps of the Lotus Empire. 'The Hell Gate is in the Galhai Wastes, set in a place of powerful and very old magic. The Hand of Azeloth, ruler of the dark forces, has his citadel near this gate. This is why the attacks on your borders have been so merciless.'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Irena motioned once again and a picture appeared in the air. It floated semi-transparent next to the map. Within the frame were pictures several adventurers in an almost even mix of males and females. 'These adventurers have come across artifacts and prophecies that provide a way to seal all seven Hell Gates and force the demonic beings back into the hells. Unfortunately they have not been able to find all the necessary items and we are running out of time. As a move of desperation several leaders near other gates recommend we launch an attack anyway and seal all but on of the gates. This plan has merit with a small twist. We need to seal all but two of the gates. If we seal every one but the one at The Hand's fortress he will be able to close his gate, enact several dark rituals, and reform all seven gates at new location and then fully open them before we can gather the last items for a permanent closure.'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">'What I propose is using my Hut to convene a war council to prepare and launch the distractionary battles these adventurers want. They will slip in to the five gates we select for sealing and use the time we have bought them to close those gates.'</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Over the next months we assembled the forces we had talked of in the Hut and launched the Hell Gate Wars as the attacks became known. To call the blood bath we endured a war would be a joke if so many hadn't bathed the world in their blood. I lost almost my entire force of elite troupes, each of them dear friends and trusted companions. Barake lost an equal percentage of hers. By the time it was over the gates had been sealed and the adventurers were heroes. The rest of us crept back to our homes and tried to pick up the shattered remains of our lives. At first some of us managed until the survivor guilt overwhelmed us.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I'd like to say I survived, but the truth is I didn't really. I went back to the palace, resigned, and took to the streets. I whored myself out for money and hoped each day that I would be killed for the meager coin I had. I lost track of time until I rose enough out of the haze of drugs and drink long enough to see the three thugs and the knives they were going to use on me. I was a warrior, I could have killed them all if I had cared. Instead I spread my arms wide and waited for the end.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">That's where your father found me. He charged into them, killed them all, and tried to help me. I fought and cursed him for interfering. He dragged me back to his lodgings and put me to bed. I slipped out while he slept. He brought me back and tied me to the bed until the worst of the drugs let loose of me. Then he slowly nursed me back to physical health.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">It took months to get me to where I would eat if he didn't force me. It took almost a year before he could leave me near anything sharp or leave me untied at night. Through most of it I scarcely saw him. Instead I saw my friends butchered again and again in front of my eyes. Those memories haunt me in the dark even now.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I have seen Irena twice more after those dark and bloody times. Once when you were born and once when Annalise was born. Both times she seemed no older than when I saw her in council during the wars. Whatever magics that Hut has it has kept her young, but not care free. It was in her eyes, an aura of age that I hadn't had time to notice so long ago.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa held her mother close as she shook with reaction. She took a corner of her sleeve and wiped away tears. "I'm sorry mother."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't be. Bad things happen, it's how we react that defines us. Remember, it's easy to be heroic when everything is going well." Luci was silent for a few moments, then asked, "This orange and black leader you saw, did he have violet eyes by chance?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...I'm not sure. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now that I've remembered those times, it brings to mind some things I overheard about Shandi. She was tortured and altered by a man who like to dress in orange and black and had violet eyes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her words seeped into Alyssa's mind and floated scraps of images loose from the dark recesses. She peered at them, willing them to focus. Slowly they began to arrange themselves in a mosaic. She was on the stairs, looking up at the man as he turned to enter the ship. Concentrating she willed her view closer until a glint of light revealed a deep violet color in the eyes as his face turned away. "Yes, yes I believe he might have. Do you think it might be the same man?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If it is, be very careful if you encounter him. He sounded like a madman with what he did to Shandi." Her mother looked thoughtful, "I should go ask gran what she saw. It might help determine what to do next. For now, I need to get back and I think you should stay with Laura today and tonight at least."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They carefully made our way back to the village, keeping watch for anything suspicious, both made nervous by the tale of death and danger. At the edge of the trees Alyssa slipped along the river until she came to the pens behind the Sannall home. She slipped up to the back door and knocked softly. "Ms. Sannall, is Laura home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's in the barn, helping with the spring young. Shouldn't you be helping your mom?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She told me to get lost for a while."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, alright, just don't distract Laura from her chores or I'll take a switch to you myself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa hurried over to the barn and let herself in through the small side door. Laura and her father were in one of the stalls to her left, feeding a tiny calf from an old leather flask. "Lyss, what are you doing here?" Laura called.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My mom threw me out for a while. Can I stay and help?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're almost done. You two can have some time to goof off, if that's what you want," Laura's father answered. He finished with the calf and stood slowly, "Damn knees. Haven't been the same this year. Oh well, you two going to plan grand adventures again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, dad. Not like they'll ever happen though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't tempt the gods young lady," her father warned. "Some of them have a nasty sense of humor."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you see the strangers this morning? They were wearing black and orange and I saw them go into the inn about breakfast time." Laura asked once her dad had left the barn.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I did," Alyssa replied slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And they gave my grandmom a bad enough vision that I had to leave."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And what about you, oh mighty seeress? Have you had any more warnings about me stubbing my toes?" Laura teased. "You did see something, didn't you?" she asked when she saw Alyssa's face pale. "What was it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was bad, Laur, really bad. I don't want to talk about it until my mom talks to gran. Maybe it was just a bad dream."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alright," Laura answered. "There's hay in the loft with our name on it, unless you'd like to take a walk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, the hay sounds better. My mom thinks I should stay out of sight until we know more, just in case."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is bad." Laura led the way up to the loft where they flopped down in the hay. Laura pillowed her head on Alyssa's shoulder and stared up at the beams. "Can I ask you something?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know you can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Has your mom talked to you about boys?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I got the talk about women's wine and how to stay safe, sure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I mean about finding one to settle down with. My mom's been after me all spring to stop spending time with you and start partner hunting. She says she wants grandchildren while she's young enough to appreciate them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not yet. I think she might have last summer if I hadn't been so adamant about getting out of here and adventuring. Once I started with that, she kept trying to talk me out of it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can go any time now, right? I mean it's your birthday and you are age of maturity now, same as me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could, yes. I'd like my mom to be ok with it though. I guess that's been slowing me down. And not knowing what to adventure for."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You always talk about Irena. Why not try to find her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alyssa, are you in here?" Lyssa's mom called from the barn floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Up here, mom!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few moments later Luci's head appeared above the hay. "May I join you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, mom. What did gran have to say?" Luci looked over at Laura and back at Alyssa. "It's ok with me if Laur hears, unless it will change something?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I guess I still forget how close the two of you are. Gran said she saw something like you did. It wasn't as clear but the result was the same. Those men are planning to stay for a while. They had your father rent them the big room for the next three weeks with an option to pay for longer at any time." Luci stopped and looked at the two laying together, "Gran and I think you need to go off on your adventure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I thought you didn't want me to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lyss, it's never that I wanted to stop you, it's just I hated the thought of worrying about you. I won't do to you what too many in this village try to do. I won't stop you from following a dream, any dream, be it a partner many wouldn't understand or a chance to see beyond this valley. With what you've seen you will have to leave sooner than I would have wanted."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What kind of sooner?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If gran's visions and yours are correct, you need to be headed out no later than the morning after tomorrow. To give us the best chance you need to leave tomorrow morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"To..tomorrow?" Laura asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could go with her, Laura. You are age of consent as well," Luci added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My mom would have cows."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She'll have cows anyway if she knows about you and Lyss."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..." Laura stammered through a face gone red.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't be silly girl. It's plain to see how happy you and my daughter are. Embrace joy when you can. The world is a dark and hard place all too often. I will tell you this place is one of the few where what you share is even an issue. Lyss, I can get your things together tonight and I can find Lorin's sword and add that to your pack."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can get my things together tonight. As long as I don't tell my mom until I'm leaving she won't try to keep me here," Laura commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'd come with me?" Alyssa asked. Laura leaned down and kissed her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll drop your stuff off here before first light and let everyone know what happened. Stay out of sight today."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will. Thanks mom." Luci climbed back down the ladder and out into the day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did she mean, best chance for the village?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Those strangers you saw this morning are scouts for someone that will destroy the village if he finds me here. That's what I dreamt last night. And gran confirmed it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've got to warn my mom!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Flames erupted in Alyssa's view of the barn, screams came from below where Laura and her family were being cut apart by beams of light. Alyssa grabbed Laura and pulled her back down, "No sweetie. If you warn them you'll all be killed." The images shifted again showing the two of them slipping out in the dark of night. The orange and black men left two days later and the spider ship didn't appear. "We need to leave tonight, without telling anyone else. We can get you gear from my mom and I have money, We can get more clothes and stuff in Frenlayish."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But my mom..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My mom can tell her once the strangers leave town. They're the key, if they know about me the village is doomed." They stayed snuggled together in the barn the rest of the day, talking of the great adventures they would have.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the darkest part of the night Alyssa crept down from the loft and slipped over to the inn. Laura followed silently behind. "Follow my exact movements, I know how to avoid the noisy parts of the floor and stairs."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok," Laura whispered softly back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa eased through the kitchen and up to the second floor. She skipped several steps on the stairs and hugged the right side of the corridor to her parent's room. She opened the door in a slow and steady pull, then walked along the left wall over to the bed. "Mom," she called softly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her mom's eyes snapped open, her hand flashed out from under her pillow, stopping with a dagger point inches from Alyssa's heart. Alyssa stood silently and waited while Laura hissed in surprise. "Lyss, what is it, honey?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We need to leave tonight. Something changed, I don't know exactly what, but if we leave now things will still work out ok. We need some simple gear for Laura though. Dagger, blankets, an extra bit of food."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And could you tell my mom I love her?" Laura added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I'll make sure she knows. Give me a few minutes to gather the items. Wait down in the kitchen, best if I'm the only one tromping around up here." Alyssa and Laura crept back down and waited. Several times Laura started to speak, then thought better and stopped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A long fifteen minutes later Luci came down the stairs with two well assembled packs. "There's enough food to  get you to Frenlayish and bedding good for most of these nights. You'll need to get better before the colder season. Lyss, Here is Lorin's sword. It has some enchantments on it, so don't trade it for a lesser weapon. There are daggers strapped to the packs, the best I could find in a hurry. Trade those up, they aren't anything special. Now you two be careful and come back some day, ok?" She hugged each girl tightly before swatting each one on the butt, "Now get the hell out of my inn."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We will. I love you so much, mom!" Alyssa replied. They slipped out into the night and crept up the valley, away from the inn. Once they were out of sight of the upper windows they slipped across the road, down behind the Erasmus place and along the edge of the forest until the village was behind them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fifteen minutes later Alyssa edged toward the road. Laura pulled her back and whispered, "Call me paranoid, but I think we should stay in the forest a bit longer." Alyssa shrugged and edged back into the trees. A few minutes later they came across a camp set up in a clearing right next to the road. An orange and black clad figure scanned the road from the village while a couple more lounged near a cluster of tents. Alyssa smiled at Laura and they edged silently past.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After another ten minutes Laura said softly, "Anyone ever tell you your mom is really scary? That thing with the dagger tonight, that was creepy!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, she's always done that. I learned early you don't touch her to wake her up. I thought it was because she was an inn keeper and had to protect against bandits. It's really because she was in the Hell gate Wars."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She was? Wow, that's really wonderful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not to hear her tell it. She told me what happened to her earlier today, when I asked her about Irena."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She was the Supreme Commander of the Lotus Empire Imperial Guards at the time of the war."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alyssa.."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, she really was. I know we've not always gotten along, but she has never lied about anything important. She said it about destroyed her though. By the end of the war she had seen so much tragedy and death that she wanted to die. She came here with my dad to try and forget about that time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Are you worried?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"About this? No, not really. The reality of it hasn't set in yet. Maybe by morning, when I realize we won't be home by nightfall. I'm really glad you came with me, Laur." Laura moved closer until they were walking down the edge of the road wrapped in each other's arms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And so we start our grand adventure, uh, what is our grand adventure anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had thought I'd look for Irena, but now, that seems like a needle in a barn full of hay stacks. Maybe we could be bandit hunters?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you any good with that sword, Lyss? I'm not good with daggers. They'd have to be really inexperienced bandits. Maybe we could hunt treasure?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everybody hunts treasure. I'm all for it, it's just with so many hunters, is there any left to be found?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This was so much easier back home in our stories. It all seemed so grand then. We'd venture forth and become the new heroes of the land."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We still can be Laur, heroes have to start somewhere, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shh, Lyss, what was that?" Laura suddenly hissed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What, I didn't hear...oh..." Alyssa stopped. Faint music filtered through the trees to their right. A puff of breeze brought the scent of wood smoke. "Want to take a look?" Alyssa whispered. Laura squeezed her hand and started forward carefully. She slipped a bit and a faint snap rose from the now broken branch under her feet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And what do we have here?" A voice asked from behind them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Why Andrus, I do believe it is two little lost ones. Are you hungry little lost ones?" A deeper voice asked from the shadows to their left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We don't want any trouble," Alyssa said bravely.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now that's a good thing. Neither do we, but you should come with us and warm yourselves. The night is chill and our fire warm."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What..what if we wanted to stay here?" Laura asked softly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why then we would let you stay of course. We want no trouble with the landed folk," the voice from behind answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're of the Wanderers then?" Laura asked, shrinking back against Alyssa. "My...my mother warned me about you. You'll steal us away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And where would we steal you from? You are already out here, equipped for a journey, and traveling at night. Maybe you're the bandits and we should hold onto our gold with both hands, lest you steal it from us," Andrus laughed. "Come or stay, it is no account to us, just know that the fire is warm and the night cold." Alyssa thought she could see his shadow draw back into the forest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait, we'd like to sit by the fire, right Laur?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, yeah...yes. That would be nice." Her hand was icy in Alyssa's grasp but her step was steady as they followed the first voice deeper into the forest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The music grew louder and soon the flicker of fire light was visible through the trees. "Might we know your names, that we might introduce you to our tribe? I am Daniel and you have met Andrus."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, I'm Laura and this is my friend Alyssa," Laura stammered out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome and well met then, ladies of the river woods." Daniel lead the way to the small clearing where several richly painted wagons were drawn up around a small fire. Musicians played on pipes, fiddles, and drums while several others whirled in a simple dance. A steaming pot of savory stew bubbled softly in a large black iron cauldron. Overhead shadows danced on the forest canopy. "I bring Alyssa and Laura from the forest and into the warmth of the fire this night," Daniel called as he settled near the fire. A chorus of welcomes were returned from the various figures.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa settled onto an empty spot on a log near the fire and stared into its depths. Laura settled next to her and scanned the gathering curiously. Her eyes were drawn to an old woman, seated on the steps to a wagon drawn deeper into the forest. It was impossible to tell her age from the faint glow of the pipe she was puffing on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lyss, I'll be right back," Laura said as she rose.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hmm, ok," Alyssa remained mesmerized by the fire.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come to keep old Yara company, youngling?" the woman asked as Laura drew near. "Do not worry for your friend, she is in no danger. It's merely a simple trick to keep her distracted while we talk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What, what do you want?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The world is a dangerous place, youngling, yet do not waste your terror on everything you encounter. You should believe in your strength. Your friend believes in it and relies on it to get herself through." Yara laughed at the look on Laura's face. "So, you do not believe Old Yara, do you youngling? That's fine, for now. I have seen the strength you possess, in time so shall you. My words will settle in your mind and return to you from time to time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are we to talk about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, good! Nary a quaver that time. We shall talk of the moon and the earth, the seen and the unseen, well not really, but when you get old you have to find the humor in everything or the aches and pains of the day will wear you away. Your friend is a seer and as a seer she is in a certain danger. You see once you realize you have the sight it becomes tempting to use it to solve all problems. Like a man with an axe believes everything needs to be chopped. You must balance her reliance on her gift."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How would you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am one as well, one who has suffered from what I speak of. There is a curious thing about the sight. It is clear as crystal for the small things, will I trip on the stairs, what is for dinner, that sort of thing, but as you try to use it for more important things it begins to muddy. The more important an event, the more seers are trying to see it. The more seers, the more murky the visions become, until the seer is tempted to strive harder and harder to pierce the veil. Many seers have become lost in their own visions, paralyzed by too much and yet not enough information. Your friend is at risk for she is a powerful one. The Hell gate Wars may be done, yet the dark forces gather in the shadows. Their power is on the rise again and they will make another bid for this realm. Once again the Hut of the Fleshfeaster shall be drawn into the coming storm, as will you and your friend." Yara raised a hand, "No, do not ask, for it is invisible in the fog of the storm. You may live, you may die, there are too many choices yet to have any certainty of anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What should you do? Help tether your friend to this realm. Do not let her drift away from it and that will give you both the best chance of living through the coming dark. Now, I have two things for you. The first is this. I have seen that your friend quests for Irena Katarya. To find Irena she must find the trail of her companions. There are several, Koria Dzahmahth, Darina Snowden of the Raven Gate, William the Hazelwood, and Kyira of the Winds. And the second is you will find a small blood red velvet bag in your pack. Your friend's mother placed it there when she gathered your traveling gear. It is from your aunt. Your mother was going to hide it from you. Your friend's mom saved it for you and has returned it to you. It is the key to your power. You may wish to have a look at it while I speak with your friend for a moment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Will I see you again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is likely. The paths of the Wanderers are many and varied, as are the paths of adventurers such as yourself. Go with the meager blessing of Old Yara on your head."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa seemed to shake herself as Laura eased herself down next to her. "I've just been..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's a seer here. I should go speak with her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's sitting on the steps of the wagon, over there," Laura pointed. "I was just talking to her." Alyssa squeezed Laura's shoulder as she stood and walked to the wagon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura watched for a moment then pulled her pack around in front of her. She pulled things out until she revealed the velvet bag. Her hands trembled slightly as she untied the draw string and pulled the bag open. Inside was a large platinum ring with intricate relief carvings of cobras worked around it. Set into the top was a clear gem, cut with seven facets and rounded on the top. The firelight caught and reflected through the gem revealing little dancing purple motes deep within it. She studied it closely before slipping it over the middle finger of her right hand. A flash of warmth and comfort pulsed through her and was gone before it fully registered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa strode toward the old woman, dropped to one knee, and bowed, "Greetings seer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Enough of that youngling. Old Yara warrants none of that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But the Lady of Mischief does."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Saw that did you? Well then, lest you disturb those around us, don't do it again. Now, come, sit with me and have some tea. The storm comes, and while there is much mischief to be had, I have none for you tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And for Laura?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"None for her either. The item from her aunt will provide enough all on its own."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What item?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So you don't see everything yet. That is good! Seeing is not always the answer. You must trust your heart as much as your vision in the times ahead. Your mother kept an item from Laura's aunt that her mother would have destroyed or hidden. It is of great importance to her, so be mindful of her needs during this journey as well as your own. You have a great friend there." Alyssa smiled fondly. "Good, you realize it. Too few do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What would you have from me Trickster?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why nothing youngling. Cause a little mischief, play a few tricks, and be forever labeled, it is such a hard life. I merely wanted to meet the woman your friend loves. Mark it down to curiosity on my part."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And are you satisfied?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Enough. Return to you friend now and be welcome at our fire."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Might I ask how the Lady of Mischief comes to travel with a band of Wanderers?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course you may ask."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you won't answer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It would be telling." Old Yara smiled, "I like the company. Now go, get some food, your friend would like your company." Alyssa rose and walked back to the fire.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Old Yara smiled to herself and retreated back into her wagon. A soft voice called from the shadows, "Well love, that seemed to go well enough."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It did at that my sweet, it did at that. Although I hadn't seen the key to Kaltereth's tower being involved."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No wonder visions shifted yesterday. Many have wondered where that went when she was seized. Now come here, I'm cold without you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa sank down next to Laura and found her staring at her right hand. "What's wrong with your hand?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, you're staring at it like it either hurts or you've never seen it before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm looking at my aunt's ring. Don't you see it?" Laura asked, looking up at Alyssa.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it looks like your hand to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's right here," Laura grabbed her hand and placed it on the ring. "Can you feel it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a moment there was a faint hint just beyond Alyssa's conscious sight and then it was gone. "No, well almost, for just a minute. Who was your aunt anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I didn't know I had one until Old Yara mentioned her. Her, can you see it now?" Laura pulled the ring off and held it in her hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura turned her hand to drop the ring into Alyssa's hand but when she tried the ring stuck to her palm. "That's odd."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It won't let go of me. I was trying to drop it in your hand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can you put it down?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura tried to put the ring back in the velvet pouch but it remained firmly attached to her hand. "No."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll go ask the seer. Maybe she can help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I think it's ok. Yara said this was the key to my power, so I don't think it's bad. Even if it is a bit creepy right now." She slipped it back on her finger and wrapped her arm around Alyssa's shoulders. They sat in silence for a while, enjoying the music and the dance. At last Laura rose, pulled a bowl from her pack, and ladelled out some of the stew. "I'm hungry," she replied to Alyssa's look. A few moments later Alyssa repeated her actions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the music began to die down they spread their blankets near the fire and slid in beside each other. No mention was made as the various Wanderers retreated to their own wagons. Soon the silence of the forest was broken only be random pops from the fading fire.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Morning dawned chill as many spring mornings are. The sun was just peeking over the trees as the camp awoke. Cold stew was slathered on thick slabs of bread. Laughter and joking flowed freely as the camp prepared to get underway. Daniel crossed to Laura and Alyssa where they sat packing their bedding. He handed them each a slice of the bread and said, "You're welcome to ride with us to Frenlayish with us if you wish. These forests aren't particularly dangerous, but company is always welcome."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They looked at each other and nodded. "We'd like that very much, thank you," Laura replied for them both.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good to have you along."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have to ask," Alyssa began, "All the stories say the Wanderers have no use for the landed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, but you aren't landed now, are you? Seems you fit with us better than your own at the moment, if, indeed, they ever were your own. Come, there's room in my wagon for you." He waited as they finished packing up and escorted them to the lead wagon. He opened the small door with a flourish and called to the woman within, "Miri, our guests will be traveling with us to Frenlayish."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come in, come in. Plenty of room for all. We can share a bottle of fine wine and pass the time while the horses eat up the road. I fear I don't remember which of you is which." Introductions were made as the caravan began to form up. Miri closed the bottom half of the door and latched the upper portion open. "It lets in some of the dust, but I find the view of the world going by quite comforting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Andrus moved to hitch horses to Yara's wagon once he had finished with his own. A young boy climbed onto the driving bench and sat waiting while the rest of the caravan formed up. At a motion from Daniel they started down a narrow track back toward the road.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The wagon rocked and bumped along without any of the sharp shocks and jarring Alyssa remembered from the inn's wagon on trips to Miznyierash. Slowly they relaxed into the thick pillows on the bed and chatted with Miri about life in the village and life on the road. True to her word, Miri reached into a latched cupboard and pulled out a dusty bottle of wine and three sturdy mugs. Soon they were sipping rich red wine and laughing at various jokes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Toward mid afternoon Daniel leaned down and tapped on the front window. Miri slid it open and tapped his leg. He leaned down, "I'm thinking we'll avoid going into Miznyierash tomorrow, too much orange and black men of the Tolaz family there these days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, dearest. I've no need of anything from those landers anyway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know of the orange and black clad men? Several had come to our village as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Some new lander, Aran Tolaz, is trying to carve out an empire for himself. He started in Azkelon, claimed he was descended from the Azkel-Tolaz family that had come from there and left for a while. At first he didn't amount to much but over the past years he's been creating a personal army of thugs. They go from place to place and bolster the local nobility at the expense of the working folk. It's undoing the position by deeds with the older position by birth principles, with the usual bad results for most people. We try to avoid them whenever we can. They'd like to see us bound to the land as they are, stifled and caged like the creatures they take as pets."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Conversation returned to lighter topics for the rest of the afternoon. When the sun began to sink beyond the mountains the caravan once again pulled off into a small clearing away from the road. This evening the fire was built smaller and there was no music. "The orange ones patrol the areas near Miznyierash these days. They have no love of us," Daniel explained to Laura and Alyssa. "Tonight we set watches, just in case any come to cause trouble."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would help, if you wish," Laura stated. Alyssa looked at her, startled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As would I," Alyssa added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, but tonight you may remain as guests. Please accept the hospitality of my wagon for the evening. Miri would appreciate your company." Mire smiled and nodded from near the stew pot.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The women retired to the wagons once the meal was over. The men followed them long enough to grab bedrolls and return to the clearing. "Tonight the men watch. Tomorrow night it is our turn. You may help out then," Miri explained. "Now, more wine and conversation, or do you wish to rest?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rest I think," Alyssa answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good. I am tired today myself." Miri pulled the pillows from the bed and turned down the thick covers. "There should be room enough for the three of us, if we don't mind being close."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Close is fine," Laura answered. She slid in next to the wall, pulled Alyssa close to her, and snuggled up tight. Miri slid in last and pulled the covers over them. Soon there was only the sound of breathing and the sounds from the forest outside.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside Laura's mind was quiet in a different way. She stood on a a low rise looking out across a barren waste. In the far distance a single mountain thrust up from the flat lands around it. It called to her in a song of promise, singing to her of knowledge and home.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">The next day was a repeat of the day before, up with the dawn, a quick breakfast, and then on the road.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Toward late morning the wagon began to bump and rock more than before. "The field roads around Miznyierash. Even the magic in the wagon springs can't completely smooth out the dips and hollows in these paths," Miri explained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An hour and a half alter they were back on the smoother road and remained there until they pulled off for the evening. Once again it was a quiet camp with a tiny fire. After the meal the men retired to the wagons, leaving the women standing at the fire. Miri began handing out watch placements to the women. When she reached Alyssa and Laura she said, "I'm putting you two together and nearest the camp. I don't know your strengths and this will give you the best place to call for help if you need it. Stay by the fire, even if you hear one of us call. You are the final defense for the wagons and the ones who wake the men if things go really bad. We take half night shifts. When you are relieved go to my wagon and sleep under it. I'll join you once the new shift is in place. Best grab your bedding before that lazy man is asleep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For half the watch Alyssa and Laura fretted and watched nervously. For the second half the struggled to remain awake. Laura could barely contain a sigh of relief when the second shift woman arrived. They were asleep almost as soon as they hit the bedding. Alyssa stirred slightly when Miri slipped in with them.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Morning found them tangled up around each other against the cold of the early morning. The men moved among the wagons, rousing the sleeping forms and hurrying them into the wagons. "Andrus thought he saw an orange patrol up the road. We need to get moving." Hard bread and sharp cheese was passed around as wagons were hitched and hurried into line.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Those cursed nobles. We can't ply our wares or trade for provisions if we get chased out of town," Miri complained during the morning part of the ride. "We should have better luck as we get closer to Eryetish. The population is larger and the merchanters are powerful enough to balance out the Tolaz family army. Even in his home town of Azkelon he hasn't done as well as he has in the smaller towns."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How is it that no one puts a stop to him?" Laura asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A few have tried. Pieces of them are displayed prominently in the town square. It is said he has magical or demonic help. He also pays off the most dangerous opponents."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We hadn't heard about any of this in Stratmore," Alyssa said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm a little surprised, but it' sonly been the last few months that Aran has been moving this way. Some say there is something over here he wants now. Others figure the merchanters and arcanes in the other areas have stopped his spread in their directions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Later in the day Alyssa asked, "Did you ever encounter Irena Katarya during your travels? I know it's a bit of a stretch, but I am trying to find her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't really know. I've heard the name in reference to the Hell Gate Wars, but nothing about what happened to her. Maybe Old Yara knows." Miri looked thoughtful and continued, "Alyssa, your mother goes by Luci, doesn't she?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that short for something else?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Her full name is Alucinia Tomarasdan, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thinking about the wars got me to remembering, Alucinia was the name of the supreme commander of the Lotus Imperial Elite I thought. Wow, your mom is her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, she is. Although I didn't know about it until just before Laura and I left."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did she bring anything from the wars with her? Maybe that's what Aran wants."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not that I know of, other than horrible memories."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the caravan stopped for the evening a larger fire was laid and there was music and dancing after the meal. Alyssa looked over to Yara's wagon and saw her seated on the steps smoking her pipe again. She approached slowly until Yara waved her nearer. "Good evening, youngling. Come to keep Old Yara company again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I had a couple of questions and Miri thought you might be able to help me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I might, if you ask them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was wondering if you remember seeing Irena those many years ago when she left Stratmore."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I'm afraid not. We were on a different part of our route when she would have been traveling. I wish I could help you more, but you will need to find others that have seen her. What was your second question?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know much about Aran Tolaz? He seems to be a real problem, but no one knows much about him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He is a nexus of power in a way. He speaks to the venal and base cravings of those with money and those seeking power over their fellows. They blindly follow him and give him the power he is beginning to assert. You would know him if you saw him in any visions. He is a medium height man, on the thinnish side, with a cruel face and violet eyes." Alyssa jumped slightly at the description. "So, he has been in your visions as well. I suspect not in a good way either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not in a good way at all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you like to tell Old Yara about it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. I think by leaving Laura and I changed the vision anyway. Have you seen what he wants?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Power and revenge, mostly. Like many of his kind." Old Yara leaned back against her steps and puffed on her pipe. "Do you have any skills you could use when we arrive in Eryetish? We are growing low on supplies and the band must gather more resources."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I can cook, clean, and run an inn. Is any of that useful? Laur is really good with sick animals. She has some xeno-healing and enough knowledge to help when the spells aren't enough."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let Daniel and Miri know, they determine strategy." They sat a while longer, Alyssa sipping the tea she had brought from the fire and Yara smoking. "It's getting late for my old bones. I will see you again, youngling." Old Yara rose stiffly and climbed into her wagon. Alyssa rose and crossed back to Laura.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">That night they curled up in the wagon with Miri again. Not long after sleep had claimed them Laura found herself on the low rise again. In the distance was the single mountain with the full blue moon above it. She started running, off the rise and out onto the wind swept sand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura started to twitch and twist until she woke Miri. "Laura, wake up. What are you dreaming?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, what?" Laura asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's happening?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Laura, ware you ok? You were having a nightmare."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not a nightmare. Home, I was trying to get home," Laura answered, still almost asleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Home? We left home and you want to go back?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Home, tower," Laura mumbled as she drifted back to sleep. Alyssa stared at her for a time until sleep claimed her as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the morning Alyssa asked, "Do you remember anything about home and tower? You mumbled it when we woke you from a nightmare."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, did you really wake me up? I was having some sort of dream, I think, but I don't remember it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the morning Alyssa approached Daniel while he was hitching up the horses. "Yara said I should let you know what Laura and I can do in case we can be of help at Eryetish." She described what she had told Yara.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think Laura will be of great help. Can you back her up? Sometimes there can be problems between a Wanderer healer and a landed patron."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During the wagon ride Miri explained some of the events. "We set up outside of town and send some of our people into town. When the landed notice they follow them back to the encampment and barter for our services. Laura, in your case that would be healing any sick animals they might have. Alyssa, you make sure nobody tries to not pay Laura for her efforts. If all goes well, we end up with enough to barter for more supplies."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And if it doesn't go well?" Laura asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We make it up as we go along. Sometimes we cut and run, if the town tries to hurt us, other times we just move on. Eryetish is pretty honest with us, so tomorrow should be a good day."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once more they passed the day in the wagon and the night on watch. The following morning the caravan rolled up to a field outside Eryetish near mid morning. Awnings were erected and tables knocked together and set underneath them. Tools for leather and metal working were pulled from storage trunks and prepared for use.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once everything was ready some of the younger people headed into town. A couple hours later they returned with a thin line of townsfolk in their wake. Miri had called it right, none of the people that asked for Laura's help tried to hold back payment or cause her any trouble at all. A few asked when she had joined the group, not remembering her from the previous arrivals. Laura just smiled and replied she had joined up for a break from her family troupe for a while.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the late afternoon Daniel, Miri, and several others returned to the town for supplies. Their reception was as cordial as the people seeking assistance. In the evening large fires were lit and the tables were cleared of tools. Townsfolk brought food and drink while the caravan's musicians played for all to dance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next day the Wanderers remained camped by Eryetish and once again provided services to the townsfolk during the day and a large party in the evening. The morning of the third day they prepared to leave. Just as Daniel was marshalling the wagons the mayor hurried up. "Please, wait. Do you have a seer in your troupe? A messenger has arrived warning us that the Tolaz is sending a large envoy our way. Do you have a seer that could tell us what this might mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We have a seer, but she is old and frail. I will see if she would attempt a seeing for you." Daniel hurried off to Yara's wagon, returning a few minutes later with Yara leaning heavily on his arm. He settled her on a stool Miri had pulled from a wagon and motioned for the mayor to come closer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A test. Spies are among you to watch what you do. Panic and he will descend upon your town, tearing it apart, searching for the source of panic." The mayor sat and digested Yara's words, rose, and hurried back to town.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A key, a powerful magic key, he searches for a lost assistant and her magic." Alyssa whispered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, youngling, he searches for the legacy of Laura's aunt. You will be safe with us until we reach Frenlayish. Then, I fear, you must strike out on your own for we go away from the path you must take. Avoid Azkelon, skirt the western edge of the Great Central Lake and find a way down river at Mishrithal to Miskaton instead. In Miskaton will be found glimmers of the path." Yara had risen and crossed to Alyssa while she was still half in a daze. "Daniel, we must leave now. Spies come with magic detection, best we not be here for them." Daniel finished assembling the caravan and within minutes they were on the road.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next two days were repeats of the basic travel mode that Alyssa and Laura had grown used to. They asked Miri about Mishrithal and were warned to be careful. When they asked about Miskaton Miri had little to tell, other than what they had heard over the years as well. Miskaton, center of arcane knowledge and learning, and home to the great school of magic.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the late afternoon, of the third day, Alyssa and Laura bade a sad farewell to the troupe of Wanderers. Andrus pressed a small role of parchment into Laura's hands. "This is a rough map of the river and road from here to Azkelon, and the paths to the west of the city. I hope it helps you avoid trouble."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They unrolled the map and studied it, then hoisted their packs and walked in the direction the caravan had gone for several more kilometers. A small, rough track took them around Frenlayish at the boundary of the forest. They reached the southern fields around Frenlayish by dark. They slipped off the track and deeper into the forest before setting out their bedding.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Every sound snapped them awake, the damp of the ground seeped into their blankets and left them huddled tightly together for what little warmth they could muster. Morning found them stiff, cold, and tired. They ate a small, cold breakfast and began walking. In the distance they could hear sounds of laughter and voices calling back and forth. The brightly colored wagons of the Wanderers stood out against the dull earth of the spring fields. They gave the wagons one last longing look before turning and resolutely beginning to walk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Movement helped ease the cold and stiffness. The day warmed rapidly until they were uncomfortably warm by noon. The stopped for a short rest in the shade of the forest. They talked of the adventures to come for a little while, until the act of walking began to take up more and more of their energy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When evening came they edged back into the woods again, ate a cold meal, and fell into the bedding. Alyssa tried to stay awake and keep watch, but within minutes she had slipped into sleep as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They woke late to a grey and cold sky. Chill breezes swirled around, unable to decide which way to blow. Moving stiffly, they packed up and set off. Sore, tired feet protested, joints ached, and the cold sapped at their strength. Moving warmed them slightly and the aches faded to dull throbs as they pushed forward. By noon they were almost feeling good, until the skies opened up in a sheet of water. Scrambling and running they dove for the cove of the forest canopy, finally finding a large copse of trees where the ground was still mostly dry. Laura gathered what dry wood she could find while Alyssa laid and started a small fire. They huddled as close to it as they dared, trying to soak up the meager warmth.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Unable to get warm in their sodden clothes, they stripped and wrapped themselves in the blankets for their bedding. At least warmth started to creep back into numb hands and feet. "Some adventure, lover," Laura whined.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They never mention this in the tales, do they?" Alyssa replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, they don't do they Fred?" A scruffy, thin man asked, stepping into the clearing. He was followed by two even shabbier men holding large daggers. "They don't talk about naked, defenseless women either. So dearies, we can do this easy or hard. I don't much care either way. Now, the easy way'd be for you to lay down on the blankets and wait nicely for us. The hard way, well, that don't need explaining, does it?" The women held the blankets tighter and moved back to back. "I was hoping you choose the hard way, it is much more fun!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stay back!" Alyssa warned as the leader closed in confidently. Alyssa kicked out as he reached for the blanket. A grimy hand grabbed her ankle and pulled sharply. She fell back, starting to fall, until she released the blanket instead. Hoping back she regained her footing and lashed out with a series of punches.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura tried to grab her corner of the blanket, bit it slipped through her fingers. She moved to cover herself until she saw the other two men closing in on her. Instead she spun to face them. They smiled and moved closer, daggers at the ready. "We won't hurt you much, unless you make us," one of them crooned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stay back!" Laura spat back, raising her fists. The silent man darted forward, grabbed her, and hauled her to the ground. The second one laughed and reached for her flailing legs. Laura lashed out and struggled but was losing against the larger men until there was a bright flash and the on that had tackled her rolled away. His sightless eyes stared up at the sky. A smoking hole burned through his chest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa landed several blows on her attacked. He slashed back with a dagger, drawing a deep line across her belly. She staggered back, hissing in pain and surprise. He laughed and followed her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The second man stared for a moment before throwing himself on top of Laura. Another brilliant flash and his headless body flopped lifeless on her. The smell of burned flesh filled her nose as she struggled to push him off. She rose to her feet and swayed. "Leave her alone, you pig!" she yelled at the last man. He turned at the shout and Alyssa darted forward and slammed her elbow into his throat. He slashed back, missing, and dropped, grasping and gasping to the ground. Alyssa smashed her heal into his wrist, grabbed his knife, and slashed it across his throat. Blood sprayed her as she stepped back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh gods, what have we done?" Alyssa choked out. She turned away and vomited onto the ground. Laura followed with the same reaction moments later. Shaking with reaction they quickly gathered their things and left the grove. Cold rain splashed down through gaps in the canopy washing some of the blood off Alyssa.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where did they come from?" Laura asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That away," Alyssa pointed back toward where the first man had emerged.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're going to freeze out here if we don't get warm. You think they had a shelter somewhere?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What if there are more?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We stop them from hurting anyone else," Laura replied, still shaking like a leaf. She turned, retraced her steps back to the clearing. She forced herself to approach the bodies, struggling not to gag, and grab the daggers from them. "Here," she held one out to Alyssa. Alyssa gulped, nodded, and gingerly took the knife. "You think you could track them? You know I'm no good at tracking." Alyssa managed a shaky smile and nodded. Once back from the grove she hurled into the bushes again. She stood, white and shaking, as she began to look for the trail.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took many minutes before she started moving away from the grove of trees. Laura motioned her to a halt, slipped off her pack and pulled out some of the blankets. She draped one over herself and another over Alyssa before motioning to move on. Two hours after the attack they came to a low building in a tiny clearing. No smoke rose from the chimney and they heard only the sounds of the forest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa led the way around the clearing until they were in a blind spot for the building. Slowly they edged closer, listening all the while. Once the reached the wall they slid around toward the door, dropping to crawl under the low window half way down the longer side. Laura paused and listened at the window for long moments, then waved ALyssa on. At the door they hefted the daggers, drew deep breaths, and shoved open the door. The smell of unwashed clothes and bodies wafted out, but there was no movement. Laura slipped in, dodged right and Alyssa followed, dodging left. When no one attacked they stopped to look around the single room more carefully. Clothes lay in piles in the corners, discarded packs and bags were scattered about the floor. Jewelry was piled in an untidy heap on the table, some with dried blood stains clinging in the chains and reliefs. Ash was piled high in a fireplace at the back and wood was dropped in tangled piles nearby. A small ladder reached up to a tiny loft where dried branches and grasses formed a crude mattress.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You think it's safe?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, but if we don't get warm soon we will be in serious trouble."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa started scraping out the fireplace while Laura kept watch through the door. Soon a fire was going, driving some of the chill out of the room. Laura pushed the door closed and braced the table against it. "At least we'll hear it if they try to get in that way." She sat down near the fire, facing the window.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa sat down behind her and held her close. "That's another thing they never mention. The awful feeling after...after..." Alyssa stopped, tears streaming from her eyes. "Oh gods, I can't believe I did that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shh, it'll be ok. It was him or you." Laura rose, crossed to a water barrel and looked inside. It smelled ok, even though the level was quite low. She pulled a tunic from her pack, wet it in the barrel, and started to clean the blood off Alyssa.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How can you be so calm? What happened to those two on you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In case you haven't noticed I'm not exactly calm. However, I've butchered cattle and pigs with my father so death isn't a complete stranger to me. I don't know what happened. They were on me and were about to...to..." Sobs wracked her body as reaction set in. "S..s...see, not so calm here either." They held each other while heat slowly seeped back in and reaction slowly faded. Once Laura stopped shaking she returned to cleaning off blood. "As I was about to say, they were on me and then one wasn't. The second one , I don't know, something flashed and...and he was gone too. It...had to be...magic, but I don't know that kind. That was like the arcane magic of the epics, not the simple healing based spells I know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly the fire drove back the chill in the room. Laura rose and hung their clothes over the stools, after sweeping debris off them. "I wonder if there are any others still out...hunting..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Gods, I hope not!" Alyssa replied. "We should keep watch though. I can, if you'd like to sleep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not ready to sleep yet." They spent the rest of the afternoon feeding the fire and listening for approaching enemies. No one had come to bother them as evening slid into night. The rain which had been dripping onto the roof increased to a pounding and sheets of water flowed down outside the window.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After Alyssa's third yawn in under two minutes Laura asked, "Would you want to sleep? I can take first watch."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I think I'd like that," Alyssa answered. She hugged Laura closely and climbed up the ladder to the loft. Filthy bedding was strewn about over the top of the mattress. She pulled it off and tossed it down to the main floor. "Could you hand me my pack?" Moments after pulling her blankets up around herself she was asleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the fire, Laura struggled to stay awake. Every time she would start to slip she would think about the men coming at her. It would jolt her back to wakefulness. She was slipping for the twentieth time when a shriek from the loft snapped her awake. She ran for the ladder and found Alyssa sitting upright and shaking. "Gods, no, no, no...not again, please!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is it babe?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Every time I sleep I see him again. All that blood, the sick crunch of his throat, his awful breath..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Easy, I'm here. Let me keep the dreams back for you. Lay back down, I'm here." Slowly Alyssa stopped shaking and sank back down on the bed. Laura propped herself against Alyssa's pack and held her friend. Slowly her eyes slipped down into sleep as well. The tower rose in the distance and shot a beam of light to her hand. In it the ring gleamed and sparkled with inner fire. Her vision slid sideways to the clearing where rough hands pawed at her. The ring spat fire and the first one dropped away. It spat fire again and the second one fell. Once again the scene shifted back to the tower and the empty plain. Lightning flashed from the ring to the ground in front of her. A large gout of earth erupted upwards in a brilliant flash. The beam from the tower flicked off, leaving only the tower under the full blue moon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa's dreams started dark and troubled. Her hand flashed and blood splattered again. Then the view slid back, rewinding as the men emerged from the forest, tracking them back to the hovel where her body slept. Six men wolfed half cooked meat and slipped into the drizzle of the day. Her view followed the others to the main road where they stopped a simple traveler. His cloak fell back, revealing orange and black garb, as his hands brought a strange item up. It spat fire, dropping the three bandits in seconds. The man adjusted his cloak and continued up the road, leaving the bodies where they lay.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa awoke enough to hear Laura's even breathing beside her. Gently she kissed her awake. "We are safe here love. You may sleep too." Laura pushed the pack out of the way and slid down beside her girlfriend. For the first time since leaving Stratmore, they made love, then fell asleep, curled together.</p>
<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Another grey day greeted them when the woke late in the morning. Rain still pattered on the roof and chill had crept back in with the death of the fire. While Alyssa laid a new one Laura gathered up the refuse of the bandits and carried it outside. She found a broken broom and swept as much dirt and debris out as she could. "Might as well make it smell nicer in here. I'd like to stay until the rain breaks, if that's ok with you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It certainly is," Alyssa replied with a large smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two days later the rain stopped in the middle of the night. Morning dawned sunny and warm. Outside the air was fresh and crisp, with the scent of early spring earth and growth. After a leisurely breakfast they packed up their gear and as much coinage from the loot as they could easily carry. Alyssa carefully closed the door on the hovel, setting the latch to keep larger creatures out. "Someone else might benefit from this as well," Alyssa explained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Should we try and turn in the jewelry, see if there is a reward?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, we'd probably be accused of taking it in the first place. Better just to leave it and let someone else have it. The coin should see us pretty far." Alyssa led the way down the path she had seen in her vision. It twisted its way over to the main road and emerged about half a zeem further along than where they ahd left the road in the rain. Carrion eaters had begun their work on the remains of the other three bandits. The women gave them wide berth and continued their trek toward the Great Central Lake.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During the second day after leaving the hovel they began to see large areas of tilled land. Small houses dotted the fields and farmers were out readying the land for the planting. The number of travelers on the road increased as well. They edged to gether slightly, nervous in the presence of so many strangers. Two hours after entering the tilled lands they had seen more strangers on the road than had come through Stratmore in the last year. Most of the people were friendly, calling out greetings and wishing them well. A small patrol of orange and black clad figures looked them up and down, but didn't interfere with their movements.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Late in the afternoon they arrived at the fork in the road to Mishrithal. Traffic dropped rapidly as they moved away from the Azkelon road. Early evening found them camped in a small copse of trees between two farmed areas. They had given brief thought to asking for space in one of the barns, but decided not to risk the notice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura slowed as they reached the beginning of the cleareed fields around Mishrithal. "We are almost there. What do you intend to do once we reach town? Do we have or want a plan of some form?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa slowed to a stop beside her. "I hadn't thought about it. I guess I figured I'd just start asking about Irena, but that seems kind of silly after all these years. Do you have any ideas?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Weren't we supposed to start looking in Miskaton?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, right. So on to Miskaton then." Alyssa started walking again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Later in the afternoon they approached the town of Mishrithal. The road swept down from a low rise and past a sentinal post. The town itself sprawled along the river, a mix of wooden houses in all sizes and stone b\mansions and buildings. Warves stuck long fingers out into the southern reaches of the Great Central Lake. Deep, blue this end formed a small bay with Azkelon at the north and Mishrithal at the south. The main body of the lake stretched north-east and ended at Foriskel. River boats sailed the lake, linking the many villages to the larger cities and to the rest of the Valley of Experiment through the network of rivers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several ships were drawn up to the docks with crowds of longshoremen scurrying to and fro. A steady stream of wagons and people passed throiugh the sentry post entering and exiting the city. For a moment Alyssa and Laura stopped, taking in the sight of so much activity in one place.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The guards barely looked at them as they asked, "Name, village, and business."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alyssa Tomarasdan and Laura Sannall, Stratmore-Upon-Comcrash, traveling to Miskaton." Their village got a small reaction and then the guards waved them on. Beyond the sentinels the road narrowed as it passed into the first wave of buildings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A small boy darted from a cluster of small boys and asked, "Would you fair ladies desire a city guide today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And how much would you be asking godd sir?" Laur responded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A shiny silver planet would buy my services for the entire day."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hmm, I don't know," Alyssa started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, please? Alright, five moons, five moons for the entire day. It's been days since anyone's hired me," the boy complained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A silver it is, provided we can call you something other than 'hey boy'," Laura offered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am Brin Tallmadge of the east road Tallmadges."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've not heard of this family, yet I sense a great nobility in it," Laura commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The boy looked uncertain for a moment, not sure whether to accept the strange comment or take insult at the teasing. In the end he smiled, bowed, and replied, "Thank you, great lady. My humble family would be honored to assist you in any way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We would seek refreshment from the long and dusty road. A place of good repute, yet modest of price."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, I know just the place. The Far Shore Inn awaits us." The boy turned and started down the street. He threaded his way gracefully through the crowds, stopping only when his patrons were not immediately behind him. He returned to their side and eased them through the crowd as well. After a bewildering series of turns he brought them to the front of a modest building several streets back from the lake. The main room was well lit by the large windows that fronted on the street. The floors were well swept and the tables clean. Without hesitation he made his way to a table near the back wall with a good view of the windows and entry. "Will this be suitable, great lady?" he asked Laura.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A fine choice, noble sir." Laura settled onto the bench. Alyssa followed, smiling at the antics of the two. A serving boy hurried over and inquired after their desires. They ordered ale and their guide ordered nothing. "Do you have food available this time of day?" Laura asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bread and cheese. Hot meals start at sundown."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A platter suitable for three please," Laura requested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Three copper moons please," the server replied. :aura handed him the coin, plus a fourth moon tip. He hurried off and they returned to their drinks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is this a decent place to stay?" Alyssa asked Brin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Depends, it's a bit on the expensive side unless you like to be pampered with maid service in your rooms, hot baths at your desire, and in room food if you specify what you want and when you'd like it. Otherwise I can show you a place where the rooms are as nice but much less expensive down near the docks. Most of the river crews stay there when they are in port."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cheaper would be better, right Laur?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes." The server interrupted their conversation briefly when he brought the food. "We just came from a small village. What is happening in the local scene?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Tolaz is interfering more nd more in the local scen, but that's pretty much everywhere, from what others have said. It's spring and the farmers are preparing for the growing season, banditry is down around town because the local guards have increased their numbers to counter frictions with the Tolaz, otherwise not too much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They ate on in silence. When they were done Alyssa rose and said, "Maybe you could take us to the other inn now? We've been traveling most of the day and I could really use some rest." The guide led them out and back toward the docks. The inn was at the transition from the rough, lower class section of the docks and the market and merchanters facilities.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The sun was setting in the west and activity at the docks was slowing for the night. Out on the lake boats were anchored, waiting for the morning light to continue their voyages. One, an oddly shaped vessel, continued on course for the city docks. "Do you know what that is?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is the River Wind. A very strange group of people run it, using magic of some kind. It travels any time, day or night, and seems imune to river currents. It is rare for them to stop here. Mostly they trade between the really large cities such as Miskaton, Azkelon, Foriskel, Delgakar, and Tzell. They rarely take passengers and keep to themselves. I can't tell you much about the crew, only that the captain is a woman, a rare occurance for these waters."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The boat arrived at the docks just as the last of the sun disappeared below the mountains. Silently its crew swarmed off and made it fast to an empty berth. Now that it was closer they got a better view of the boat. A large padel wheel, similar to ones used on grain mills, was attached to the back of the boat. A chain loop wrapped around a large toothed gear and disappeared into the hull. A three story superstructure rose from the main deck. The main level looked to be a large cargo container. The second deck was slightly smaller and sprouted doors and windows, probably crew or passenger quraters. Perched at the very top was a spacious wheelhouse with large windows, giving a good view to all sections of the boat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The crew set about making the boat fast and lowering the cargo ramp. Everything was acomplished in toatl silence. Their only communication by means of elaborate hand signs. Once the lines were snubbed and checked, a woman descended from the wheelhouse and made her way ashore. She turned and headed toward the dock master's office, catching the man just before he had locked up for the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A short conversation ensued, followed by a group of longshoremen returning with the woman. The deck crew had already loosened the lines on a small deck hoist and were using it to pull cargo out of the main hold and place it on the dock. A weird whirring and hissing followed its every movement. Laura turned to Brin after several minutes of watching and asked, "What is that noise?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. Something from the magic of the boat, I guess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura turned and entered the inn. Inside it wasn't very different from the previous one. A large bar, tables scattered about, most full this time of day, and everything relatively clean and in good shape. She approached the bar, flagging down the proprietor. "Do you have any rooms tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A couple left, sure. One bed or two?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"One would be fine, two persons and a small amount of gear. Do you have locks on th doors?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We do, but we don't take any respoinasbility. There's plenty in this town that can get through most locks. That'll be four planets, five if you want a hot bath prepared."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like the bath, but we're not quite in for the night. Can I let you know when to prepare it?" Laura slipped him seven planets.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Certainly. Tell me, or my son over there," he motioned to a tall, stocky man adding wood to the fireplace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, good sir." Laura returned to Alyssa where she was still watching the boat crew.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I feel like I should know this crew," Alyssa mumbled as Laura walked up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you seen them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think so," Alyssa slowly answered. "Ah well, a hot bath and a long sleep call. Shall we?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've got us a room. I'll get the bath started on our way in. Brin, could you meet us here in the morning?" Laura replied. She slipped over to the bar as they walked in and requested the bath. They headed up to the second floor, where their room was. It was on the front of the building, facing the lake and docks. Alyssa pulled the single stool up to the window and stared out at the River Wind crew.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The knock at the door pulled her back from her brooding silence. The proprietor poked his head in far enough to announce the bath and give directions down to the main floor and to the back of the inn. They grabbed their gear and headed down. Inside the small bath chamber they placed their gear at the farthest point from the door. Sinking into the hot water was heavenly. They remained until the water was almost cold, then quickly washed and climbed out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They hurried back to their room and bolted the door. Alyssa pulled a wedge from the bottom of her pack and shoved it under the door. "A trick my mom told me about," she explained. She was almost to the bed when she decided to take one more look out the window. For just a moment she thought she saw a figure fly up from the River Wind and disappear over the town.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura slipped up behind Alyssa, wrapped her arms around around her, and whispered in her ear, "Come to bed lover. Worry about it in the morning." Slowly Alyssa turned and let Laura pulled her back to the bed. They fell into it in a tangle and yanked blankets over themselves. Sleep dragged them down rapidly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura tumbled back onto the plain, tower in the distance. Longing built in her until tears streamed from her eyes. She reached for it, she ran toward it, but it never got any nearer. The ring pulsed brightly and a room shimmered into view, almost solid, but still transparent enough that a hint of the tower was visible through it. The walls were undressed stone. A narrow passage led off in front of her and a second one led off to her right. The inner corner of wall had been bevelled to form a forty-five degree angle instead of a sharp corner. At chest level was a small indentation. Her hand rose on its own and slipped the facets of her ring into the depression. A low, heavy click echoed from the wall and a small green glow appeared in the indent behind the ring.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She pulled her hand away and the glow remained. She pushed the ring in again and the glow extinguished, followed by another heavy click. The room and the tower faded into darkness as Alyssa thrashed into her. She awoke enough to roll and pull Alyssa closer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa floated over a river, the River Wind steaming along under her. A dark, winged shape flew from the shadows of the shore to the deck behind the pilothouse. It settled onto the deck and walked into the wheelhouse. Alyssa followed the shadowy shape as it came back out, descended the ladders to the main deck and slipped into the cargo room. A square of light appeared in the floor and a head of black hair popped up from below. With the head came the sounds of metal moving over metal and the clank of moving chain. Thye vision faded before she could see anyone clearly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa clawed her way to wakefullness, hauled herself off the bed, and stumbled to the window. The River Wind was already gone. In th distance a set of lights moved on the lake, possibly the boat in question. She fumbled her way back into bed, not quite waking Laura.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Laura," she said the instant Laura stirred. "I know who 's on the River Wind. I think its some of Irena's friends. I saw the winged woman in a vision last night, flying back to the ship. We need to find where that boat was headed!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, ok," Laura responded slowly. Alyssa was throwing her stuff into her pack and hurrying toward the door. She had to hurry to get her stuff ready and run after Alyssa as she dashed from the room. Downstairs Alyssa was already talking to the inn keeper. She finished and started for the door before Laura could catch up. "Alyssa, wait. Where are you going?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dock master's office. They should know where the River Wind was headed." Alyssa strode rapidly down the street, ignoring Brin as he ran up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Morning, lady," Brin greeted Laura as she hurried to keep up. "Where's the other lady headed?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dock master's. She want to know where the River Wind is headed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's easy. She came in across the lake so she will be headed down river to Miskaton next. I've never heard of her deviating from that pattern."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lyss, hey, wait a minute," Laura called.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa knocked on the door as Laura came up beside her. The door opened and a harried, impatient man poked his head through. "Yeah?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need to know where the River Wind was headed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And who are you? You don't look official to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, I'm not really..." The door slammed in her face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa raised her hand, clenched it into a fist, and was about to strike when Laurqa interrupted. "Wait, Brin says they're headed down river. They came across the lake and now they head toward Miskaton."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why didn't you say so?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was trying, you weren't listening."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Brin, where can we catch a boat down river?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At any of the dock taverns, but you..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's go!" Alyssa spun from the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute! How fast do you think we can get a boat? How do we know it's someone we can trust? Maybe we should be a little less hasty about this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But they'll know about Irena. I have to talk to them!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lyss, think for a minute. They have several hours start on us. Unless we find a boat going straight to Miskaton, we probably won't catch up. Yara said we could find answers in Miskaton, so, either they'll be there and will be giving answers or something else." Alyssa just glared at her and continued along the dock street. "Brin, please, try and get her to go into a decent place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Brin darted ahead and waved toward a door. "Ladies, you can find what you want here. Plenty of captains willing to take you anywhere you want to go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura slipped him another seven moons when Alyssa wasn't watching. "For today and for the help," she whispered to him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa strode into the common room and scanned the tables. Half were full of boat crew drinking, eating, and talking. She tried to pick the captains from the rest of the crew, but wasn't really certain in most cases. Brin stepped up to her and motioned toward a table to the right. "Samrath is a reputable captain. You might try him first." The man Brin was pointing to was younger than she had expected. Possibly not more than a few years older than her. He was laughing and cutting up with an older man and woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Excuse me," Alyssa said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My guide tells me you might be taking passengers. I need to get down river, to Miskaton. Would you be going there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm headed that way. Probably leaving either tonight or tomorrow morning. It depends on when I get the cargo I'm contracted to haul. I have room for a couple of passengers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What would the fee be and how long would it take?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Since I'm going that way, three gold stars per passenger. Another three stars each for food if you want better than the crew eats. The trip will be eight days. I have three additional stops along the way, part of the contract."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Eight days? How I am supposed to catch the River Wind if it takes eight days?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The River Wind? Why would you want to catch up to them? They're bad news."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bad news? Are they pirates or something?" Laura asked, worried.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, they're lawful enough, but the ship and crew reek of magic. Now I've got no issue with arcanes, but ancient magic? That just scares me and that ship is thick with it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ancient magic?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've heard of detection for magic, but how do you know there's ancient magic on that boat? Last I heard it wasn't detectable the same way." Laura added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah. My father was a hunter for that stuff when I was a boy. He'd prowl the valley looking for anything he could find. One day he found something really bad. I don't know how to describe what it was but it had the usual runes and gems and little levers on it. When he tried to pry it loose from the container it was in, it exploded and shredded him. I had enough healing to keep him alive and get him home, but he never completely recovered from it. When I left he gave me a wand he had. It glows red in the presence of ancient magic and every time I get near the River Wind it glows brighter than I've ever seen anywhere else."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So I've heard of this ancient magic, but I don't know what it means," Alyysa said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's stuff left by the Ancients, when they journeyed to the Outer Worlds, to seek salvation for all of us. The ancient magic would allow us to fly though the air, burrow under the earth, and ride beneath the seas as they did before they left. At least it would if anyone knew how to make it work. In my father's time there was a band of adventurers through here that had some small undrestanding of it. They could make small items do miraculous things. But they didn't share the knowleedge, nor did they let anyone near their items. Some say The Tolaz has some use of it as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would that be sticks that can fire light?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's the most common rumor."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Will you be here for a while, captain?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, til half day anyway, waiting for my cargo contact."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa moved away. "Too slow. We need someone faster."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lyss, you've waited your entire life to find Irena. A few more days will be ok. We can get to Miskaton and then we can start looking again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe. It just feels like time is running out. Can you understand that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, yes I can. Now come one, let's accept Samrath's offer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa slowly returned to the table. "I'd like to take you up on your offer, captain. There will be two of us and crew food will be fine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Excellent! Glad to have you aboard. This is Galena, my first mate." The older woman, blonde, sun burned, and whip corded, nodded. "And this is Mishka, the bosun." The grizzled old man nodded warily. "You can check back with me here later today or I can leave a message for you where you are staying."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're at the Lake's Edge. Leave a message with the inn keeper and we will check with him." ALyssa turned and headed for the door. Laura could still see the nervous energy in her jerky movement.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outside she was about to ask a question when an older boy ran up to Brin and started talking excitedly in a different laguage. Brin paled a whatever he was hearing. "The Tolaz are looking to talk to people who arrived in the last day. Something to do with bandit attacks just north of Azkelon."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa saw the road again and the bandits, killed in an instant by the Tolaz retainer. The she saw him pull out a short wand and wave it over the corpses. It flashed blue several times and each time he withdrew an item from where it rested. As he turned to put it away it glowed a very faint greenish when swept past the forest between the hovel and the road. Puzzled, he kept it in his hand and walked further up the road. This time when he waved it the green glow pointed at the hovel from a different angle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The man stepped into the forest and began walking in a zig zag pattern, always trying to keep moving in the direction of the hovel. He found it about mid day and did a quick examination, finding the tosssed clothes, the swept up and cleaned hovel, and finally, trail sign back to the clearing. He swiftly checked the bodies, smiling grimly when he saw the two killed by magic. He took a strange grey rectangular box out of a pocket sewn inside his cloak and spoke at it. "Tothlan to command."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Command, what is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Someone on my route has used magic created by Kaltereth. You might alert the boss."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Acknowledged Tothlan. See if you can pick up the trail." The images faded to find Laura and Brin watching her closely.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, a real life seer! I've only heard about people like you in stories!" Brin said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What was it?" Laura asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your magic has come to the attention of the Tolaz."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My...my...magic?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The dead attackers in the forest. Does the name Kaltereth mean anything to you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kaltereth? No, why?" Laura answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The magic you used is based on something she did. The Tolaz are looking for it with special detection items and such."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My brother Markan mentioned her. Her works are part of the required reading at the School of Magic where he is studying," Brin added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's she known for?" Laura asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She was expanding on the Tesch Mar's research into gates between worlds, their links to high powered magic nodes, and how there was a heiracrchy of various strength nodes all linked together. Her research was quite thorough and was aided by her discussions with Margla Fleshfeaster. The common talk says they were actually friends, although I have no idea how that could work."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would explain why the Tolaz want to track anything of hers though." Alyssa mused. "Is Kaltereth still at the school?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, she disappeared years ago. Shortly after the Hell Gate Wars. The headmistress of the school sent out search parties but none found any trace," Brin replied. "Uh oh. Look up by the inn." Brin motioned toward the Lake's edge where a group of Tolaz retainers had gathered. Two split off and entered the inn while the rest idly scanned the streets.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Back in the Captain's Rest, before they think to talk to us," Alyssa hissed. Back inside Laura led the way to one of the few tables near the back. Alyssa and Laura settled in while Brin went to the bar and got a round of ales. "Now what? They'll come in here eventually."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe we could stay on the boat until it leaves," Laura suggested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What if they come asking at the boat? How much do you think the captain would need to keep quiet?" Alyssa responded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe we shopuld take the overland route, at least to the next town or two down the river," Laura tried again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lady, there are roads only as far down as the next village. After that the swamps made boats the accepted way, You could strike out overland, but it would be hard going to get through the swamps and back to the river."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Brin, what about the tunnels? You could hide them there, only a few of us know where they are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, Jolrath, come great ladies, I know where you may stay. I can come and talk with the captain tonight." Brin headed toward the back of the inn, through the kitchen. He winked at the young woman at the stove as he darted by. In the back courtyard he turned right along the foundation until he found a loose rock. It pulled loose with a slight tug revealing a small grey metal sheet with two faintly glowing gems. Brin touched the green one and a three by five section of the foundation slipped back a foot and silently slid over, revealing steep stairs into darkness. "Jolrath, you lead, ladies, please follow him, and I'll be right behind."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa went right behind Jolrath, followed by Laura. As soon as Brin was on the stairs he touched a red gem on the wall. The opening silently slid back shut and latched with a small click. Brin touched an amber gem and a small section of wall opened. His fingers flew over the small white gems revealed and there was a second, slightly louder click. Another few movements and a pale green glow spread in lines down the tunnel.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We found this several weeks ago. A strange lady appeared in town, then disappeared without a trace. When she came back a second time, we folllowed her," Jollrath explained as he moved along the tunnel. Laura slowed as the moved deeper into the tunnel, until she was walking in slow motion. Her eyes had unfocused and she seemed to be moving without really seeing what was around her. One hundred yards along the tunnel widened into a semi-circular room with a dark metal door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura slowly walked toward the door and stared at it. Slowly she raised her right hand and placed it against a section of wall to the right of the door. A deep clunk echoed through the room and the door slid up with a whoosh of noise. Laura stared at her hand and everyone else stared at her. "Damn, I've never seen that happen before," Brin stammered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura moved slowly through the door to a small pedestal set near a shallow groove in the floor of the next room. "Everyone in here please," she said calmly. Once everyone was inside she pushed a glowing green gem on the pedestal, moved to the nearest wall, and leaned against it. The door they entered through slid shut with a heavy thumb, followed by series of deep clicks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Laur, what are you doing?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I remember, I've never been here, but I remember..." Laura mumbled softly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now what?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We wait. But not for long." Laura remained leaning against the wall. In the distance a strange, almost hissing sound started very softly and grew rapidly in volume. Large doors opened in the far wall and a silvery egg shaped thing slid into view. It slowed and stopped right in front of the pedestal and then a section of it swung up. Through the opening several comfortable looking chairs could be seen. Laura immediately slipped inside, moved to one of the chairs, and settled into it. "Lyss, this can get us to Miskaton. Brin, are you staying or coming?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stay...staying." Brin backed away slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Once the large doors close, use the green gem by the door. It works just like the one you brought us in through," Laura told them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you can secure the first door in any way once you are out, you might want to do so. The Tolaz will find the buttons. I can't see if they will get in." Alyssa told Brin. "Jolrath, nice to meet you. You will make it to Miskaton, don't worry." Alyssa slowly approached the opening, stopping just outside. "How, what are you doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This ancient magic egg will take us to Miskaton, using paths the ancients trod. I, gods, it's like she's in my head."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kaltereth. I see her doing things, like this, I've been dreaming, like you dream, but it's always the same thing. A tower, on a lone mountain, in the middle of a wasteland. I have to get there. It...it's my home, her home."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The lone tower, you say?" Jolrath asked. "Kaltereth found the tower of Tesch Mar where she learned of his theories on gates. It's what started her own researches."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know where it is?" Laura asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, its location was lost when Kaltereth disappeared."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could come with us, get to Miskaton sooner. I am sure we can all come back this way..." Laura's voice trailed off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to attend the school and for that I need starting fees. Plus what about my family?" Jolrath replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It would be safer for the two of you to come right now," ALyssa said. "The Tolaz will be watching this area for the next days. Damn it, everything is muddy, I can't be sure what is happening around us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Brin stepped into the egg, "I'm in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jolrath entered more slowly, "Ok, I guess..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa stepped in last, slipped to the chair closest to Laura, "Ok babe. You sure you know what we're doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura nodded, set her hand on a series of multi-colored gems on the right arm of the chair, and pushed a glowing red one. Then she pushed a series of white ones with strange runes on them. Similar runes appeared, floating in a small black glassy strip above the gems. There was a faint hiss as the large opening swung closed and latched, then the egg began to move. Laura leaned her haed bcak against the chair and said, "This will take a little while."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Muted noises came from outside the egg as it moved, stopped, then moved again. Four white faces stared around the small interior, wondering what sort of horrible things were happeing around them. After a few minutes the noises vanished and only a sense of motion remained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nerves kept everyone silent for the first part of the journey. After five or ten minutes Alyssa asked, "What else has that thing shown you? What other surprises await me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just the tower and now this thing..." Laura trailed off, eyes unfocusing as something else drifted into her awareness. "This can take me to the tower. I know the codes to get to the tower!" Her hand reached for the controls again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa stopped her, "No, Miskaton and Irena first." For a moment Laura looked like she would protest, then she relaxed her hand and sat back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thirty minutes after the egg began moving there were more sounds and stops and starts. A few minutes later the egg came to a stop and the side opened up. Warm light iluminated the egg chamber. Tapestries of arcane battles lined the walls. A door stood open to a small anti-chamber with several large couches. Laura led the way to one and sat down. "It's no use trying to get through the door over there. We have to wait for the headmistress to come and get us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Brin and Jolrath stood nervously. Alyssa perched on the edge of the couch near Laura and stared at the door in question. It was heavy wood, carved with ornate runes and symbols, with a tiny brasss grate, closed over by a piece of dark wood.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have Kaltereth's key, yet you are not her," a warm voice called through a grate in the door. "Would you like to explain who you are, why you are here, any how it is you have her key?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kaltereth was my aunt and I inherited her key. These are my friends. We left Mishrithal abruptly to avoid the Tolaz retainers asking about strangers in town," Laura answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What proof do you offer? How shall I know you haven't stolen the key from Kaltereth?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She was a tesch level mage. Would she have not enchanted her key? Besides, it likes me enough to show me her tower and compel me to go to it. Can't you scan my aura or something like that to verify my claim?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can, however, I prefer to hear your story at the same time. It makes the checking so much more acurate. You still haven't introduced yourselves. I am not inclined to open the door on just anyone," the voice replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We shouldn't give out our names," Alyssa whispered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Unless you plan to get back into that device and leave, you should give me your names," the voice replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am Laura, this is my friend Alyssa, and these wo are Brin and Jolrath," Laura replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The door opened and an older, blonde woman walked in. Her face was long and square jawed, with wide, puffy lips and a large nose. Her eyes were sharp and watchful. She wore simple robes of grey and had two assistants standing in the hallway behind her. "Welcome to the School of Magic. Jolrath, should I know you from somewhere?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My brother, Rabat, is here at the school, mistress. Many saw we look like each other," Jolrath replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He is an excellent student. You should be very proud. Is fleeing the Tolaz your only reason for coming here? I can have you escorted to the public sections of the school, unless you are planning to get back in the egg and return to Mishrithal."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was trying to get here anyway. I am looking for information on Irena Katarya and I want to talk to the crew of the River Wind," Alyssa stated.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Irena Katarya, the shadowdancer?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've not heard that name in a long time. Why do you seek the River Wind crew?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think they know something about Irena."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you seek Irena? She is likely dead by now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She came from my village and I grew up hearing about her and I want to find out about her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry to have wasted your time, but I can't tell you anything about her. What do you want to see the River Wind crew about? They are well known around here and well respected."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think they know something about Irena, or some of her companions at least."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will show you to the public sections of the school. Laura, if you wish to use your key to the eggs again, please have one of the staff get me and I will let you in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you," Laura replied. The woman turned and led the way down a stone work corridor. Her two assistants waited for the four in the room to follow the mistress, then closed the door and fell in behind. A spiral stone stair waited at the end of the narrow corridor. It rose in steep steps up twenty meters and openned into a small library. A book shelf swung back and clicked shut as the last assistant stepped through.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Beyond the library was an office and workshop littered with partially constructed items, manuscripts, scraps of notes and calculations, as well as potions, beakers, components, and mixtures. "Don't mind the mess. For all that I am head mistress I still can't get organized." Beyond the office was a large balcony overlooking a large entry hall. "This is the administrative building. We are on the western edge of the central quad. The school occupies its own island in the city of Miskaton. For those of you that haven't been here before, Miskaton is a canal city. Most of our homes, businesses, and other places are on pilings and islands in the marsh and lake at the confluence of two major rivers. When the River Wind arrives she will tie up at the docks at the east dike. Boats can be hired as needed or you can make your way through town on various interconnecting walkways. You could pay one of the lower class level students as a guide. Many are looking for extra coin from time to time. Now, if you will excuse me, I need to get back to my regular duties." She turned to leave.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Excuse me," Laura said quietly. "May I use the school library? I'd like to find out more about Kaltereth."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You may. Lyrillan, please escort Laura to the library and let Marsa know she is authorized to access the stacks." She turned and walked away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's go find the waterfront and see if we can find out when the River Wind might be due," Alyssa suggested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd prefer to stay here and look through the library for a while," Laura replied. "Even if they don't stop anywhere along the way it will take them several days to get here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't believe you want to sit in some moldy old library when we could be out getting information and checking out a new town," Alyssa complained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to find out what's happening to me. You don't have Irena in your head whispering to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I just get visions, guess it wouldn't be the same, would it?" Alyssa said bitterly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura slipped closer to her. "I didn't mean it that way. You've been living with your visions for years. I don't have your experience to keep me grounded."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, yeah, alright, I'll go get us a room somewhere and then come back, see if you want a break or something," Alyssa slouched away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about us?" Brin asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, you could go with her, unless you like libraries?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm going to go find Rabat," Jolrath stated. He turned and headed toward the stairs to the main floor. "I'll come fine you later and find out where we're going to stay."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I'll go with Jolrath, thanks anyway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura watched Alyssa walk slowly down the stairs and almost ran to catch up. At the last minute she turned to Lyrillan instead. "Could you show me to the library?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She'll be back. Give her a little while to realize how hard this must be for you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The library was deeper into the adminstrative building. Large doors stood open at the end of the long blacony. Inside close crowded shelves held parchments, manuscripts, and bound books. Several people moved among the shelves returning items or pulling others out. A table faced the door with a white haired old man seated behind it. "Darius, have you seen Marsa? This young lady needs a pass for the stacks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In her office last I checked," Darius replied, hardly looking up from the tome he was studying.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lyrillan turned around, walked out to the balcony and followed it around to the right. At a small, plain wooden door she stopped and knocked. When a voice called she opened it and motioned Laura in. A tall black skinned woman with white hair and red eyes looked up from a grouping of gems. "Lyrillan."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Marsa, this is Laura. Sharyl authorized a stacks pass for her. She wishes to study the sections relating to Kaltereth."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kaltereth?" Marsa reached into a drawer and pulled out an amulet on a silver chain. She closed her eyes, moved her fingers in an intricate pattern over the surface of it, and handed it to Laura. "This will let you past the wards and into the stacks. It will not allow you to take any item out of the library area, but you will be able to take them to various tables and study nooks within the library. It will glow green when you are near items relating to your subject."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you," Laura replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you need me for anything else?" Lyrillan asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, thank you." Laura returned to the library and began hunting.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two hours later she was in a study nook with several large tomes opened in front of her. She was so deeply focused that she didn't notice the shadow standing near her for the first moments. "Do you have a few moments?" a voice asked. She looked up to find the mistress of the school looking down at her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please," Laura motioned to the other chair.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am Sharyl. Are you finding what you need?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure. I'm finding studies of her theories and ideas, but nothing about her. I was hoping to know more about the woman since I don't have the magical knowledge to understand her works."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, I'm afraid you won't find much here about her. She kept herself distant from most people. However, I can tell you a bit about her. Kaltereth was born and raised by a family of hunters near Delgakar. She might have never studied magic if it hadn't been for a friend of hers wanting company on the trip here to begin his own studies. Something about the school drew her in and she applied when he did. She showed an apptitude we rarely see in beginning students and she was accepted. She was a quiet woman, withdrawn and distant with many of her peers, but she was brilliant when it came to the understanding of magical theory. She was doing advanced work by her third year and was on an independent study program after that. When I introduced her to the theories of Tesch Mar in one of my sessions with her, she made them her focus. Once her formal training was completed she headed out to explore some of her own ideas. She would disappear for months sometimes, returning with books full of new notes and concepts. You have some of those in your stack. A couple of years before the Hell Gate Wars she came back from one of her trips even more excited than usual. She had met Margla Fleshfeaster and had not only survived the meeting, but considered Margla a friend. At first I thought she was mistaken until she showed me a theory about the combining of ancient magic and arcane magic. Then I knew she was telling the truth."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Fleshfeaster has magic that has kept her alive far beyond the alloted years. I studied under her at the great school of magic at School of Magic on Trilbarash at the Great Well of Worlds when she was the headmistress there. She had mentioned theories about that concept then, although he didn't give any of us details. Kaltereth remained in contact with the Fleshfeaster until the Hell Gate Wars. After the wars she found Tesch Mar's tower, although she never said where it was. She was nervous, uncertain, and mentioned someone watching her. I saw her a few more times and then nothing. I sent out search parties but no one found her. You have her key, maybe that will help you find her. If you do, please ask her to come see me. I miss her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will. Thank you for taking time to talk to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like to ask you something. You've been here for a while, according to Darius, and you've had these books for that time. How much of them do you understand?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing really. I'm not an arcane."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then why haven't you put them back? Why are you still studying them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura blushed as she answered, "I keep thinking if I look at it just a bit longer it will make sense. Some of it seems so...almost intuitive...like I should already know it, even though I don't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't you? How did you know about the egg?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I just knew...like I knew the codes to get here, and to get to...home... Are you trying to tell me Kaltereth is in my head?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I don't think that's the case. It can be, but you aren't showing the signs. No, I think she planted data in the key, data that would trigger if a relative contacted it. It's interesting that it is almost invisible to everyone but you. I've told you about a friend, would you mind telling me a bit about yours?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alyssa, right? I haven't known the others long." At Sharyl's nod she continued, "Alyssa is the daughter of the inn keeper in Stratmore-Upon-Comcrash. For as long as I've known her she's been restless and unhappy. She's also had visions and premonitions about things, although, mostly small things like stubbed toes or cuts in the kitchen. A few weeks ago she must have started seeing darker things because she seemed scared of something. Maybe it's driving her mad, I don't know. She's the daughter of Luci, at the inn, yet a few days ago she said her mother was in the Hell Gate Wars, in command of the Lotus Empire forces."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is her mother's name?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alucinia Tomarasdan."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hadn't thought she had died. Alyssa is correct. Alucinia was supreme commander of the Lotus forces for the wars. Shortly after they ended she resigned her commision and dropped out of sight. There was talk of her, and some of the stories were pretty bad, but most everyone was sure she had killed herself because of the devastation she had to order. Your friend didn't seem mad earlier, just obsessed. Has she always been this way over Irena?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah. She sees Irena as the ultimate life goal. Irena came to our village, sick and hurt. She was nursed back to health and then left on a quest to help her friends. Rumor says she found great power and wealth. I think Alyssa is more in love with the thought of adventure, the wealth and power are secondary to her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you? How do you feel about it all?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to be with Alyssa. I'll go where she goes because I love her, but I'm not as keen on the adventure part. This past week we've been soaked, almost raped and killed, almost captured for questioning by the Tolaz, and I still don't know exactly what Alyssa is after."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why would the Tolaz want you? By your own admission, you've only been out of your village for a few days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lyss says it's because I have Kaltereth's key."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Has she seen that? Has she mentioned what else she's been seeing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She saw one of the Tolaz, in a vision, near where we were attacked. Only a little bit about a vision of a giant spider thing, that men poured out of, coming to our village, finding Alyssa and her mom, then killing everyone else."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The two of you have stumbled into very dangerous waters. The spider ship belongs to a powerful entity. If he is looking for Kaltereth you will be in great danger. I believe he is connected to the Tolaz in some way as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lyss said the men from the spider ship were wearing the same clothing as the Tolaz guards."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aztol is the name of the man in the spider. He is very dangerous and very nearly insane. For your own safety, I wouldn't mention his name to anyone except your closest friends. You will need to be very careful in everything you do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And now Lyss is out asking around for the River Wind. Is she putting them in trouble?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Probably not. I think the Tolaz want you because of Kaltereth, but why would they want Alyssa?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Someone or something called crystal. At least that's what she said when telling me about the visions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Warn her not to talk about crystal. Aztol is looking for her and will stop at nothing to find her. She is even more of an obsession with him than Kaltereth."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What does this Aztol want these people for?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They know where items of power are and he wants power."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll tell her to be careful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You be careful as well. Be very careful who you take to Kaltereth's tower. Make sure you kow and fully trust them. I'll talk to you again, for now, I need to get back to my duties."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura returned to studying and didn't look up again until Alyssa said, "Hey, I'm sorry I got in your face this morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok. Did you have any luck?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. I found the docks and got us a room at the Failed Mage Inn, but no one knows when the River Wind is expected. How about you? You seemed pretty intent on those books."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sharyl, the mistress of the school, proved more helpful. These are Kaltereth's theories. I did get a few warnings though. She said we don't want to talk about crystal or Kaltereth except with people we really trust. The spider guy and the Tolaz are in some type of alliance and if they find out we know about both, we'll be in deep trouble."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She say anything about the River Wind?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I'm afraid she didn't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You ready to get out of here for a while? You've been at this all day."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am hungry," Laura stretched and stood. They emerged into late afternoon sunlight. Long shadows lined the quad from the school buildings around it. Alyssa turned right and walked up a set of stairs between the library building and another one. They emerged on a walkway clinging to the backs of the buildings. Below them late sunlight glinted on the canals and painted soft gold over the worn and wethered city. Voices and bells called on the canals and between the walkways as people huried home or to the market for the last items for the nightly meal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa continued across the walkway and onto a bridge across the canal. On the far side she took a stairway down to the left and continued to the middle doors in the line of buildings. A sign showing a mage, face down on the street, hung above the door. Inside the common room was full of tables and students. Laughter, cat calls, and drunken shouts crashed over Laura in a wave of sound. Servers dodged their way through the press delivering food and drink and sweeping away empties in a steady dance of motion. A huge minotaur held court at the bar. Filling tankards and glasses as fast as he could while two others helped and a third ferried food from the kitchen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa crossed to a narrow doorway beside the bar and slipped through the cloth curtain covering it. Narrow stairs angled up to a hall leading deeper into the building. At the end Alyssa produced a fancy key, turned it in the lock, and shoved open the door. Smells of cooking wafted in through the tiny window above a spacious bed. A clean but battered small table and actual chair sat near the door and an equally battered old wardrobe sat next to it. "We can get a bath drawn in the room at the other end of the hall, if we want. I asked that food be brought up when we returned, so it should be here shortly. I wasn't sure if you wanted to deal with the mob downstairs. I come from this background and it was making me edgy earlier."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, lover!" Laura pulled Alyssa into a hug. "I'm sorry I was so bitchy this morning." A knock at the door brought them back to the room. Dinner was large bowls of savory stew and fresh crusty bread. A small just of ale and two mugs came along as well. When they were done they put the tray back in the corridor and fell returned to the bed. "There's something I want more than a bath right now," Laura purred as she reached for Alyssa's tunic.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Much later they pulled the tangled bedding straighter and slipped into sleep. Laura's dreams returned to the tower but then changed abruptly.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">A man with violet eyes stood next to her in a room filled with hard metal and blinking gems. A throne-like chair sat in the middle of the room with a young woman strapped into it. The man crossed to the girl, stroked her face lightly and said, "I am going to enjoy what is in store for you. First I am going to bury your intelligence behind a shell of idiocy. Then I will give you terror of magic and technology. That way you won't let your precious father attempt to fix you. Oh, yes, and I will make it almost impossible for you to speak of it, or at all for that matter. I will inject your body with the extracts of various creatures. You will be fast, furios, and deadly. A time bomb waiting to attack anything that threatens you. I will harden you and speed you survive almost anything. And for the last I shall embed a message specially for your father. One last little bomb so you, his darling daughter, will strike him down as the biggest threat to yourself. At last I will squeeze his balls until they pop!" He turned and looked directly at Laura and snarled, "What, are you still here? Where are those supplies you were to bring? Be quick about it!"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Laura stared at the girl until she nodded, then turned and walked on shaking legs to a corridor made of dark metal, in the distance agonized shrieks sounded almost continuously. The sound beat at her senses as she walked down the corridor to another room, opened it, entered and picked up a small box. Her hands pulled several strange hoses loose from it and picked it up. She staggered under the weight as she slowly made her way back to the chamber. The man motioned for her to place the box on a small metal table.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"You will stay," Aztol said as she turned to leave. "I will have need of your skills shortly." He was already at a large console pushing on gems and moving little rods around while the woman in the chair twitched and moaned. With a satisfied sound he turned his attention to the box Laura had set on a small table. It opened to reveal six jars of faintly tinted liquids. Selecting all of them and taking a large glass tube with a long metal spike from another table he drew up generous quantities of each one. "Cast that maliability spell of yours now. The one that prevents rejection of foriegn tissue."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Laura stood motionless until he looked up at her. "Do not block me woman. You would be less use with a Rider Demon attached, but don't think I won't do it."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Laura stalked forward stiffly and cast the spell. As the energies boiled around the woman the man slammed the injection into the viens in her neck. She writhed in silent agony as it burned its way through her blood. "Now a flesh to etherial spell targetted on her head. If you think to kill her imagine one of my torturers peeling the flesh from your body for days. And remember I have enough healing potion to keep repeating your skinning for as long as I like." Silent tears tracked her face as she cast the second spell. He was smiling as he placed the small demonoid against the woman's face. As it eased its way inside he chanted over and over, "Now I squeeze his nuts until they pop, the arrogant prick."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The woman's scream of agony was the last sound Laura heard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura snapped upright, screaming. Alyssa followed her awake, terror clutching her heart. "What is it? You're awake now, what is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Gods, oh gods, nightmares."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You want to talk about them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, just hold me!" Slowly they drifted back to sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was grey and cold in the morning. Fog swirled around the window, smelling of smoke, marsh, and food cooking below. It was thick enough that the narrow canal between the buildings could barely be seen. Muffled voices drifted through the fog, coming from strange angles and with disturbing clarity. Alyssa snuggled closer to Laura and watched as the dim light slowly brightened to a lighter grey.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A while later she slipped from the bed and pulled her clothes on. She eased open the door and descended to the common room. The noise was almost as loud in the morning as it had been the day before. Working her way through the press of bodies to the bar she ordered a couple of plates of fired potatoes and sausages. Moving carefully, she returned upstairs with the food and slipped back into the room. She set the food on the small table and slid back in beside Laura, waiting for the smell of food to bring her awake.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura woke up smiling. "Thank you!" She stretched, slid out of bed, grabbed the food, and brought it back. Pulling on her tunic she sat up in bed and attacked the food. "Have you been awake long?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just long enough to watch you sleep and get the food. Are you back to the library today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I still need to think about all the weird stuff I read yesterday." Silence fell until they had finished the food. "I can't shake that nightmare. I think it might be about Kaltereth, but I don't know how that could be possible. If you're planning to do anything around town I'd like to come, get some air and try not to think too much about this for a while."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can show you the docks, then we could look around parts of the city?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure," Laura answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa led the way down and out to the walkway. "We can't get directly to the docks because of various private islands," she mentioned as she moved off down the walk. Many turns, twists, and partial backtrackings later they emerged at the eastern embankment. Beyond was the bustling dock area. Alyssa pointed to a large building located mid way down the row of warfs. "That's the dock master's office. Traffic from up-river ties up at the northern end of the docks, traffic from down-river at this end, near us. And I checked yesterday about River Wind. The dock master said her average time between Mishrithal and here is four days, longer if they make a lot of stops." Alyssa explained. A few moments later she added hesitantly, "We could take the egg thing to your tower while we wait, if you want..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, we should probably wait. It's almost a half day by egg to get there. I'd hate to miss the River Wind. We should take Brin and Jolrath back home though." They took there time returning to the inn. Alyssa took Laura through some of the shops she had looked through the day before. After they had seen many couples of all types holding hands, they started to as well. Lunch was bits from various street vednors along the walkways back. It was mid afternoon when they asked the bar keeper if he had seen Brin and were told he had gone out with the other lad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They went upstairs to wait for Brin to get back, leaving the door to their room open so they could notice when Brin went into the room across the hall. The two returned after dark with a couple of companions. Rather than disturb them they closed the door and headed for bed themselves.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the morning Alyssa Laura knocked on their door while Alyssa went downstairs for food. "Brin? Are you awake?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A tousled head appeared in the doorway. "I am now. What do you want?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We need to get you back sometime today."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We don't want to go back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't pay you to stay here since you aren't functioning as guides. You'll have to find your own way of getting coin," Laura warned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's fine. We can figure it out. Don't worry about us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They are planning to stay here," Laura explained to Alyssa when she returned with the food. "Do you see them causing us any trouble?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa sat back for a few minutes and concentrated. "I don't think they will. We didn't tell them much did we, other than how to use the egg thing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I'll tell Sharyl when I go back to the library. I was thinking maybe later today, unless you want to do something?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I do, but it won't take more than half a day," ALyssa responded, pulling Laura down beside her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I like this part of adventuring, no having to aviod my mother to be with you." Laura stated as she rolled on top of her lover.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Much later Laura slowly dressed, "You can come with me, maybe see what we can find on Irena in the library as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, that's ok. I don't have much patience for that kind of thing. I'm just going to stay here and rest some more. Don't be all night, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I won't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once Laura was gone Alyssa dressed and slipped out of the room. She found an empty chair in the common room and kept watch on the door. "You should watch more than one spot if your going to watch," a quiet voice said from beside her. "Hi, I'm Ryla, the owner. Is everything to your satisfaction?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes it is, thank you," Alyssa replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Excellent. Most of the students come here for the ale and the pan meals, however, we do have an extensive drink and food menu thanks to the efforts of the kitchen staff."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pan meals?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A thin sheet of dough is baked with a variety of meat, vegetable, and cheeses on top. It's sliced into wedges and served in a pie like manner. It's all the rage with the students. If you want to try something other than student fare, ask one of the servers for a menu, I promise you it has something to interest almost everyone. If you have any questions or complaints, please have someone come and get me," Ryla rose and returned to the kitchens. Puzzled, Alyssa watched her leave, a brief flash of a viosion teased at the edge of her sight and then was gone. By the time she had finished her ale a restless itch had grown too insistent to ignore any longer. She rose and headed for the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Out on the walkway she turned and headed for the less reputable section of town. The crowds changed slowly as she left the more affluent areas and made her way to the working class quarter. She felt a tug at her belt, followed by rapid footsteps running away. She whirled and gave chase to the cloaked figure as it ran down a narrow section of cobles. At the far end it darted right onto a narrow strip of walk dangling precariously above the canal. A door opened and the figure disappeared inside. Alyssa darted after and smashed through the door, flinging it hard against the wall. In the distance she heard running feet on stone coming from the bottom of the staircase just inside the door. She ran down and turned left to follow the sound. Another stone stair led deeper into the rock foundations of this island. At the bottom she turned right and followed again, gaining as she went.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She skidded through a door and into a medium size chamber. A figure huddled against the far wall, panting and gasping, near a large grate in the wall. Dark shadows peered from within. A door slammed shut behind her as a voice spoke from behind the grate,"Please accept our appologies for the deception, surface dweller."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa backed up against the wall and pulled a dagger, "What do you want with me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Our seer has seen the Balance Keeper coming to our aid, yet we did not call her. A great seer from the surface called her. This seer travels with an arcane of great ability. We could almost identify these heros, yet the waters of time are muddy and turbulent in this time of coming storm."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You still haven't said what this has to do with me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Surfacers do not accept us. We need someone who could speak to the Balance Keeper for us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know who this being is and I certainly don't know of this seer or arcane of wich you speak."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yet the time stream muddies around you as if you were a seer of power."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This has nothing to do with me. I am a minor seer, from a small village, seeking a shadowdancer from my village."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shadowdancer, Timedancer watches from the Throne of Bone while the Day Walker dances with the Demonling. The  Daughter of Blades sips tea in the shadows and dreams of the mother she never knew."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fleshfeaster, Teacher, Mother, Consumer, and Lady of Center, Three in One through accident and folly," Alyssa called back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And that is where you are involved, seer," the voice stated from the shadows. "Please consider our plee. We will bring no harm to you whether you accept or decline. You may reach us through young Mara. She can be found on the bridge of merchants between Calder and Ulger." The door opened behind her as the shadows moved back from the grating.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can you find your way out miss?" the huddled figure asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm good, yes I can." Alyssa backtracked to the walkway and then to the inn. She found another chair near the back, and asked for drink and food menus when a server approached. She smiled as she realized Ryla was right. The menu had many strange items available, some spine chilling, some funny.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where did you come up with some of these?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ryla worked at the Cavern of Dark Delights in Jakara. After the wars she came here and opened this place, drawing on her experiences to create a place of uniqueness. She toned some of the selections down."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do you mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shardra, the proprietess of the Cavern, served items that were very offensive to some. Ryla dropped those items from her menus. I workewd at the Cavern for a while as well and came here with Ryla. Have you found something you might like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see you have Blood of the Wilds. I'd like a glass of that, a bnowl of beef and pork stew, and a loaf of that wonderful crusty bread."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Certainly." Alyssa leaned back and scanned the main room. The students were in full swing again, like she had seen every night. Some challenged each other to minor spell duels, others to darts or rowdy card games.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her food and drink arrived and she tentatively tasted the drink. It was better than the batch her mother had served back home, however that batch had been delivered as payment for services rendered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ale flowed like water and more came in as the sun began to set. She remained in the common room after finishing her meal and ordered another drink. It took the edge off the odd conversation in the rock chamber. She played it over again in her mind. The shadows had never said what they expected her to do for them if she did agree. Although their knowledge of her status as a seer was troubling. If they knew, then Aztol probably knew as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was still thinking about it all when Laura came in. Swiftly she rose, waved her over, and motioned her to crowd in on the narrow bench she was sitting on. "How did it go at the library?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fine, good, I looked through Kaltereth's theories and a bit more made sense. How was your day?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A little strange," Alyssa replied and then described what had happened.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Woah, very strange," Laura replied. "What do you think? Can you trust them enough to get more information from them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. It scares me that they know I'm a seer. If they could figure it out that easily, how long will it take Aztol's seer to guess I'm here? They want something, and that is scary, but they might be able to help. Everything is muddy in my visions, but I sensed no malice from them. Mara didn't even take anything when she touched on me. It was just to get me to follow her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess I'd say go with it then. Would you like me to come along or do you think it would be better alone?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alone. I think theyu'd back out otherwise. I can go in the morning, before we want to check at the docks. We can meet here at midday and then go check."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds good, I wanted to go back to the library for a little bit anyway. Now I'm hungry and tired. Can you recommend anything?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The stew was good and you remember the Blood of the Wilds my mom served that one season? Well the version they have here is really good. You should try it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next morning Alyssa set out shortly after sunrise to find Mara. A group of farmers were set up on the bridge, showing shaby winter kept vegetables. Second rate dealers in third rate weapons and equipment had another small area, close to the edge of the slums. Mara slipped up as she was idly examining some of the wares. "Looking for me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come on then." Mara turned and once more led her to the underground chamber. This time there was a chair and a small table pulled up near the grate. Food and wine were placed on it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you care for anything while we talk. Mara, please show our guest the items are safe." Mara took a tase of the various food items and poured a sip from the wine. "What have you decided?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will help you, if I can. What is it you want me to do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is one, she was our greatest leader. She was taken from us by one who has perverted her and the artifacts she weilded. We would like you to determine what is needed to return her to us, either through your own visions, the visions of others, or through contact with the Balance Keeper."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa reached for the wine and sipped a bit to cover her confusion. The wine rolled off her tongue in silky waves. The room faded and collapsed into a bright point in the distance. She drifted above soap bubbles filled with images. Here, a home where a fight raged, there, a pair of lovers, in the distance an enormous bed floated on it. Reclining upon it was a pale woman with an intricate necklace tattoo visible though the thin white cotton cloth she had wrapped around herself. "Ah, you are awake at last. Welcome to the reals of vision. I am Mereret, known as Angelique to many."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where am I?" Alyssa responded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come, sit with me and I will explain," Mereret answered. Alyssa slowly drifted closer. "In this realm, your mind controls what you see and where you are. That is the first lesson of the Vision Realm."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In th library Laura was back at the theory books, staring at the pages, trying to let the little bits sift into her mind. She jumped when Sharyl touched her shoulder. "I have something else I should tell you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The key from Kaltereth, I made it as a present for her. She had founf Tesch Mar's tower and wanted something special to use to enchant the key magic into. I gave her a ring made of a strange mineral I came across in my travels. It has little purple things dancing in it that respond to the mind of the wearer. I think it might have established some kind of link with Kaltereth and now it has the same thing with you. It's the only possible reason that you are having some of her memories."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Does that mean she's still alive? What if she comes looking for her key?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When I knew her she wasn't an evil person. She'd ask you for it back, but I don't think she's alive," Sharyl's eyes grew sad. "I believe Aztol killed her after he forced her to do many evil things for him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean like putting a demon in the head of a young woman?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You saw what was done?" Sharyl hissed sharply.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Some...some of it...yes... He shoved some mix of liquids into her as well, through a large metal and galss arrangement. It come from a bunch of labeled vials. I only saw the labels for a few of them but they didn't amke a lot of sense. It was  extract, then three letters, d n a, and then a creature name. Do you know something about this woman?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She is my daughter. She was...modified...by Aztol to take revenge on a man he thought was her father. We haven't been able to undo all that was done to her. And now, I don't think she would consent to having anything else done to her anyway." Sharyl held herself rigid but a tear slipped down her cheek anyway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry." Laura was going to say more but a younger arcane approached Sharyl and coughed lightly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, Kayleya?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mistress, the seer sends a message for your friend. Her seer is in danger of losing herself in the realm of visions. It is muddying the waters even more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you , Kayleya. Laura, you must go to your friend. I hope you know how to find her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...I think so. She was going to meet some strange beings in a vault below the city about the Balance Keeper."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I might be able to help with that," Sharyl replied. She gave a series of directions to a door in the poor sections. "I think this leads to their chambers. The other thing you can try is to find a petty thief named Mara. She frequents the merchants bridge between the islands of Calder and Ulger. Tell her the mistress of the school sends greetings, that should get her to listen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you." Laura hurried from the library. She didn't see the young arcane shimmer and fade into an older woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The woman wrapped Sharyl in a hug and whispered, "It begins to escalate."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I hope they are sufficient to the tasks ahead."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Even I am having trouble with the distortions. I only hope Mereret is able to maintain focus."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura hurried rapidly through the afternoon heat until she reached the door Sharyl had mentioned. Only a blank wall greeted her eyes. She ran back and forth along the walkway, searching the stretch of wall for any sign and finding none. At last she ran for the bridge of merchants. She prowled along the walkway, looking for anyone that looked like they might be Mara.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finally she headed toward one of the weapons merchants, one who looked like she might have been there the longest. "Pardon me, would you happen to know Mara? The mistress of the scholl of magic sends her regards. I was hoping to pass them on to her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mara did you say? What would the great lady of the school want with that young guttersnipe?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mother!" A voice called in annoyance from behind Laura. She whiurled and found herself looking down at a small girl in a dirty cloak. The girl eyed her up and down in return, "Looking at something?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, are you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, a non-city woman out of her depth. What do you want?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm looking for a friend of mine. She's about my height, dark blonde hair, wearing clothes like mine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This mystery person have a name?" Mara asked in a bored voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alyssa."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You need to come with me," Mara replied in a less beligerent voice. "I think something is wrong with your friend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean?" Laura asked as she hurried to keep up with Mara.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She went into some kind of seer trance and hasn't come out since this morning. Is that normal for her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Normally she only sees when she's asleep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh." Mara turned anothe corner to another stretch of blank brick on the Calder island bacwater canal side. Midway down the narrow walkway she opened a small wooden door and entered it, motioning for Laura to follow her in. Mara led the way to the chamber where Alyssa sat rigid in a chair, staring into the distance with glassy eyes. "She's been like this since this morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lyss? Hello, Lyss, can you hear me?" Laura called. Slowly her eyes tracked over to Laura and squinted, as if she was trying hard to focus, then they drifted away again. "What happened to her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mara said nothing at first, then she reluctantly replied, "The under ones added a potion to the wine to help her see better. Once she tasted it she slipped off into this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We meant no harm, surface one. We only wanted to help her see. It shouldn't have done this to her. We have given this to many surface seers before without any ill effects."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why haven't you given her an antidote?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is no antidote for this. It expands the awareness of the seer, that is all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lyss, Lyss, it's me, Laura. Come on back to me," Laura leaned in and kissed her long and sensuously. Slowly Alyssa's eyes focus on Laura.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Laur, how did you get here?" Alyssa's eyes seemed to focus, then un focus, then focus again in a disturbing cycle. "I saw...oh the things I saw! Spider assails the citadel of the center, seeks the drifter of nothing, and longs for the forbidden realms where the ancients walked." Her eyes focused for a moment, "Laur, why are you here. I was going to meet you at the inn."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's mid afternoon already."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you see now seer-girl? Do you understand?" A voice asked from the shadows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly Alyssa nodded. "I will help you. Do I come here when I need totalk to you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Take this item," A small silk bag was held through the grate by a gloved hand. "When you need to speak with us, unwrap it and we will be able to talk. Keep it covered otherwise, for your safety and ours." Mara took the bag and brought it over to Alyssa. She placed it in Alyssa's hand and carefully closed her fingers around it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Laur?" ALyssa briefly focused again. "I can't stay here. Everywhere I look, I see too many times. When am I? Which is the now and which are the others?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've got you. Focus on me." Laura helped Alyssa up the stairs and out into the sunlight. ALyssa swayed and stumbled along with her as her eyes darted everywhere. "Can you make it to the docks or do you want to go back to the inn?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Docks." They stumbled along, catching nervous glances from the people around them. It took them over an hour to go the thirty minutes it normal would take to get to the north docks. Tied up at the farthest berth was the River Wind. Dock hands were already unloaded her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa moved to walk up the gangway and onto the boat. An older man stood at the railing watching the proceedings. He called to them as Alyssa started up, "Are we expecting you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like to speak to your captain, if I may?" Alyssa called back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry, she's not here at the moment. Is there something I can help with?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The void captain sails the rivers of the ground, but not by choice. Her lover became what she does not know." Alyssa spoke in a strange rythm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think you should come aboard." The man moved swiftly down the gangway and escorted them on board. He led them to the upper deck, back along the side walk, and into a large room at the back of the structure. He motioned them to one of the benches and sat opposite them. "What is this about?" His voice was still warm but now guarded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The void captain is the key to the keeper. I must speak with the void captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The captain will be back in a few hours. It might be best if you waited here for her. I will find someone to wait with you." He rose and walked to the door. He leaned over the railing outside and motioned to someone below. A few moments later a short, medium build woman walked in. Her face was roundish, with almond eyes and dark black hair. Her voice was low and soft as she asked, "Yes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please keep an eye on our guests. They want to talk to the captain, when she returns."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Engineer, keeper of the ancient tech, and one with understanding. You rode the void with the captain and now you shepherd the inner workings of this vessel," Alyssa blurted out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Will, who is this person?" the woman asked through a face gone white.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. She knows too much though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I mean you no harm. I...I can't help it. Nothing stays still anymore. I can see where you've been, where you might go, so many images blurred on top of each other like thin sheets of skin, transparent with oil. I can't make it stop!" Alyssa wailed. "Am I here in Miskaton, or on a trip up the river, or sitting waiting to leave port? It's all mixed together."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura pulled her closer and held her close. "I'm here, I've got you. Close your eyes and drift if it helps..." Alyssa slumped onto her shoulder, her eyes unfocused and fixed on something in the far distance. "I appologize, someone slipped her a potion to enhance her ability as a seer this morning. She's having a very bad reaction to it and I don't know what to do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should get back to the unloading, Will. I can watch until the captain arrives." Will nodded and left the room. "I understand. I hooked up with the captain and everything got turned upside down. I've been confused and uncertain ever since. Sounds the same for your friend. I know I'm not supposed to ask in a magic based society, but would you mind if we swapped names? I hate not knowing who I'm talking to. I am Lynn, the engineer, like your friend said."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm Laura and this is Alyssa. Not long ago I was just another person in a small village. Now, well, who knows..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why does she want to talk to the captain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's looking for Irena Katarya, a woman from our village. Although she came from somewhere else originally."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Time dancer dancers in the void. Where is the Day Walker, the seer of visions, the daughter of the first of the blood feasters? Does the winged woman still fly at dusk?" Alyssa asked from her trance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura and Lynn stared at her, silenced by the strange questions. They remained in silence until another woman entered the room. "Will said we had visitors? Oh, these two again. What do you want?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I," Laura began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Void Captain, where is your lover, the Time Dancer? You are the key to the keeper. I must find her. Everything is comming undone. The Perverter of Spiders draws closer to his desires and none have opposed him. The Center stands under seige and the edges fray at the onslaught." Alyssa pulled her head up and tried to focus. "Where, when, what am I doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You might take her to the school. They might be able to help. She seems to be  seer unstuck from time. Quite a dangerous condition I would think," The woman said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Captain, for all of that, do you know anything about a woman named Irena? She passed through our village many years ago and we would like to find out what became of her." Laura tried.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A shadow flickered across the captain's face. "She disappeared a long time ago. Not long after we left your village." Laura glanced at Lynn and saw a shadow there as well. "I'm sorry we troubled you." She shifted to slip from under Alyssa. Then she helped her to stand as well. "Lyss, come on, we should leave them in peace."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait," the captain said softly. "Sit back down. We were lovers, Irena and I, for quite some time, until we ended up outside your village. Our coming here changed everything. I slid into a dark depression and Irena, Irena was hurt so very badly. For many months she didn't even know who she was. When she finally rebu...started to recover, she was different, like things had been lost to her. We tried to keep things going, but it was too much. By the time we arrived at Safaq in the Lotus Empire, we knew we had to separate. Gods, I still miss my friend. I fell in with pirates and finally made my way back here. Irena, I don't know, some say she inhabits the Hut of the Fleshfeaster now..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Time Dancer, head of metal, heart of flesh, remembers, remembers and weeps in the arms of her bed mates."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you know so much about her, seer, why do you torment me? See where she is and find her for yourself," the captain snarled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa focused and said, "I'm sorry, it's too jumbled. None can see where she is, just glimpses of her throne and companions. Help me find her for you. I know I can, if I just knew where to start."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's just it. I don't know! We were in Jakara, the capital of the Lotus Empire, and were walking near our inn. There was the sound of a deep, echoing chime and she was gone. Shandi and Krystal as well. We searched for days, but there was no clue, nothing at all. It was like they had never been." Tears tracked the captain's cheeks by the time she finished speaking. "Go to Jakara, maybe you can find the trail, I don't know. Talk to the Supreme Commander of the Lotus forces. It's said she had contact with Irena during the Hell Gate Wars."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The supreme commander doesn't know much. She went mad after the war and landed in my village. She is my mother," Alyssa explained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then I don't know what more I can tell you that will help. Rumors fly constantly about the Hut of the Fleshfeaster, but I have no idea how you'd actually go and find it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you heard of an arcane named Kaltereth?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tesch Kaltereth? The arcane with the gate theories? Just that much I'm afraid. Have you talked to the mistress of the school? It's said they were friends."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have, yes. Thank you. Alyssa, we should go," Laura continued. Alyssa looked up and tried to nod. Slowly they left the common room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would welcome you any time you wish to come aboard," the captain called as they walked away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa tried to speak several times on the way back to the inn. She could never quite get the words in order and gave up each time after a word or two. She pulled Laura to a spot at the back of the common room. "Food, need to eat." They ordered and ate in silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Up in the room Alyssa wrapped herself around Laura. "I'm afraid to sleep," she whispered as her eyelids drooped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok, love. I'll keep the nightmares away." Alyssa tumbled into sleep moments later. Her dreams were clear and unremarkable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura slid into sleep a little while later, tunmbling down a dark well to land in a fancy dining room. The young woman from the previous nightmare was slumped in another chair, restrained by some type of invisible bonds. At the head of the table was the cruel man. The woman twitched and awoke, looking around at her surroundings curiously.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The cruel man spoke to the woman, drawing her attention, "Good morning Shandi. Sometimes the old simple spells are the best. Take the "Sleep" spell for example. It is so low powered and ordinary that few use it. Yet if you adjust it just a little it becomes quite useful again. Instant unconsciousness followed by instant wakefulness. None of the nasty drowsiness effects of drugs or poison. The target awakes fully aware and quite often rested as well." His face smiled at her but his violet eyes remained cold and aloof. "Ah, but I am being rude. My name is Aztol. I would like to welcome you to my city, although we aren't exactly in it right now."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Do I know you?" Shandi tried to stand only to find she was help fast to the large chair she was in.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I'm crushed, you mean that..." he struggled with himself before continuing in a strained voice, "your father," the word was almost hissed, "didn't mention me?" He tried to look hurt but he only managed to look annoyed instead.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"No, I don't think he did. Why can't I move? Let me up! I'm no threat to you. Please, just let me go."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Well now," his composure had restored itself. "I actually would have done that. I like to meet the people stumbling through my garden. It wouldn't be friendly not to. Then I let them continue on their way. You could have as well, it's just that as your father's daughter I thought we should talk. I'm sure there is so much you could tell me..."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Shandi struggled against the invisible bonds that held her, pulling and twisting until she sat breathing heavily from the exertion. "Please my dear girl, don't strain yourself. A colleague of mine was quite careful when she cast those restraint spells. I wouldn't want you to muss up that pretty dress you are in."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Shandi stopped and looked down at herself. She was no longer clad in shirt and leggings but instead in a simple white gown. Aztol had insisted that Kaltereth change her clothing while she was asleep. "It's quite lovely don't you think?" Aztol asked conversationally. "It suits a young woman of your beauty so much better than those nasty, sweaty things you were wearing in the garden. I hope you don't mind. I must say though it was rather a chore to fit you. You are so thin for your age. Seems that father of yours isn't a very good parent. Although I'd suspect nothing better of that piece of..." He bit his words off again. "I am truly sorry my dear. Your father and I have had a few disagreements over the years about certain policies. He has made me so very angry."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"What do you want from me? Why am I restrained?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I am going to return you to your father of course. I want you to carry a message back to him."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I still don't.."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">He eyes looked almost sad as he explained, "It is a very special message. One that says I can get at him were ever and when ever I want. I fear you will be the message. But first we must prepare you for your new role. I almost wish... Well, such youth and innocence, it seems such a waste... But the bastard must pay. I will squeeze his balls until they pop! And you my dear young thing shall be the instrument of my message." Shandi shrank back into her chair in terror as she saw the madness dancing in his eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">He stood abruptly. "No, you silly girl, I'm not going to kill you. There would be no enjoyment in that. I have other business to attend to. I shall leave you in the tender care of Kaltereth, the arcane colleague I mentioned earlier." He raised his voice slightly, "Kaltereth, my dear, would you be so kind as to show miss revenge to her new rooms? Thank you. I should like to see her at dinner, properly dressed of course."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura whimpered and moaned but Alyssa slept on, even when Laura awoke and sat upright. She stared about the room for a long while before sleep pulled her down again and dropped her exactly where she had struggled awake from. She was looking down a herself as Kaltereth, hobbling Shandi with magical bonds and moving her into the hall.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">As Shandi looked around the ornately paneled corridor faint shrieks echoed in her ears. "What is that horrible sound?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Aztol captured this ship from Ishra, the Demon Queen of the spiders. She fashioned it from the souls of the damned in her realms. If you live here long enough you can almost learn to ignore it, almost..." Kaltereth answered in her lifeless voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Twisted fuck!" Kaltereth turned a startled glance on Shandi. Her face was twisted into what might have been a smile if there had been more skin to smile with. For a moment a faint flicker appeared in her tired, dim green eyes. "Yeah, I know the bad words too." Shandi said through a defiant grin.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"You just seem so young."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"My father kept me wrapped in cotton and placed on a high shelf. He thought he could keep me safe from damage and the deadly world outside. But I craved adventure, so I fell off the shelf and found a path. I had hoped for dragons and wizards and battles. Looks instead like I found something else. He never understood the damage the shelf and cotton would cause."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I'm sorry girl, you found your way into a blood feud instead." Kaltereth walked slowly along the passageway giving Shandi plenty of time to study the walls and ceilings. It was opulent and fancy. Rich woods glowed with polish and care. Heavy hangings provided spots of color. Various paintings were carefully framed and hung with a precise eye. Most of them were disturbing abstracts of dark and violent colors swirled together in mad eddies. "Aztol painted them," Kaltereth explained when she saw Shandi studying them.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"He's mad you know."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Who?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Aztol. He's like my father, driven by a warped dream of how things should be. They both want to sit in their webs and pull the threads of others to make it happen. But it can't happen. What they want won't work with real people."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Kaltereth turned and hissed frantically, "The walls have ears. Be careful what you say girl!"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Oh, it's not a problem. He knows he's mad and he revels in it. He will return me to my father."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"It's not that simple."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Shandi turned sad eyes to her and replied, "I know. He is going to damage me first. I could see it in his eyes."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Damn it girl, how can you be so calm?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I have a name you know, at least for a while longer it is mine. I am calm because terror has passed beyond what my mind can handle and I am walking in slow motion now. I could have hysterics, I could fight against your spells, but it won't change anything. My mother always told me a moment of silent inspection can tell you more than an hour of conversation. For example I know you will be doing the damage rather than him."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Kaltereth stopped so abruptly that Shandi stumbled into her. She turned and asked through a white face in a very strained voice, "How?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"His mind is too chaotic, like my father's. Now Auntie Stormy, she's like you, calm, deep, an ocean of power waiting to be tapped. Any disturbances are on the surface, waves upon the deep. You will do it for him. What I don't understand is why."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Kaltereth managed a shaky laugh as she commented, "You are scary, do you know that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Yes. Like my mother I am random, mercurial, shifting, and unexpected. It is the source of our strength. Sadly I don't have it down yet. I should have done better with asshole, umm Aztol."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"He's listening to us. You don't want to make him angry."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"He already is angry. I can't change that. It is why he does what he does. It's like you do what you do out of fear and despair. You can escape you know. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but there is always a way out."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I have thought to do that," Kaltereth mentioned slowly as she gave an involuntary glance at her wrist.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"That way is too obvious. Starvation is too obvious as well. Make the other person die for their cause as my father would say."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"He'll kill me if I try."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"You are strong. My mother had visions, mostly as fragments. Auntie Stormy was powerful as well, and my father was mad. I never told mother that I could See. She was always so sad from hers. Too much pain and death. She should have remembered more of the good ones. I See good for you. You will escape and find happiness. I-She will escape as well and find, well, a way...and friends, finally there will be self chosen friends."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"No, no I'm not strong. He offered knowledge and I came running, just like a puppy for food. I had heard the rumors of his madness and still I came. Then when he continued to hold the offers over my head I hung on his every crumb rather than turn away. I have done his dirty work for years now and I'm still no closer to what I was promised. If I were strong I'd have left long ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Shandi cocked her head slightly and said, "Maybe you just need the right reason."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Suddenly the air shimmered and tore. The walls shivered and faded into a transparent grey for a brief moment as the howling shrieks rose to a crescendo. As suddenly as it had begun it ended leaving Shandi staring at the walls around her. "That was so pretty. What was it?" she asked in a wondering voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"We are returning to Aztol's fortress in the other dimensions. He has a palace located outside the normal ways of time. Now there truly is no escape." She stopped speaking as they arrived at a brass studded door of oak. "Here is your suite. I will return for you in time to help you dress for dinner. Your restraints will release once the door is sealed. At least he is letting you be comfortable. Some of his 'guests' he places in the cells below." Kaltereth motioned for Shandi to open and walk through the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Laura, wake up!" Alyssa called as she shook her awake.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura came awake instantly but completely disoriented. Her eyes twitched and shot around the room, "Where is he? Am I safe yet?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Get dressed, we have to go! The Tolaz are going to attack the undergrounders."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh gods, I keep seeing Aztol and Shandy, Sharyl's daughter. I, no, Kaltereth, is part of what was done to her. I keep seeing it every time I try to sleep." Alyssa was hrrying around the room while Laura struggled to claw her way out of the bed. She stumbled to the pile of clothes and fumbled hers on. Alyssa was already opening the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa ran down the walkways toward the Calder island. The doorway was open with charred remnants of a door still clinging to the hinges. The smell of smoke and cooked meat drifted up from the stairwell. Easing in slowly they headed down. The first body was just around the corner from the stairs. It was dressed in black and orange. A little further on was another. In the large chamber several dark skinned bodies and several orange and black clad ones lay in various twisted ways. The grate in the far wall had been blown open and revealed a small room with a narrow passaage leading away and sloping down at a steep angle. Alyssa hrried on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The passage was lit with glowing mosses as it dropped deeper below the city. Water dripped from the walls and slid in a tiny stream down the center of the passage. In the distance the sound of rushing water echoed. "Spread out, they came this way. Find out where they went!" A voice echoed from below. Alyssa slowed, creeping down the passage until she could see around a corner, into a larger chamber. A river ran through the center of it, a narrow dock of stone protuded from near side. Along its edge several orange and black figures watched. Others moved around the chamber, searching for something.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa motioned Laura back up the passage. In the upper chamber she whispered, "I hope Mara got away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should get out of here, before they come back up," Laura suggested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Back in the sunlight she turned for the merchant bridge. While Alyssa searched the crowd for Mara, Laura approached the old weapons merchant again. "Have you seen Mara today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She hasn't gotten up yet, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank the gods. There's been trouble at the place of the under ones. I feared she might have been part of it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mom, what's going on? Oh, you, magic lady. Why are you here so early?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's been trouble at the under ones place. We wanted to make sure you were ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The black and orange guys? They've been hanging around the last couple of days. I've been careful to make sure they didn't follow me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They've been asking questions around here though," the older woman added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why did you call me magic lady?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The under ones say you are the heir of Tesch Kaltereth. They worry that the orange ones hunt you. What sort of trouble? Was anyone killed?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Several orange men and a couple of dark skinned elven looking women."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The spider lady escaped then. Good!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Spider lady?" Alyssa asked as she came up behind Laura.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The seer lady is a woman on top and a spider body and legs. She's the best! You should go back to your home now magica lady. Spider lady said I was to tell you that if anything ever happened to her." Alyssa and Laura looked at each other.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe we should try that place you wanted to go to now," Alyssa said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura nodded, "You going to be ok, Mara? Do the orange and black people know who you are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm ok, I don't think they've seen me, or know who I am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They made their way quickly back to the school, looking over their shoulders and dodging down narrow walkways to see if they were being followed. They arrived back at the administration building fairly certain they hadn't been followed. Inside Laura asked Marsa to find Sharyl for her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several minutes later she came in and asked, "You were looking for me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. We'd like back into the egg chamber please." Sharyl led the way back through her office and to the egg chamber.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She wished them well as Laura headed for the green button and left while they were still waiting.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once the egg arived, Laura entered, sat down and typed in a number. Alyssa settled in next to her and she pressed the green gem. "Now we wait. This journey takes half a day, or that's what I seem to remember anyway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How far away is this place?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Many, many days by foot or horse. Kaltereth never traveled directly before she found this way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa looked around at the featureless interior and asked, "How did she keep from going crazy, trapped in this thing for hours?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think she would study books, scrolls, and the like. We could talk or sleep, although I'm afraid to sleep, ever since those dreams started."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could tell them to me. Maybe it would help." Laura described the dreams and where she was during them. "I think I've seen that place too. I heard those sounds when the spider ship came to our village, the vision that started all this." They lapsed back into silence, starting conversations and letting them die as the time slowly slipped away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just when they thought they could take it no longer the egg slowed and stopped. The door opened onto the now familiar terminal room with a closed door across, however, instead of being a small door, it was a large double door, big enough to slip the egg through with plenty of room to spare.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took Laura's key to open the large doors. On the far side a stone ramp ascended to the left, a huge circular flat black metal door plugged a tunnel continuing away, and another circular door plugged a passage to the right. Laura stared at the black door before saying, "I don't remember where that goes." She slowly walked over to it and touched her key to a small notch. Slowly and ponderously the door ground open. Beyond it a large natural cavern led off into the distance. Laura followed it until she saw light in the distance. Rounding a final corner she looked out over the ruins of a large city. It was burried under centuries of debris and decay.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned around and walked back to the original chamber, touching her ring to the indent to close the massive door behind her. She approached the second large door and opened it with her key. A metal corridor drove straight ahead. Multiple small doors lined the walls and ahead a pulsing white glow lit up the area. Drawn to the glow, Laura walked forward. The passage opened out into an enormous chamber, lined with strange metal projections and devices. Some resembled cargo loaders like she had seen on the River Wind, others bore no resemblance to anything she knew. In the center of the chamber a large bubble of energy pulsed and swirled in multiple colors. Dimly, inside it, could be seen moving shadows. To the right and near the passage a large grey metal device stood. Strange glowing green runes scrolled over a dark grey surface. When Laura turned to look at it she could just see a different distortion in the air that surrounded the glowing bubble in a protective sphere.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"World gate," Laura whispered. "Kaltereth lived above a World Gate. No wonder she was studying them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And a World Gate is?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A portal between places, in Real Space, Planar Space, and the Etherial, if you know how to manage your travel once you step inside. Something is sealing this one, that's what that grey box thing is doing. It was already sealed when Kaltereth was here, that's one of the things she was researching."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Father who is not, ancient sits in shadows deep, seeking ways to old glories. Seals the world, tries obscurity to force the old to be new again. Cannot understand worlds move on, embrace the now for the past is done."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Father who is not?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Father of the demonling is not, her father is two mothers, old in power and wisdom, young in thought and deed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Demonling? What type of demonling?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Young girl with a demon shoved into her headbyr a foe of the not-father."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kaltereth did that to her for Aztol. Her name is Shandi and she is in all my dreams of Kaltereth." Laura turned and slowly left the chamber. Back at the door she closed once more. She turned and started up the stone ramp. It emerged in the side of a narrow stone tunnel which headed left and right. Turning right she walked to where the tunnel stopped at a right angle bend. She inserted her key into a small notch in the angled section of wall across the corner. She turned and followed the corridor to the next corner and repeated the process. Two more corners and a deep, echoing thumb sounded. Between the last corner and the passage to the egg a section of wall slid back and to the right.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The passage ran arrow straight for a distance and ended in a wide spiral stairwell leading up. Two hundred feet up it widened out into an airy marble chamber. Wide windows looked out over the single peak rising from the center of a desolate plain. Mid afternoon sunlight streamed in, pulling rich colors from the intricate patterns worked into the floor. Arcane symbols, fantastic creatures, and strange scenes wove into each other on the expansive floor. An ornate staircase spiralled up from the center of the room, leading to the rest of the tower.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow," Alyssa breathed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah," Laura echoed. She walked slowly toward one of the floor to ceiling windows. As she approached it shimmered a bit and faded, allowing her to walk out onto a narrow balcony durrounding the tower. Hot, almost desert, air puffed by in a lazy breeze. The air shimmered in heat haze over the steep slopes and the deep carved ravines carved into the flanks of the peak.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura walked slowly around the perimeter, staring down at the area around the tower. Away from the sun ruined buildings poked up through centuries of debris. Little fingers laid out in patterns of streets and buildings. "I wonder what that was?" she asked softly. Alyssa shrugged.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura slipped back inside, through another of the strange windows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa started toward the central stairs. "Wait, let me go first. There are many defense items in this tower that will trigger if the key doesn't show up first." Laura walked up the stairs first. The next level was slightly smaller with curtained off areas. The sounds of running water came from behind several curtains. Behind one was a large bath chamber, three others contained spacious bed chambers, and the last was a kitchen and dining area. The next level was work rooms, library, and study. The top of the stairs emerged onto an observation platform.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The mountain sloped up to one side, the plain spread out on all sides, in the far distance was the hint of other mountains. "And she left all this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, to chase Aztol for more knowledge, and that seemed to backfire rather badly. But now that I'm here, I'm not sure what to do next."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would looking through her library help at all? Maybe there's something about the egg things and where they go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Worth a try while we're here." They descended to the working level. Alyssa curled up in a cluster of pillows while Laura walked around the shelves, looking at the various materials presented. It wasn't as complete as the school library, but it had a lot more than she would have expected. She pulled various items out, scanned them, put them back, and moved on. As the sunlight through the windows faded to red she started toward the stairs. "I'm going to watch the sun go down, want to come?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa looked up, startled out of her half asleep state, "Uh, sure." Red painted a far line of mountains, The black shadows in the ravines provided stark contrast to the red hilights on their edges. The breeze had stilled and some of the heat was fading from the air. They stood and watched until the stars came out. Laura slowly edged back to the stairs down. As they descended candles came alive on the walls nearby, casting warm light into the work areas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, we should have remembered food. This is too nice for trail rats," Alyssa complained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We could go out for dinner, but it would be a day trip to the place I remember from Kaltereth."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Eight hours by egg? Must be a really long way away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a place called the Cavern of Dark Delights..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait, I've heard of that, from the servers at the Failed Mage. It's a place in the Lotus Empire, in the capital city."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kaltereth's memories show it to be a multi-location place. It links to several different cities, one is the capital, another is The Machine Ruins, a city at the southern tip of the Empire. So, trail rats it is, I'm afraid."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where did Kaltereth get her supplies?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, that's not coming to me yet. Maybe she went to Miskaton often enough to bring them by egg. I did find some things on the beings we saw in the chamber though. They're dark elves and they live in the under deep, the dark places deep below the surface. Their society is set up as a matriarchy with the high priestess of the Demon Queen of Spiders as their high ruler. This Demon Queen has a domain in the hells that is hot, dry, and baren. Her place of power is a large spider shaped construct that can travel though the multi-verse and is formed from the souls of the damned in her domain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then the Perverter of Spiders, this Aztol, did something to this Demon Queen and now has control of her device."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He has her enslaved by the same thing he used on Shandi. I remember seeing a dark elf immobile in another chair like Shandi was placed in and the same strange helmet-like device was strapped over her head."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do we do now?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sleep, and look at it in the daylight? We could go back to Miskaton, go to Jakara, or, I don't know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They're caught up in something monumental and have such powerful enemies, what can we do that they can't? Why are we involved?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe because you're a seer and I have this key? Aztol will hunt us whether we run or continue."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa slumped a little and walked toward the stairs down. Laura followed her into the largest of the bed chambers. Silenty they shed clothing and slid into the low bed. Laura pulled Alyssa close as and held her as sleep slowly claimed them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Within minutes Laura was plunged back into dreams of Shandi.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"You need to dress now. Dinner will be soon."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I am dressed."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"You need to wear something much nicer even than what you have on now. In the armoire there are many choices."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Ok, but only if you start eating again."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"What's that got to do with it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"You won't be able to leave if you are too weak to do anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Kaltereth gave a harsh and bitter laugh. "There is no escape."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"There is." Shandi reached out and held her hands. "You must believe me. Remember you are strong and we will escape. None of this is your fault. I forgive you. I won't be able to tell you later."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"What the hell are you saying?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Shandi gave her a twisted smile, "I fell off the high shelf and now there is no way to land without breaking. I must give way so she may live."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Who? So who can live?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"You will meet her once I am gone. Now, will this work for dinner?" Shandi held up a blood red gown trimmed in silver that went nicely with her hair and eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Uh, uh, yes, that will work..." Kaltereth answered slowly. Shandi pushed her out of the room, quickly changed, and emerged into the main room again. She followed Kaltereth down the hall to the dining room.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Revenge, you sit here, near me at this end of the table. Kaltereth you may sit next to her."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I have a name."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"It is not relevant." Shandi held her tongue as she dug into the vast amounts of rich foods placed in front of her. When Aztol wasn't as attentive she would slide the best bits to Kaltereth and watch until she would eat them.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I was hoping to begin your preparation, however I find there are other things that must command my attention for the next few days. Kaltereth, you may show revenge back to her rooms."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"She loved you, you know." Shandi spoke calmly but clearly.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Aztol stopped in his tracks. "Whom did?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Mirenda, of the bath house. In the city where you first met the dark warrior woman you abandoned on Mintashri 3."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"You couldn't know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In a voice laced with scorn she replied, "I have Seen you. You are no different than my father. You are users, unable to act for yourselves. You are pathetic."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Aztol grabbed a meat knife and strode over to Shandi. He raised the knife and plunged it toward her heart. She made no move to stop him. At the very last instant he stopped. Fires of madness danced in his eyes as he hissed out, "Very clever girl, but not clever enough." Breathing heavily and fighting for control he turned to Kaltereth. "Take her to the brain scan and secure her. Then bring the stasis box from the vaults. We will begin tonight after all." He stalked from the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Idiot!" Kaltereth snarled.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"He must be angry and he must start tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Idiot child," Kaltereth said sadly. "Will you come? Or do I need to bring you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I will come." Shandi followed Kaltereth as she shuffled out the door. She led the way further down the ornate corridor and then into plain iron steps. The shrieking of the hull became louder as they descended the steps. At the bottom was a plain iron corridoar. Turning left Kaltereth moved along to a heavy steel door. Struggling she pulled it open to reveal racks and racks of blinking lights and elaborate technological gear. In the center of the room were two massive chairs. In one was a ebony skinned woman with white hair. Her fine features were slack and her eyes stared sightlessly into the ceiling. A large cap of clear crystal sat on her head. Within it pulsed and swirled lazy patterns of purple motes.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"My father has one of these."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Aztol stepped around one of the pieces of equipment. "Yes he does. The rat bastard was going to use it on me if I didn't bend to one of his schemes." He motioned to the empty chair. "If you please, revenge. It's easier if Kaltereth doesn't have to put you in for me."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Shandi hesitated as the fear clawed through her iron mask of composure. She struggled with herself for long moments and then walked stiffly to the chair. "Get on with it then. You and my father, spineless fools meddling in a universe where you are irrelevant. You forge your undoing this night. Better for you had you killed me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The dream skipped forward after that. It was a long time later. Shandi had mutated from a slightly thin young girl into a hardened fighting machine. She drilled constantly against Aztol's minions. Late at night Kaltereth would sit with her in her chambers and stare sadly at the silent woman. Shandi rarely spoke, and when she did it was in a clipped, broken pattern, like she had forgotten the structure of sentences. Still, within her eyes Kaltereth could sometimes glimpse the girl she had been, under the fires of pain and madness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kaltereth had changed as well, growing stronger and healthier under tha wtchful eye of her charge. Shandi wouldn't eat unless she did. She wouldn't work out if Kaltereth wasn't with her.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Long after they had established the routine the spider ship jumped again. Kaltereth slid up beside Shandi, where she lay on her simple cot. "Shan, it's time."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Combat reflexes brought Shandi wide awake in an instant. She leapt from the bed, slid into her simple tunic and breaches, and was headed for the door before Kaltereth was fully aware she was awake. They slipped down the halls until they reached a seldom used stretch of corridor. Kaltereth mummbled and gestured, drawing magical energies until a glowing portal formed. "Jump, I can't hold the gate for long."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"You come?" Shandi asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Kaltereth shook her head, "I have to cover for you until he can't track you anymore." Shandi pulled her into a rough hug, held her for a minute, then leapt through the shimmering gate. Kaltereth let it slip closed, then hurried back to her chamber.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Several days later, or maybe months, the images weren't clear, Aztol stormed into her chamber. Two large men followed and silently hauled her from her bed, slammed her against the wall and held her there, her feet dnagling several inches above the decking. "So, you seek to thwart me?" Aztol hissed like n enraged viper. "I'll give you one chance. Where is she? Where is the daughter of the abomination? Only you could have let her escape." She remained silent, trying to still her trembling. "I warned you." Aztol pulled a small spidery thing from a black silk bag. It seemed to fade in and out of solidity as he brought it closer to her. "Meet your keep. This little beauty will keep you from betraying me ever again." He held it to her face and it oozed its way into her skin. Nerves burned and screamed as it passed through them. She screamed and screamed as Azrtol laughed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Screams echoed in the large chamber, snapping Alyssa awake. Laura was arched back, eyes staring , mouth open in violent screams. "Laura," Alyssa called, first softly, then with more force. Laura remained rigid and locked for minutes longer, then collapsed into violent convulsions. Sweat and tears streaked her face as she thrashed around the bed, clawing at her head. Alyssa grabbed her amrs and held her, braving the kicks and bites until Laura's eyes finally focused on her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What happened, sweetie? Where were you?" Alyssa asked as she gently stroked Laura's hair.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kaltereth, I saw what he did to her. She helped Shandi escape in the end and he put something in her. A thing, a spider thing, to control her. I could feel it wriggling around inside her head." She leapt out of bed and ran for the stairs, not bothering to dress.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa found her upstairs digging thorugh the library. Piles of manuscripts, scrolls, and tomes gathered around her until she held up a dusty, cracking parchment. She carefully spread it out on the work table and scanned it. "There, that's it," she said. On the page was a drawing of a tentacled, bloated bodied thing. "Keeper Demon" was scratched below it. "Wait, this can't be right. These are from the Dominium, a completely different realm of the hells. How did Aztol gain control of them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could he have another demon under control?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, maybe," Laura answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did Kaltereth ever manage to escape? If not, how did this ring find its way to your mother?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. Maybe Sharyl does. Do you want to go on to Jakara and look for Irena or go back to Miskaton?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to go on, but I think we should go back. We need more of a chance and that will only come with knowledge. We should try to get that before we stumble into something else."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, back it is." Laura headed down to dress. A little while later they were back in the egg on the way to Miskaton. "When you were lost in the chamber below Miskaton, where were you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know exactly. I was floating between everything, I think. Then a woman from visions came and we talked. She told me about the realm of visions and how too many seers stirred up the seas so none could see. She, Mereret or was it Angelique, is Shandi's lover and they are companions of Irena. This is why I think we are in way too deep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you see anything?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, we talked about seeing and some ideas to make it more reliable, but that's all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They emerged back at the school. Laura, taking another page from Kaltereth, walked straight to the outer door and tried her key in the lock. The door swung open and allowed them to leave. Upstairs Laura settled into a chair in Sharyl's office, figuring she would come to check. A few minutes later Sharyl walked in and Laura smiled at Alyssa.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Back so soon?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We wanted to ask you some things," Laura replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And we forgot to take decent food," Alyssa complained. "Someone didn't mention the place had no shops nearby and I didn't realize how far away it was, even by egg."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I remember Kaltereth coming through here with supplies a few times as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's not all we came back for," Laura added. "We seem to be more and more involved with very high power things but we know nothing about them. There's Aztol, there's some ancient being, hiding in a web of schemes, Irena and Shandi and another named Mereret or Angelique, and then us. We fought off a small bandit attack, but that was a near thing. Why are we involved with the plans of the powerful and dangerous?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The usual I'm afraid. Wrong place, wrong time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did Kaltereth escape Aztol? How did her ring find its way to my mother? Do you know anything else about this?" Laura asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I believe she did. Somehow her ring made it into the hands of a young arcane on a small island at the end of the Free Islands, south of the Lotus Empire. He claimed she had given it to him and geased hime to find the tower. I didn't have a chance to verify his story before he was killed in a brawl in the Failed Mage tavern. The ring was overlooked in the fight and was given to me by the proprietess of the inn. I remembered Kaltereth had family up river so I ventured there to give the ring to them. I was going to explain it all until I met your mother. She is a very good woman in her way, but she had not the imagination nor the will to understand what to do with the ring as a key. I told her it was from her sister and left it at that. For a moment I wasn't even sure she was going to take it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know what happened between them? She never talked about my aunt. I never even knew she existed until a seer told me Alyssa's mom had given me something from her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A common tale, I'm afraid. Your mother saw her sister chasing crazy dreams and flights of fancy. When she went off to be an arcane she washed her hands of her. Then when she never returned, your mother's fears that magic was dangerous and foolish were realized. She most likely decided you would be better to never think about it. And what better way than to not tell you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But no one in her home village said anything to me either when we would go there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your mother was the solid one. She kept in touch with her family, she honored her parents, married well, and had hard working offspring, at least that's what I observed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What was Kaltereth like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Warm, funny, happy, always ready to stand with her friends. But she was driven too. Her studies consumed her and she applied herself with a concentration few achieve. She was a great tesch and would have been on the level of Tesch Mar himself had she lived longer. I counted her friend, colleauge, and equal. As I already explained, I miss her greatly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She helped your daughter escape from Aztol and he planted a keeper demon in her for it." Laura shook as she said it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wish I could thank her," Sharyl said solemnly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did your daughter end up with Irena?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Irena rescued her and brought her home. She chose to stay with her friends."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who is her father? The person Aztolo thinks is, isn't." Alyssa probed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sharyl smiled thinly, "That's not for me to tell."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know anything about Aztol? Who is he, where does he come frome, and what does he want?" Laura tried.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He's a brilliant but twisted person from a place far over the seas. He started out searching for the history of this world and the magic of the ancients, but when he found it he used it for power. I think his background was harsh so he thought power would allow him to redress the wrongs from his childhood, but, like so many, it made him worse than what had happened to him. Once he got a taste for power, though, he couldn't stop. He wanted more and more, taking whatever he could. He collided with other powerful beings and they fought about his actions and effects. When he lost one of the fights he decided he had to have revenge and set about to get it. He thought my daughter was related to one of his rivals and grabbed her to use as a weapon. He was rather cruel in his actions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura shuddered, "I know. I saw."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She was helped by friends after she escaped. She's still very different from the little girl I remember, but she found love and friendship, so I think she's happy now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you see her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She visits from time to time, yes," Sharyl replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Has she been here recently?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sharyl smiled, "Nicely done. Yes, but they are gone now and I don't know where the Hut went."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're thrown into the middle of this power play and we don't have the skills to survive. Do you have any idea what we can do to live through it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Find the Hut. It is likely the only thing you can do. You have the egg now. I would try Jakara and the books in your tower. Kaltereth met with Margla often, maybe there is a place where the Hut is more likely to be."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa was staring through Sharyl when Laura glanced over her way. "Ancient born, keeper of the sleepers, rock to the trickster's ways, seeks to keep the shadows curbed. Shadow ancient and spider desecrator fight for dominion from the shadows. Opposed by trickster, rock, and keeper of the balance. Trickster and Rock, mothers of the demonling, bane of the shadow dominators."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sharyl swung to face her but didn't say anything. Alyssafaded back into awareness and stared back. "You and the wanderer woman are the mothers of Shandi, aren't you? You walk among us, unseen and watch, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Love of life keeps us here and the desire to not see the two shadow fighters mess up the glory that is the present. You have come far in very little time. Be careful you don't get lost in yourself. The Wanderer nearly did, several times."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why don't you just destroy them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sharyl laughed, "It's not so simple little one. They are powerful and devious. To oppose them head on would be suicide unless you were a god. They need to be dismantled carefully, the webs and threads unwoven and then cut one by one until they can no longer gather their power. Besides, for my lover and I, it is enough to slow their advances, mitigate their damage, and allow the rest of us to live our lives."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's not enough any more," Alyssa stated.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you seen that, little seer?" Sharyl asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, when I was with Mereret."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then it must be for you to do something about it. Maybe you are the ones to take apart the fabric. We wish you well and are here to provide background help. Do you have any more questions?" Alyssa slowly shook her head. Laura answered with a no. "Be careful getting supplies. The Tolaz are watching many places in the city right now. You'd be better off to go to Jakara and get supplies there. The Lotus Empire is a very different place, walk softly until you understand it and be aware that women are in charge there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lyss, to Jakara then, or do you want to chance it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jakara."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura turned and headed back down to the egg station. Inside her hand hesitated over the number pad, "Stop at the tower or go straight to the Cavern and Jakara? It'll be 14 hours if we go directly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa thought for a moment before replying, "Cavern. We have trail rats and we could probably sleep on the floor if we needed to." Laura punched the buttons and the egg slid into motion. At first they were fine, talking and waiting patiently, but as the hours wore on, boredom set in. Too wound up to sleep they sat and sulked, squirmed, and tried to stay comfortable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did they do this?" Alyssa whined.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know! This must have driven them crazy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Should have asked that ancient how she does it," Alyssa complained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That ancient probably uses her magic instead."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, ah well. Think I'll try and sleep." Alyssa slid out of her chair and stretched out on part of the floor. "The vibration's knid of soothing. You should try this." Laura slipped down beside her, stretched out, and smiled as the low vibration loosened tight muscles.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The stopping of the egg woke them. The terminal door opened into a smooth limestone cavern. Kitchen noises drifted down the passage from farther along. Two large women in purple scoop neck tunics and loose, billowing trousers strode into view from a side passage twenty feet up the passge. They carried strange black items in their hands, resembling crossbows without the spring mechanisms. "Welcome to the Cavern of Dark Delights," one said in a neutral tone. "Follow us please."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa and Laura slowly stepped up to follow. The pair led them past the passage they had emerged from, past a huge kitchen, bustling with activity, and up to a large oak door. One of them tapped on it lightly and waited until a muffled voice commanded them to enter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside was a large chamber, outfitted in hanging silks, thick, richly patterned rugs, candles in tall brass stands, and incense drifting in clouds through the air. An imposing woman sat on pillows at a low table. She would have been at least six feet tall if she were standing. A black silk eye patch covered her left eye. Dark, wavy black hair fell over her shoulders and the dark crimson gauzy blouse she wore. Her eyes were so dark brown as to appear black in the candle light. She fixed Laura and Alyssa with a direct stare. "Kaltereth's key and not Kaltereth. Would you care to explain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura explained how she came to have the key and the woman thawed slightly. "If you need supplies, let me know. I can arrange for them without you needing to bother. Kaltereth was a friend, so any assistance I can give to her relatives, I give gladly. Anlise, show them how to enter the cavern and the bypass door that will bring them back. Laura, your key is now enabled to let you back into the egg car chambers. Please try not to disturb the staff when coming and going."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The larger of the two women turned and motioned for them to follow. She led them back to the side corridor the guards had emerged from and then past many doors to a metal door at the end of the passage. "I think you know the drill, use your egg key to unlock this from the other side. Try to be discrete about it, though. One other thing, as a key holder, you can exit and enter through any of the exits. If you leave through the main one you will be given a choice of where you want to go. Most patrons exit back to the place where they entered. You will be able to choose Jakara, Machine Ruins, Gana, or Skellit's Rest."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The door slid silently open, revealing another stone passage. To the right was the kitchen, to the left a rickety wooden stairwell descended through a narrow fissure in the rock, and ahead were sounds of a busy common room. They walked down the passage, around the bend, and stepped into the enormous cavern that formed the common room. It was crowded, loud, and rowdy. Servers were dancing through the crowds with drinks and food. Patrons were arguing, throwing daggers, playing dice, and carrying on. A bard sat on a small stage and sang to the small group of tables nearby that were paying attention. Across the room was the large tunnel exit Anlise had refered to.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey. move will ya?" a voice called from behind them. Quickly they stepped aside while another server emerged with a large tray of food. Alyssa made her way toward an empty table and sat warily on the bench. Laura followed and settled in next to her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are running out of coin. We might not want to order too much," Laura commented after checking her purse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want to do? Sell some things in your tower or try and knock off another group of bandits?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's got to be some wealth in Kaltereth's stuff. She had to be able to afford supplies and magic things."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What can I get for you?" the voice from the passage asked from behind them. Laura turned to see a tall, dark haired man in loose clothing staring down at them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, ale please," Laura answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Same for me." They paid when he returned and stared out over the crowded room. They had almost finished when Alyssa asked, "Trail rats, or should we see what supplies might cost?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's check. I'll look for more coin when we get back. Should we ask about Irena?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess, I'd suspect the owner wouldn't be working for Aztol."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once they had finished with the drinks they returned to the back corridor. Anlise appeared as they neared the office door. "May I help you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We'd like to talk to the owner about supplies." Anlise nodded, slipped inside, and returned a few minutes later to motion them in. Once they were seated the woman asked, "Thank you Anlise, you may go now." The woman waited until Anlise had closed the door behind her, "What would you be needing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We were wondering what fresh and preserved food for a few weeks, maybe a small cask of ale would cost."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Depends, good stuff would be fifteen to twenty gold, poorer quality would be five to fifteen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We will need to come back with more gold before we can order. Thank you," Laura stated.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May I ask a quuestion?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. I might even answer," the woman replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you heard of someone named Irena Katarya? She's from our village and we are hoping to get word of her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Most everyone around here has heard of her. She was a major force in the wars. Not too much has been said of her afterwards though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Has anyone said she might be connected to the Hut of the Fleshfeaster? There are rumors where we have come from about that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are always rumors. Some even say she has attained godhood or become an avatar of a power. But rumors can be misleading. Most anyone in a position of notice atracts rumors."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Knower of the Runes, opener of the Gates of Worlds, from a blood tinged sea did you sail. Shardra Man Killer, what has healed your shattered mind?" Alyssa asked in a distant and toneless voice. The woman had leapt half from her chair, cruel daggers clenched in each hand. Her face frozen in a mask of cold ferocity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Seer," Shardra all but spat the word. "How could I have been so blind? Now that I look I can see it all over you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I mean you no harm," Alyssa said in a normal and very frightened voice. "Sometimes I can't help but speak. It slips past my lips before I even know what it is."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see," Shardra replied slowly, having reached out and touched Alyssa's mind. "Just like Angelique, only you seem more sane. I can see why the Tolaz wants you." She eased the knives back into sheaths and slid back down into her chair. "Still, you might try even harder. One day you could spout in front of the wrong being and not be able to get yourself out of the way in time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura's heart sped up in panic as she started to rise. "Are you..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I wouldn't turn you over to any male, especially that one. I have met his ex-lover. The stories she could tell are enough to turn even the straightest woman lesbian or celibate."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you know of this Angelique seer?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Other than she's insane? She accompanies Irena in the Hut and she didn't come from here. She's an undead of some form, I have an item that tells me, but she can walk in the day. Why, do you know her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've talked to her in visions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see. I'd say you know more of her than I would." She considered for a few minutes and continued, "There is something you might find interewsting though. The trickster, the old woman you met, she and her lover, the mistress of the school in Miskaton helped me when I first arrived."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait, the old wanderer woman and the mistress of the school are a pair?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, and they are much older than you would think. Just as you," she looked at Laura, "have a link with Kaltereth. Somehow you know what she knew, all you have to do is remember it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sharyl is an Ancient. I saw her as a youngling, in strange cities of impressive power."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have heard of them, but I thought they all died or left or something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's the belief. But it might not be so simple. Kaltereth has seen the chambers with the body tubes in the dark places below mountains. Margla told her they were places where people slept for centuries in some type of magical dreaming," Laura added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's one near here with an egg terminal and everything. There's an accessway from the lower sections, in a locked store room that only I have the keys to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Any way we could get a look at those?" Laura asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Follow me," Shardra stood, walked to a curtained opening behind her desk and stepped through. On the other side a narrow passage wound down and ended in a rock wall. She touched a green gem to the right and a section of rock slid up with a whoosh. A glass smooth passageway continued forward to another gem door. Beyond the door a wise balcony circled a huge chanmber. There were four more balconies above them and two below before reaching the distant floor. Every six feet to their left and right a small contoured bed stuck out from a round tube. There were form fitting covers, raised from the bed, over each one and large bundles of tubes ran from the bed back into the round chambers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura slowly approached the nearest bed. A cracked, slippery looking material covered crumbling yellow powdery material formed into the shape of a resting body. Rusty metal tubes, similar to what she saw in her dreams, were held poised over the neck line of the form. Numerous metal pads dotted the upper cover. On the wall to the side of the open chamber a dark glass panel sat above a cluster of small multi-colored gems. A large metal door paralleled the bed, in position to swing shut and seal the tube if the bed were withdrawn on the rails of rusty metal supporting it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are thousands of these in this chamber and two more just like it. Down below, on the main floor, is a large tunnel to an egg station. Half way around each balcony from us is a large shaft and a set of stairs linking each level. On the bottom floor there is a cluster of ancient magic items in rooms that must have been to support all this," Shardra said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Man's Birth Caverns. Kaltereth knew of this. She was working on a theory of Tesch Mar's that some beings came from here and some immigrated through World Gates. Lyss made it sound like you know how to use a World Gate?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I have a device that allows me to do so. It can open a large port, big enough for my ship and crew."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is a sealed gate below Kaltereth's tower. Would your item open that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think so. When I use it, a gate appears where I am. A strange, old man tried to take it from me once. I didn't let him. His mind was twisted, dark, and disturbing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is your crew still with you? Where do you keep your ship?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not that it's any business of yours, but yes and near Machine Ruins."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are the Machine Ruins?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a city at the southern end of the Empire. It's claim to fame is rotting metal monsters, probably ships at one point. Now it's a major port for ships coming up from the Free Islands."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Before we step out into the Lotus Empire, is there anything you can tell us about it that might keep us from getting into trouble?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do not use my true name anywhere outside the back sections of the Cavern. I am known as Ardra in the Cavern. You have seen that I am far from my home, yet many have travelled the multi-verse. I do not wish to be found by any that seek me. I wish to remain healed. As for the Empire, it is a matriarchy, under her magnificence the Calipha Alia ni Sharazar ni Ishala, Gem of the Lotus, Most High Empress of the Light, Defender of the Faithful, Sweet Spring of Bountiful Goodness. She is refered to with deep reverence at all times. To make light of her is a serious offense in the eyes of empirial citizens. Men are not quite second class, but their words and selves are valued less than women. Men should only speak when spoken to in polite society. Expect to be treated with deference and subservience by the men you meet. It is not seemly in upper sections of the culture to treat men as equals in conversation or action. Egos run strong and you will be respected only if you can hold your own against any trying to beat you down. If you remember that, you should get along fine. There is a class system that is fairly flexible and moderated by person achievement or lack there-of. It won't be applied to you as stringently since you will be obvious as outsiders. Mistreatment of a man is offensive. They are considered weaker willed and of lower skills than women, but are not to be needlessly abused. The climate above is dry. Water is a valued and scarce commodity and the heat of the day can be upwards of forty six degrees."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you show us how to get to the egg station from here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shardra started around the balcony, "Oh yes, arcanes are not reviled here, like in so many other places, however, they are viewed with some suspicion, so I wouldn't mention Kaltereth, except in an historical perspective. The only sanctioned religion is the Lotus Sect. There is tolerance for other religions, but blatant disregard of the state religion will cause you trouble. It's a bit complicated but the Lotus Mother, the mother of the Empress, is considered the high priestess of the whole thing. The various functional sections are refered to as the Petals of the Way of the Lotus. There are eight basic petals. Black is the secret police and assassins. Stay clear of these. The red petal is followed by many in the military. Yellow is the elite guards and empirial household. Purple is the color of the main priesthood. Gold is the royal family. Silver is merchants and trades persons. Green is farmers and general populace. And blue is for the scribes, clerks, and organizers. The devout will wear a lotus blossum of their color as jewelry, embroidery, or some other item on their person. Outsiders don't need to join, just be respectful." Her steps took them to a stairwell down and then across the main floor to the large passage beyond.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What keeps the power on for the lights, doors, and eggs?" Alyssa asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, magic maybe? It's always been on since I started the Cavern years ago. Maybe you should ask one of those ancients, next time you see them." Shardra opened the last door into the terminal. Laura pushed the call gem. "Stop in next time you are here," Shardra added as she started back up the passage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside the egg Laura pushed a combination of buttons and muttered, "This one is forty-one hundred."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Each of these stations has a number associated with it. I've been pulling them from Kaltereth's memories, but this one wasn't there. However, the way to get the egg to tell me what the station number is was in them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, so what is your tower?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Four thousand ten, the school at Miskaton is four thousand four hundred and two." Laura entered the number for her tower and the egg began moving. Rather than trying to stay awake they stretched out on the floor and let the vibration soothe them into deep sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura woke as they slowed to a stop in the station. She paced back and forth trying to remember if there was a place Kaltereth kept her wealth. At last she sprinted up the ramp. Once she had the arrow straight passage open she walked slowly along it, examining every bit of the walls and floor. Half way to the stairs up she stopped and examined a section of floor. She pulled her dagger and traced along a four foot by two foot rectangle. Brushing dust from the middle of it she found a small set of stone dials. She stared at it, hoping the patterns would become obvious.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just as she started to stand it came to her. Without really looking she twisted them into the correct places. The stone faded and thinned until a faint whispy image of it remained in the opening. Without hesitation she stepped onto the revealed stairs and descended into a dark chamber. Torches sprang to life as she reached the bottom. A rough cavern held carved stone nitches adorned with various items. In a small alcove a large brass bound teak chest rested under a shelf containing a bizarre statue of a man like thing with six arms. Its skull head was wreathed in flames and it sat cross-legged, revealing cloven feet. Malice radiated from it and the empty sockets seemed to track the two as they moved around the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura approached the corner first, holding her right hand out in front of her. She stopped abruptly ten feet from the alcove and waved Alyssa back. "There's some type of magic here. A trap I think." She backed away and settled onto her hauunches, staring into the distance. At last she rose, walked to a small nitch, pulled out a plain rod of copper, and crossed toward the statue again. Ten feet out she traced a sideways figure eight in the air. A brief flash of violet light leapt from the rod to the eyes of the statue and faded out. Laura walked to the chest, pushed a series of jewels in its top in a random pattern, and lifted the lid. Inside was a large tray with a thick coating of gems mixed together in it. Underneath was a large pile of coin, gold, silver, and copper, all swirled together.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not too organized with her wealth was she?" Alyssa commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. She only valued it for what it could purchase. Looks like she was hoarding for another expensive item. She was always looking for the next bit of information on the magic nodes and gates she was researching." Laura reached into the pile and scooped several handfulls into her pouch. "It's safe now, lets fill yours too." Once the pouches were filled she closed the chest, pushed two gems at the same time, moved back beyond ten feet, and waved the wand at the statue again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Upstairs Laura went immediately to the library and started flipping through the journals on the work table. Half an hour later she looked up, "I thought I recognized the name. Shardra, said to have come from beyond the world gates. I have spoken with her several times but she won't tell me about her past. Judiciously spread coin has revealed the name Ghunayya, a pirate on the Crowded Sea, as a source of information on Shardra. I must try and find her when next I am in Gana or Machine Ruins." She searched through more of the pages, at last shaking her head and looking up again. "Looks like she never got a chance to follow up on that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"All this talk of world gates and immigrants and all is quite fascinating, but it isn't getting us any closer to Irena."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe it is. We know she's in the Hut, and we know the seer Mereret is there as well, along with Sharyl's daughter Shandi. If we can figure out how to locate or track the Hut, we will be even closer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do you track something that can go anywhere and anywhen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When I, when Kaltereth, met with her, it was often in a lonely valley, near the Valley of Experiment where we lived. I saw something else about that, just a minute," Laura trailed off as she started digging through manuscripts again. "What the fuck? Her notes show a small valley not far from our home village. There's a station, ten thousand and three, that leads to an ancient site right nearby."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Must be the old orc caves. Roweana was telling me about strange things in the depths of those caves. One of her scouts reported it after the militia cleaned out the orcs the last time. There was a small indent near a smooth rock wall, kind of like all the ones we've been using."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tomorrow we should give it a look," Laura said through a yawn. "right now I'd like to take advantage of that bed downstairs." Much later they drifted into sleep. Their dreams were disturbing and chaotic, but too disjointed to be really remembered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The morning found them once more in the egg traveling toward home. The station opened into a large grouping of empty underground chambers. Bits of wire, bolts protruding from the floor, and odd metal bits told them ancient magic had once been in the place. Now it was echoes, dust, and stale air. Moving on memory Laura opened a keyed door and walked up a narrow tunnel to a cave in a small cliff. Spread out in front of them was a tiny valley, hanging high in a saddle between several peeks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We must be in the barrier range somewhere," Alyssa commented. "I haven't been here though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura pointed toward a small lake toward the lower end of the valley. "That's where the Hut usually was, in that small copse of trees just back from the water." She started down a winding game trail.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let me, you've never been good at tracking." Laura let Alyssa slip by her. They made their way down to the lake without seeing any recent signs of activity. Laura took the lead up a short trail into the center of the trees. Sunlight dappled a clearing devoid of undergrowth. Only a thick grey-green moss grew over the soil. She walked over to a gnarled and bent old tree and pulled at the dead leaves and moss. Undeneath was a large worn rock with a deep nitch carved into it. She rolled the stone until daylight shone into the nitch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, there used to be a way to call Margla in this stone. It was a large intricately facetted star sapphire that would call the Hut when exposed to sunlight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So all we need is one of these summoning things and we can call the Hut to us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure there isn't one at your tower?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't remember ever having one. It was always here, waiting, when Margla owned the Hut. She still had it when Kaltereth went with Aztol. I suppose I should look though. It would be better than standing here waiting for them to come back." Laura turned to make her way back to the station.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa trailed behind slowly. "I want to go home and see everyone, but I'm afraid I'd call Aztol down on them. Back to your tower, I guess. Unless you want to talk to Sharyl while we are close."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We could talk to Sharyl." They traced their way back to the station, peeking in a few more chambers on the way. In every case they had been stripped to the bare stone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Up in the office they settled in to wait. Quite a few minutes later Sharyl arrived, looking flustered. "Tolaz men, in the school, being overly agressive in 'talking' to my students. They haven't been this bold ever. I really should show you the other way out so you don't always end up in my office."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We did want to talk to you," Alyssa started, almost agressively. "Shardra mentioned your extreme age and that reminded me of a vision or two, miss ancient."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's rather rude to refer to someone as being ancient, it's even worse than 'hey, old lady'." Sharyl chastised calmly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't mean it quite that way," Alyssa backpedalled. "We did want to know how it is that various places still function. What keeps the eggs going, for example?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Magic, I would say."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, and I'm the Tesch Kaltereth in disguise. But if that's all we can get from you , then that will have to be the answer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want me to say? That a team of trained monkeys flies around and maintains the things behind the scenes? Like this was some giant game for the amusement of some crowd of watchers?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean it's not?" Laura asked with a straight face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, you've seen through it. Sure, the ancients are sitting back in a plush theatre watching all you little actors scurry about from place to place, saying your lines, and winding out your lives. Would you believe there are a few skilled beings that maintain the ancient magic to keep the memory of it alive? That it is there so that you can find it and learn about what was in the past. I'm imagining you are finding the eggs quite useful about now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. What would be as useful would be a Hut summoning gem. You wouldn't have one of those around here would you?" Laura asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I didn't even know there was such a thing." Sharyl rose from her chair and walked toward the passage to the station, "Let me show you the other way out. Today, however, I would recommend leaving the city. The Tolaz are watching the school and I don't think you want them to find you." In the station she turned to one of the tapestries on the wall, drew a seven pointed star pattern with her hand, then pulled it back. Behind the tapestry was a gem door and beyond it was a narrow passage. It snaked its way through the foundation stone of the island and emerged on a narrow dock by a tiny canal. A narrow stair led up to an even smaller walkway. "The walkway comes out of one of the service areas for the school. The canal is for kitchen deliveries. Hardly anyone comes near here." She pointed to a small section of stone. "There's a loose stone there, behind it is a nitch your tower key will open." She sllid the stone out on a metal hinge, placed her right hnd inside, and entered the door once it opened. Laura and Alyssa followed her back inside. "You should have one of these," Sharyl said as she pressed a small item into Alyssa's hand. When she looked there was a simple ring with a seven sided stone set into it. She slipped it on her finger and it disappeared from view. "It will let you access these doors even if Laura isn't with you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you," Alyssa said as Sharyl headed back to the school.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She knows so much more than she is telling," Alyssa complained when they were back in the egg.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No surprises there. We know more than we are telling too. Back to the tower or do you want to go to the Cavern?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tower would be good." They settled into a quiet trip, each thinking about the tiny bits they had gotten.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, these ancients didn't all leave. And if Sharyl is an example, they looked just like us. What if they were the sleepers in the Man's Birth caverns." Laura said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They were," Alyssa answered with certainty. "I saw some of that last time I was asleep. Sharyl, she was the designer of those things. Something went wrong though. I haven't seen what, but it made things unfold differently than was planned."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aztol is seeking a book wrapped in cobras. Kaltereth thought it was a history or something explaining the ancients as well as containing keys to their power. Aztol believes Krystal has it. Kaltereth wasn't sure, I think she was certain it was connected to the Hut."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Library of worlds resides within the Hut, overseen by a demon of lust and a demon of destruction. Wanderer and Trickster stole the library of shadows and placed it within the library of worlds. From under the nose of the shadow weaver did they take it. Long has Trickster laughed at her prank. The artificial servant of the shadow weaver has herself become a shoadw. She now lives within the Hut, bringing life to its dead heart. In the center of the Library of Worlds there is a room, hidden by the maze of rooms around it. And within that room lie the secrets of the multi-verse. The cobras sleep with tomes of power, books of shadows, and explanations for the dawn of all things. These serve the Balance Keeper as she ponders the multi-verse from her bone throne."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know, if you can see all this, why can't you see how to find a summoning gem or where the Hut is?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Same reason you can't go out and cast a high level spell, too many missing pieces." Thjey lapsed back into silence until the egg stopped once more at the tower.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura opened the vault and descended. Once inside she began a careful search of every possible hiding place, including emptying out the large chest and tapping it for secret areas. Hours later she put the last items back in place and collapsed on the stairs. "Nothing." Alyssa moved up behind her and started rubbing her shoulders. Laura leaned back into it and sighed in appreciation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It'll come together. We've done better than many. Remember Martin? He came back after years of adventuring with little more than he left with. You have this awesome tower and we have a way of getting places with minimal danger. One of us will find a way to Irena."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, it's just so frustrating. We know what we need, but have no idea where to get it. Ah well." Laura rose and started up the stairs. "I think I'll search through the journals a bit more, see if I might have missed something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa nibbled gently on her neck, "Why don't you do that in the morning? Right now I have more important plans for you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laura smiled, turned, and kissed her deeply. "Lead on!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Morning found Laura once again at the worktable with journals spread out all over around her. Alyssa trudged up much later, still rubbing sleep from her eyes. "How long have you been up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Couple of hours. I haven't found anything yet, but I'm not very far along. I thought I'd start reading at the beginning and see how it all unfolded."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe I should go in to the Cavern and get some supplies. I feel useless here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You aren't useless at all, but this will be very boring. If you want I could grab a couple of these and come along. Keep you company in the egg anyway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, that's ok. You've got the research material here and I can lounge for most of the trip. I wonder if it's the same egg each time or if there are several of them. Maybe I'll check it out. Wouldn't it be great if we could designate one as ours and outfit it with better lounging arrangements for the long journeys?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought I remembered something about that. If I see it again I'll let you know. You have enough coin?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa looked in her pouch, "Yeah, I think so. See you tomorrow morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the egg slowed at the Cavern Alyssa pulled a small bit of cloth from her pack. She wrapped it around one of the chair supports and tied it off. Then she exited the egg and made her way to the private corridor. When she spotted Anlise she asked to see the owner where she explained the order she wished to make. Ardra informed her it would take several hours to get everything together and that she was welcome to wait in the common room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa tried waiting in the common room until boredom set in. She slipped from her seat and walked toward the exit corridor. Part way down it she felt a brief tingle and then rounded a corner and saw four doors. Over each was a label stating where it opened to. She chose Machine Ruins, opened the door, and stepped through. She emerged into bright sunlight from a run down mud building. She was up a slope, looking down on a busy harbor and a medium sized town. Palm trees struggled to survive in the dusty air. In the distance tortured metal stuck up above the water, rusting slowly in the hot air. Birds cried and swung about overhead and the sounds of a market and people drifted through the streets. A faded sign over the door showed a cavern and strange letters made words underneath. An archway to her left led into a dusty courtyard with stable doors across it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She walked down the street, trying to narrow in on the market sounds. It took her several tries to find the right streets to get around the clumps of houses and into the market area. Bright cloths hung near the entrance to the roofed over street where the market was. Inside people sauntered from shop to shop, sampling wares and looking over merchandise.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa slipped inside, drawn along by the crowd. She kept to the center of the street, unable to understand the shouted calls of the merchants or the quieter replies of the shoppers. It took her over an hour to go the distance of the main street. Emerging on the other side she tried to find her way back to the inn. After an hour of false starts and wrong turns she finally found it and entered the dark caverns once more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your supplies are ready for you. I have them assembled in the back," Anlise appeared and informed her. "You can settle up with Ardra on the way back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once coin had changed hands Anlise helped her load the egg and she started back to the tower. No cloth was tied around any of the chairs in the egg she was riding back in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa found Laura asleep with her head down on the work table. She called several times before a sleepy eye regarded her from under tousled red hair. "Back already?" She pulled herself upright, groaning as stiff muscles protested. "What time is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"After dawn. I just got back. It took them a few hours to assemble our order and load it. Would you like coffee?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd love some." Laura stood and stretched before following Alyssa downstairs. Once she had coffe she said, "I found out a bit more. There are codes that can lock and egg, keeping it at a station until it is unlocked. That would be the closest to a private car. As for the Hut gem, Kaltereth did have one. Margla told her to keep it after one of their last meetings. She said she was going away and that Kaltereth should keep the gem to meet the new owners."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"New owners? Is there anything on the why or how of the change?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The only thing mentioned is Margla wanted to escape a curse of some sort. There were no details and no indication if she was successful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did Kaltereth have any other egg numbers? Maybe there are clues there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Two more. One is called Isle of Research but it's flagged as dangerous, with bizarre animals running through a forest around a remote fortress. The owner won't come out, regardless of actions. The other is a Raisilian's home and she doesn't say who Raisilian is. We could go there, but it's a full day of egg time, about twelve more hours from the Cavern."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Unless we have some other clue, I don't know what else to try next," Alyssa answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have this library, if only I had an easy way of finding things in it. There's probably something useful about Raisilian but I'm not even sure where to start."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can help look. Since it isn't magic related, I can look for the name."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That would be great. Anything that looks useful, put on the work table and I'll do the same. Once we've been through everything we can dig into what we found." The rest of the day was spent sorting through the library with breaks for meals and other necessary tasks. After two days they met in the middle of the last section of shelves. An impressive stack of items covered the work table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After a break for sleep they started in on the pile. Alyssa set asside anything that looked too magical for her to understand for Laura to concentrate on. Three days later they took a break to go to the Cavern for more supplies and a meal somewhere other than the tower. Then it was back to the stack.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On the fifth day Alyssa looked up, "Here's something on Raisilian, he was a contemporary of Tesch Mar. I'd say we can move a visit to his place down in priority."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He's mentioned in connection with a Kalyana ni Raisul, a daughter of the sultan of Kharatoum. She went missing shortly before the fall of Kharatoum. Her sister, Nyssa ni Raisul, went missing as well. Let me see, I saw something else about them..." Laura dashed back to the shelves and pulled down another large tome. "Here it is. On Nyssa's birthday a ship with a figurehead carved to look like her was presented to the sultan. He cut his own throat and bled out on the ship. After that it was considered to be a cursed ship and passed from owner to owner for many, many years. That's strange," she said, flipping through more pages, "There's no mention of anyone seeing Kalyana ever again, not even a body was found. Kharatoum fell apart at the death of the sultan and not much later the epic battle between Tesch Mar and Nyigroth happened. That event is credited with the formation of the Galhai Wastes north of the Lotus Empire."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've got one here that links the Hand and the dark forces with that battle. One of the rumors claims someone seeking artifacts came across something totally evil and was turned into the Hand after finding it. It goes on to say the Hand created a magically protected fortress in the Galhai Wastes that is the center of the dark forces activities."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Looks like all this is more connected than the legends make out. Kaltereth mentioned that in one of her journals. 'Devil cursed and demon haunted Akhalt, center of the Galhai Wastes, where power mad sorcerers of yore called down to this earthly sphere a demon from beyond, to their unending sorrow... Akhalt, where the Undying One rules from the Glowing Throne to this very day... doomed, cursed Akhalt, which the very gods spurned, transforming all the realm around it into a burning waste...'. This excerpt was copied from the MageBook of Margla Fleshfeaster at great risk by the scribe Kanayugara while adventuring with the mage Tzilrynor. They were on a pilgrimage for the legendary plane shifter Margla Fleshfeaster. Kanayugara managed a quick look at the book before Margla saw him and cast him from its presence. Such was her ire that the questers were exiled to the Astral Plane. Only great luck allowed their return to this realm. Kaltereth knew of this mage, who apparently had his tower above the dwarven firstholm. Tzilrynor wouldn't reveal his home to anyone, not even Kaltereth, so its location is still unknown."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Hand and Eye of Azeloth, High Priest of the Destructor, seeker for the key to the Door of Imprisonment. Hand and Eye, blasted away in the battle before everything, scattered across the oceans of time, brought forth by the Sun-Fire weapon of the Ancients Nyigroth called forth to destroy Tesch Mar." Alyssa continued in a normal voice, "How many long lived people are there in our world? Sharyl, Margla, the Wanderer, Yara, how many more?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No idea, but things sure are stranger than we're told. And who's this shadow ancient that Aztol's so angry with? How does Irena fit into all this? All we get are more questions, even when we have answers in front of us. Ok, the Undying One, could that be the Hand? I'd imagine something like the Hnad of Azeloth would be a very powerful artifact."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait, I saw something on that, just a minute," Alyssa fumbled through the stacks nearest her. "found it. This is some kind of prophecy called the Ertan Revelations, and some additional notes."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Revelations of the Mystic Blessings of Ertan</p>

<p class="regtxt9">And it shall come to pass that when the world is once again in dire peril from the manifestations of the evil presence, Ertan shall bring forth priestesses, blessed by Him, to lead the faithful.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">These priestesses shall have the mark of Ertan upon them. They shall lead the faithful to the lost artifacts of power and purity. The priestesses shall then take the holy artifacts of Ertan and purify the faithful for the coming battle for the evil presence shall not be defeated without these blessed relics.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ertan shall cause the lost artifacts to be available to this world once again and he shall reveal their places of repose unto the faithful. The Vessel and the Bowl shall be found together but the Orbs have been scattered by the winds of fate and the twists of time. Many and varied are the places of the Orbs and the Quest of Orbs shall be a long and torturous test of the worthiness of the faithful. Yet completed must it be for the evil presence to once more be defeated and contained. Beware for the evil worshippers seek their own lost artifacts and wary must be the faithful lest they be seduced by the evil ones. The Quest of Orbs must be led by a true priestess of Ertan, sanctified by His Mark, lest the Quest stumble and fall. Only a true priestess shall reliably recognize the blessed Orbs of Law.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And this one seems to be something from farther back, maybe the origins of the conflicts?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Prophecy of the Conflict</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The capture of the priestess of the High One kindled his wrath. The conflict continued for 7 days until the Evil One was imprisoned in a place capable of containing and reducing her powers. Her priest was blasted away and the Orbs of Law scattered by the end of the conflict. It is said another priest of the Evil One shall arise and seek to free the Evil One from her prison. A great dark time shall fall upon the world. At this time shall the Orbs of Law be once again findable by a priestess of the High One. She and a band of righteous shall destroy the evil priest and cast forth the Evil One. The Chosen One shall have the holy flower of the High One upon her breast and shall be born of a strong and true peoples. Great shall be her praise for she shall be the savior of the world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And then there's a note scratched next to some of this, marked from Margla,"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Hand must be "killed" with the Sword of Lorsan, which will force him back to his stronghold. Then, before he can fully regenerate his form the Hand of Azeloth must be cut from his body. The Hand of Azeloth looks like a withered, fire blackened left hand and forearm when it is regenerating . This must be destroyed by soaking it in the tears of a cat eyed virgin in a lost holy relic of Ertan, known as the Bowl of Purity. She Who Must Never Be Named believes the Eye of Azeloth must be destroyed in a similar fashion, however she has no idea who might be wielding it at this time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nicely found! Ertan, I found a book about that one around her somewhere. It seemed a bit weird and raunchy, but then lots of religions fall into the obscure. It talks about those orbs and something called the Bowl of Purity."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Book of Ertan - sections</p>

<p class="regtxt9">At the beginning of the harvest season Ertan spoke to Zoam commanding him to construct a Vessel to be consecrated to Him and to hold the symbols of His blessings. "This Vessel shall be a sign of the blessings I have bestowed upon my Chosen People. You shall cause to be carved a Zerym flower from a perfect block of purple jade. It shall be carved in the form of a half opened Zerym blossom. The size of it shall be twice the length of your forearm in outer diameter and the height of your forearm on the outside. It shall be carved to perfection without mar or flaw. Into the center of it you shall fit a ruby center with gold parts coming forth from it. You shall attach to its base a stem of flawless green jade with three leaves, of one piece of jade shall you make the stem. You shall make for it a cover in the form of a dome of amaranthine wood and cover it within with purest platinum and without with purest gold. On the dome shall be a perfectly formed serpent of the size and shape of the next one you see, rearing with the mouth of it open. The fangs of it shall be of diamond, purest flawless white diamond, while the eyes of it must be of purest ruby. The throat of it shall be hollow and extend down the body of it and through the dome lid. The diameter of the throat shall be the size of the thumb of your virgin daughter. The throat shall be closed at each end with purest diamond, exquisitely fit. The serpent shall be of purest gold and of one piece with the dome lid. The gold working of it must not enter inside the domed lid, nor may it touch the platinum of the inner covering, for if it shall My wrath shall be kindled against you. The edge of the dome, where it mates with the blossom, shall be finished with purple jade the thickness of a cured goat skin and fitted without flaw. From the moment of the consecration of this vessel it shall be known as the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You shall build a three sided pyramid of brass rods, the diameter of the wrist of your daughter with the upward point removed so as to support the Vessel. The rods shall be three forearms in length. When the Vessel is ready to put on the stand you shall carve three notches into it to accept the rods of the stand. The Vessel shall be positioned so that the three leaves face the three openings in the stand. From each of the three legs you shall fix copper spikes the length as that of your foot pointing towards the ground. You shall fix two thirds of the way down the three support rods a ring, on each, of purest brass, the outer diameter of which shall be twice the size of your closed hand, the inner diameter the size of one closed hand. Then shall you cover the brass parts with a layer of purest beaten gold.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Next shall you find two poles of amaranthine wood of four forearms in length and the diameter of the wrist of your daughter. These shall be of straightest grain and without blemish. These shall you cover in purest beaten platinum, leaving a space of wood at each end as handles.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You shall carve a bowl of ebony in the form of a lotus blossom. This bowl shall be in the perfect likeness of the lotus and its inside shall have the capacity of ten wineskins, made of the skins of goats without blemish. You shall build this bowl with rings of jade opposite each other in the form of egg shaped rings for the purpose of carrying this bowl. You shall soak the bowl in the purest of oil of olives for two xers. From the moment of the consecration of this bowl it shall be known as the Bowl of Purity.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You shall, on the night of the Full of the Red Moon, take the completed Vessel and carry it into the midst of the fields of grain before harvest. In like manner shall you take the bowl.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You shall the consecrate them to Me. You shall take half a wineskin of the milk of a mother who bore a son on the full of the blue moon, the water of birth from a woman giving birth on the full of the red moon, a wineskin of milk from the Araq-el-mora plant, and the juice of the Ankhara tree fermented and mix them in the Bowl of Purity.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This shall be the order of the mixing. A virgin, recently accepted as a companion but not yet known by her mate, shall bathe and anoint herself with sweet smelling herbs and oils and go into the field in the midst of the night, letting none see her. She shall wear a robe of purest white wool and a scarf of purest virgin silk wrapped over her hair. She shall then remove all garments and prostrate herself before the Vessel. Then shall she take the waters of birth and rub them into the Bowl of Purity, taking and anointing her breasts and loins. Next shall she take the milk of the mother and pour it into the Bowl, again anointing her breasts and loins. Then shall she add the milk of the Araq-el-mora plant and the fermented Ankhara juice.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">She shall the wave then white silk over her head seven times to signal her companion to come to her. He shall have bathed and anointed himself and donned a towel of finest linen. He shall join his mate and they shall stand in My presence naked. She shall stir the Liquid in the Bowl with her left hand while stimulating her mate with her right hand until his seed shoots forth into the Bowl and until he is once more stimulated. Then shall the silk be spread in front of the Bowl and he shall lay her upon it and go into her. The silk shall then be dipped seven times into the Bowl. They shall then fill the Vessel from the contents of the Bowl and anoint the place where the stem joins the blossom and then sleep near the Vessel and Bowl until morning.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The next morning they shall return to you after waving the silk three times. You shall not go near the Vessel until she who was virginal shall have stopped bleeding. Then shall she and her mate return with you, Zoam and your three sons. The One Who Was shall remove the dome from the Vessel and you and your eldest shall take up the poles and pour the Liquid in the Vessel into the Bowl of Purity. Then shall the mate of the One Who Was spread her thighs and remove from within her loins the Orbs of Law which I shall give unto you. The One Who Was must place the Orbs of Law into the Vessel of Blessed Orbs and she shall replace the dome. Only she or those specially consecrated to Me may remove the Orbs of Law and only after the Ritual of Opening and Bringing Forth has been performed. This ritual shall be known only to those specially consecrated.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You shall the take up the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs and the Bowl of Purity, still with the Liquid within it, and bear them back to your people. Then shall the One Who Was show forth the Orbs of Law and all shall drink of the Liquid. All joyous and thankful impulses shall be followed by all.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Each harvest, at the Full of the Red Moon, shall you follow this ceremony. A virgin, recently accepted as companion but not yet fulfilled, shall bathe and be anointed by the priesthood of the Ones Who Were and dressed in a robe of purest white virgin wool and her hair bound in a pure white silk cloth. She shall mix, in the midst of the night, one half skin milk of mothers and fermented Ankhara juice in the Bowl of Purity in the midst of the unharvested fields. Then shall she wave the silk seven times and her mate shall join her. They shall undress one another and she shall mix the Liquid with her left hand while stimulating her mate with her right until his seed shoots forth into the Bowl of Purity and until he is stimulated once more. Then shall he lay her upon the silk and go into her. The silk shall the be dipped into the Bowl of Purity seven times and the couple shall take up a handful of Liquid and place it into the mouth of the Serpent on the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs. Then shall they sleep till morning when they shall wave the silk three times and join you.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Then shall the Bowl of Purity and the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs remain undisturbed until the One Who Was has stopped bleeding. Then shall the Liquid be drunk by all and the Orbs of Law shown by the priestesses and My people shall join in all forms of joyous impulse.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">And it came to pass that Zoam followed Ertan`s desires and the Vessel and Bowl were constructed. And it came to pass that on the Full of the Blue Moon Tara, eldest daughter of Zoam, gave birth to a child and her milk was saved. It also came to pass that Jolan, wife of the eldest son of Zoam, bore him a son and her waters were preserved. One the same day, the day before the Full of the Red Moon, Tery, virgin daughter of Zoam, chose Tobar as her companion and he her. They cleansed themselves and performed the consecration as directed and Tery became the first and high priestess of the Ones Who Were. It also came to pass that the Orbs of Law were found within the loins of Tery.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">And these are the Orbs of Law which Ertan caused to be brought forth from within the loins of Tery:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">1) Ertan is the only supreme deity</p>

<p class="regtxt12">2) you shall not waste the vastness of the world, nor the treasures of it, nor the plants of it, nor the animals of it, nor anything which is of the world</p>

<p class="regtxt12">3) you shall not slay others of your kind</p>

<p class="regtxt12">4) you shall not allow the envy of others to poison your spirit</p>

<p class="regtxt12">5) you shall not take from your neighbor that which is his or that which he needs more than you</p>

<p class="regtxt12">6) you shall strive to maintain peace and harmony amongst all people and in all things.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">The seventh Orb of Law came to be known as the Orb of Direction. It was given by Ertan to lead His people to a Chosen Land of Paradise. We, the Chosen of Ertan, journeyed far to find the Paradise.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">break in underlined text</p>

<p class="regtxt9">And Ertan caused to grow in Paradise great trees which contained rooms and dwellings and platforms. He made for us all manner of fruits and animals in abundant forms to help us and provide us with food. In the midst of the Trees of Habitation he caused to grow a tree containing an inner and an outer room, within the inner room was kept the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs and within the outer was kept the Bowl of Purity. And Ertan appeared to Tery in a dream and instructed her in the Ritual of Opening and Bringing Forth and from that day only the priesthood of the Ones Who Were could bring forth the Orbs of Law. Tery was instructed to perform this ritual on the Full of the Red Moon during harvest and that all were to partake of the Liquid and receive the Blessings of Ertan.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">break</p>

<p class="regtxt9">After the Chosen had dwelt in Paradise some began to fall by the wayside. One of these, Aldacron, sunk so far from the Glory of Ertan that he attempted to take the Orbs of Law for himself. When he touched the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs his hands were burnt black and fell from his arms like leaves from trees. He fled taking with him others who had listened to his evil words.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">And it came to pass that the fallen began to build a city upon the plains outside the forest of the Trees of Habitation. They began to build their city of stone and dead trees and grasses. They built on the plain before the lone mountain.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Generations passed and the Damagers, as the fallen had come to be called, continued to tear up the plains and cover it over with rock and decay. They began to call up the old evil powers buried within the world. Great grew their pride and their hatred of those still living in Paradise under the Glory of Ertan. And their folly grew great and they began to damage the area near the Blessed Lands of Ertan and Ertan magnified their foolishness and caused them to abduct Lyneiya, High Priestess of the Ones Who Were, and several of her acolytes.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">And Ertan permitted the Damagers to take His Priestesses into their city and then His wrath rose up against them. Ertan lifted up His Chosen people and protected them from the wrath He rained on the Damagers. How long His wrath continued is not known but when His Chosen once again walked the paths of the world they were in a strange place. The entire form of the world had changed. When the Chosen were once again on the world, Lyneiya was returned to them and told them only this concerning what she had witnessed, the rest Ertan had blessedly removed from her memory.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Lyneiya speaking to the Chosen, "When I woke I was tied to a block of cold stone in front of which was the Bowl of Purity, beside which was the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs. I saw the others stripped, bloody and laying senseless on the stones of the floor. As I watched I beheld a naked man cut the throat of one of my sisters and smear the blood on himself. That which was left over he poured into the Bowl of Purity. Likewise did he unto the others. And as he did so he began to chant a strange and evil sounding chant. The torches began to dim and a great evil presence began to gather behind the alter. As it began to form into a vague man shape the man with the knife started to carve arcane symbols into my bosom. When he began this the Vessel of the Blessed Orbs gave forth a beam of blinding light from the eyes of the Serpent and it caused the man to fall dead. Then the beam hit the evil and it screamed in rage and threw clods of darkness. The glory of Ertan then lifted me up and bore me back to you that I might continue the order of the Ones Who Were. He has taken my sisters to dwell with Him in the wilds of paradise. He has instructed me in rituals to perform now that the Holy Items have been placed as guardians of our safety and peace. And Ertan spoke to me as He lifted me up in His glory, `Blessed are you for you have aided in the subduing of a great Evil. Blessed shall be you and yours through all time for I shall give you a new home and you and yours shall travel far, spreading to many lands. Your offspring shall be My priestesses for all times and shall always carry within them knowledge of Me. But take care lest you should fall for I shall not hesitate to cleanse this world again should great Evils arise once more. Only the true and pure will survive. Remember and set down for all men My Laws and teachings that your days shall be long and your ways true.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Every harvest shall you perform this ritual: You shall take a virgin offspring of the Chosen People and bind her to a table of darkest oak. You shall mix the colors of red flowers with wine and ground wheat and make a paste of the consistency of blood. You shall contain it in a bowl of clay mixed with goats blood, from a goat without blemish. In the middle of the night of the Full of the Red Moon you shall break the bowl and release the girl who must lay with the first man she sees. She must allow him to go into her and know her and live with him for the next eighty five xers as his concubine/slave even as you must do this upon your return to the Chosen People. After this she may stay with him as companion or slave, or she may join the priesthood, or she must wait three harvests and become a free woman again. The first girl child of this union shall become a priestess if her mother does not. This shall insure the continuation of the order.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">And so upon completion of her narration Lyneiya went forth and lay with Zatol, the first man she had seen upon her return and she bore him a son. She continued to enjoy the company of Zatol even after returning to the priesthood and bore him ten more sons and six daughters who went into the priesthood.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see what you mean. Some type of nature or fertility cult. Weird, but it does coraborate the story of the orbs and the rest. But what does all of this have to do with our original search?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, although I'm seeing notes from Kaltereth scratch in various places about the Balance Keeper. Mostly she hopes the Balance Keeper will help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And I keep seeing Irena and this Balance concept intertwined."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How does Aztol and his group fit into all this though? That's what I don't quite get. He seems to be bent on revenge against the shadow ancient, but that seems outside the dark forces and all the rest."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Spider Perverter assails the Center, seeking the power of the Order Keeper and the destruction of the Unrealized. The Three Greater Powers walk the streets of the Center, not since the dawning of time have the Three convened in council." Alyssa shook her head to clear the vision, "Aztol makes war on the Center, whatever that is."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Center, of course," Laura flipped through more books, "Centrys, the City at the Center of Everything, Nexus, Hub, Connection between the multi-verse, ruled by the Order Keeper, She Who Must Never Be Named. She balances the force of Chaos, the unrealized potential of the multi-verse, and between them is the Balance Keeper to make sure Order or Chaos never gets full control. All three stand against the Old Ones, the Creator and the Destructor, the beings that formed the multi-verse, but would destroy it if they were released and met each other. Margla believed she was linked to She, the Order Keeper, and that her release would reveal the avatar of the Balance Keeper. From the sounds of your vision the three are meeting at Centrys, something the Order Keeper has forbidden through an edict stating all gods must remain outside of Centrys."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So if Irena is the Balance Keeper and Aztol is attacking Centrys, then it all ties back together. And it becomes more about Aztol and his quest for power than the age old struggle of demon versus light."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. Demon versus light is an issue, but not the one requiring immediate attention. And now that we know all this we can't let Aztol have us. That device I see in my dreams would rip the knowledge from our heads as easy as we are reading these books."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are we safe here? Kaltereth was taken by Aztol..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She went willingly, seeking knowledge of the World Gates and he is a smooth talker if you don't know of him. Also, he went increaseingly mad over the years. I think we are safe in the tower, yes. Have you been able to see this tower?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, now that you mention it. I've seen bits of Kaltereth and all, but never here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then his seer won't either. I doubt he has anyone as powerful as you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Flatery, my love, what ever shall I do with it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Take a break from these dusty old tomes and show my some silk sheets and delights?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Done!" They ran downstairs, shedding clothing as they went. Hours later they emerged from the tangle of silk sheets, sweaty but satisfied.</p>
