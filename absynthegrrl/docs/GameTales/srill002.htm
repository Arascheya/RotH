<h1 align="center">Koriana: ch-2</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
drifted awake feeling a sharp pain in my left side. Then snapped fully awake to
find myself wrapped in a bedroll near the embers of a fire. Curled up next to me
was a large bear of a man, an arm thrown protectively over me. When I looked
closer I found he was wrapped in his own bedding, and I was still mostly
dressed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then
came another surge of panic. Megan, I hadn't even tried to warn her that they
might have found out about our job. Then came thoughts of Jan, what was she
going to think? Would anything happen to her?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next
came the memories of how I had gotten here. I had run to the nearest caravan and
charged up to the first person I saw who seemed to be in charge. I don't
remember all of what I did next, but it seemed to involve trying to buy passage,
then rapidly became begging, then promising to do anything as long as I could
leave. Mind chasing itself<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>in
circles I finally fell back into sleep.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I awoke
to a huge paw gently shaking me. The paw was attached to the large man from the
night. Once more he told me his name was Jerris when he saw my confusion. Next
he shoved a huge plate of food in front of me and sat silently while I tried to
eat it. I could only get through about half of it before fear and confusion won
out again. &quot;What have I gotten myself into?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You
promised to be my sex toy for the journey east. Until we reach Tiajuana I own
you.&quot; I started scrambling backwards until I saw the grin spread across his
face and the twinkle in his wide set brown eyes. &quot;Actually that is about
what you offered, but I won't hold you to it. I make it a rule not to molest
women who remind me of my daughters. But, since everyone heard your offer, it
would be best if we let them believe it.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
the first couple of days I was enjoying myself. Jerris scrounged better clothing
for me and taught me how to prepare a good sleeping spot. We carried on our
&quot;affair&quot; with great relish, laughing quietly about it during the
night, after appropriate time in the wagon with many sound effects. We never
slept in it though it was too cramped with both of us. I was quickly accepted at
the fire. A few of the others would make mock passes at me, but made sure Jerris
didn't think they were serious. We also talked long into the nights. By the
fourth night I was crying my heart out over 8 years of pain. By the time we
reached Tiajuana I think he would have cheerfully killed father if he could
have. I found myself wishing he had been my father. The hurt was still there but
at least I could face most of it. Except for abandoning Megan and Jan.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was
Jerris who suggested that I try and find work at the Crystal Gryphon. I would
have stayed with the caravan but they were planning to turn around and head back
to Provlan. He promised to drop by there later to see me and put in a good word
for me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The Gryphon didn't look like much
from the outside, just a large two story wood building, with a sign, located in
a reasonable section of town. A small piece of parchment near the door
proclaimed the need for dancers. I strode in, and abruptly stopped. Behind the
bar was the tallest woman I have ever seen. She was easily 6' 4&quot;, with
black skin and a mane of kinky black hair. As I slid to a stop she said,
&quot;What do you want? We are not yet open.&quot; Her voice was deep and
resounding, easily filling the large common room.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trying
for my best hell bitch attitude, hoping my voice would stay steady, I
proclaimed, &quot;I want to dance here.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
woman looked me up and down for what seemed like forever, until I was blushing
as red as my hair. Somehow I managed to meet her gaze through the entire
examination. Finally she said, &quot;You want an audition? Then strut your
stuff.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
closed my eyes and launched into the best routine I could remember. Three steps
in I knew a wooden puppet was more fluid than I was. I stopped and asked if I
could begin again. When I saw her impassive nod I took three deep breaths and
began again. I put everything I had into that dance, all the anger and pain of
the last 8 years, and all the hope I had left. How long I danced I don't know.
Eventually she called enough and I wound down to a stand-still, trembling from
exhaustion.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Well,
you don't have enough to do the really erotic stuff and your style is so basic I
doubt you could add to the standard repertoire..&quot; Then she gave me a
lop-sided grin I would come to know meant intense amusement or satisfaction and
continued, &quot;but you dance from the soul, and I like your attitude. Here's
the plan, the first week you will train during the day and watch performances at
night. The second week you will train during the day and perform at night. For
these two weeks you will get room and board. If I keep you past that time, I
will re-evaluate the arrangements. Deal?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Deal.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Then
go get your things and we will begin&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throwing
back my best grin I replied, &quot;It's all here, shall we begin?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her
name was Mirenda, but everyone called her Miren. She was an exacting task
master. I have never been so sore or worked so hard in my life. She was never
impatient or cruel, just demanding. Whenever I would start to slack off all she
would say is, &quot;Do you want to dance?&quot; She put together three simple
routines, set to haunting, illusive melodies, to go along with the exercises and
basic drills. The routines were designed to be subtle, yet erotic. As she put
it, something to tantalize rather than bludgeon the audience. Something that was
not seen elsewhere in town.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
days into my training my first costume was ready. Miren had me wear it during
practice and when I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirrors I froze. All the
comments I'd ever heard about my looks crashed over me, leaving me huddled on
the floor, tears running down my face. &quot;I can't wear this, I can't. I can't
do it or the dance justice.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Look,
I know I was hard on you when you auditioned but it was true, as far as it went.
What I didn't tell you is how good you really do look. Yes, your face is angular
and hard but there are ways to hold it that will remove the hardness. There are
also things we can do with your hair to soften many of the angles. And it’s
such a wonderful color. Many of the other dancers try and fiddle with their hair
color, if I see you do that to your head I'll personally break both your hands.
Now, I want you to add an exercise to your daily routines, starting right now.
Go over to the practice mirror and look at yourself. Now tell yourself, 'I love
you. I like the way you look.' You will do this every practice until I am
convinced you believe it. Now, get over here and dance as I know you can.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
first week of performances must have been passable because Miren kept me on, and
even added a small allowance beyond room and board. I was finally getting into a
routine that seemed to work. It was then I realized I hadn't ever seen Jerris
come in and asked Miren about him. &quot;I thought you knew, he's dead.&quot;
The room spun once and I felt a distant thump.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I awoke
in Miren's room, in her arms. I asked why no one had told me. She replied she
thought someone had. I found out he had never shown up the day I arrived. I had
assumed part of Miren's reason for taking me on had been something Jerris had
said. It turned out he had died that day in a squabble with a drunken
adventurer. I spent the night with Miren, I couldn't bear the thought of being
alone. She held me until I finally slipped into sleep.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I
slowly drifted awake I felt the warm security of arms around me which slowly
melted into a sleepy desire. As I snuggled closer I realized where I was. A
surge of blind panic propelled me from the bed and half way across the room. As
I hit the floor I blurted out a confused apology about an urgent need for the
chamber pot. Face burning, I used the pot and hastily excused myself, to start
my morning practice. I was afraid of her reaction, but she never said a word
about it. I, on the other hand, found myself tiptoeing around her, unsure of my
feelings, and the desire I still felt.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the
end of my first month of performances I began to notice that several patrons
were always there for my routines, and would leave when I was finished. The
fourth week Miren came up to me at the end of a performance, hugged me, and
said, &quot;I knew you could do it!&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
months into my stay at the Gryphon Miren asked the musicians to play a new piece
for me and then told me to design a routine for it. I stood there stunned until
she said, &quot;Kori, I asked you what you would do with this music.&quot; I
stammered through a rough explanation of my first thoughts. All she said was,
&quot;Try it, if anything doesn't feel right, try something else. I want to see
a preliminary day after tomorrow.&quot; Then she left. I worked my ass off on
that routine. In retrospect it was pretty rough, but I was so proud of it when I
presented it to her. She watched with her usual impassive look until I was done
and then came the familiar lop-sided grin.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That
was very good! Now dance it again and tell me if there is anything you don't
feel good about.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
danced it again and noticed a rough spot at a transition. She never told me how
to smooth out the segment, she just asked questions that helped me find the
right moves for it. I worked on that routine for the</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">rest of the afternoon while she watched and coached.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
the end of practice I was exhausted but so happy that, without thinking, I
grabbed her and hugged her hard. There was a curious expression on her face as
she hugged me back. Intense desire flared at the feel of her arms around me and
without thinking I reached up and stroked her face. Her look changed to her
familiar grin as our hug turned into gentle stroking and touching, then into
passionate lovemaking. Miren was a consummate lover, tender and thoughtful, yet
aggressive and demanding. She taught me how much fun sex is when it is shared
between caring people. She also helped me begin to accept my attraction to
women. Later she and her boyfriend taught me that sex with a man could also be
enjoyable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
remained sometimes lovers for the next two months. By the end of that time I was
finally comfortable preferring women. That was when she told me I could stop the
exercise with my reflection, proclaiming that I now danced and moved with a
delight and pride in myself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was
at this time that Miren began to ask about my beliefs, saying at times she could
see a calm self assurance that was deeper than anything she had attempted to
inspire. For a while I could think of no belief structure that I had. After
several probing questions I told her of the moonlight and chanting and how I
would occasionally remember it. Many more probing questions revealed that when
she had seen the calm were times when I had been thinking of that scene.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
then began to tell me of the Goddess. What she explained just felt right. The
more she told me, the more I wanted to know. Here was a deity that wanted only
to empower her worshippers. As Miren explained the basic mysteries and beliefs,
I felt a growing sense of peace. Life was to be looked upon as a celebration, an
event to be embraced and experienced. All things were allowed as long as they
hurt</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">no one, including oneself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was
introduced to several other women who belonged to a local coven. It was obvious
I was being evaluated. After several of these meetings I was invited to
participate in an initiation ritual. On the day of the next full moon I was led
into the forest and given several herbs to smoke. I would be left for two full
nights to meditate and find my Spirit Totem, an animal spirit that would assist
in my spiritual growth. The first night I was to merely fast, the second night I
was to smoke the herbs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
first night nothing much occurred other than my starting at any sound I heard.
The second night I had a vision but not of a Spirit Totem. I was standing on a
large, flat, dark surface with my arm around a dark haired woman. The wind was
blowing our hair together and we were laughing. I knew we were lovers, and that
we had just returned from some type of dangerous adventure as part of a special
mercenary force. This image sort of faded into another one. This time we were
sitting in a small enclosure with large glass windows, waiting for something. We
had our right hands wrapped around a small smooth object, holding a small metal
stud depressed. When I saw a group of fighters closing in on us, we embraced,
kissed, and released the stud. There was an incredible flash of brilliant white
light, sort of like the center of a fireball. As the image shifted I knew we had
suicided rather than face capture and torture, hoping to take as many with us as
we could. We awoke on a blanket of sweet smelling grass, staring up at a
beautiful blue sky. I was so thirsty. As I sat up I noticed a large fountain
nearby. When I looked at it I knew I did not want to drink, that I would forget
everything if I drank. As soon as that thought finished I started to say,
&quot;Lover, don't drink!&quot; As I reached &quot;don't&quot; she gulped down a
hefty draught. I curled forward into a tight ball sobbing, &quot;Don't drink,
please don't drink,&quot; brokenly. I heard a voice then, a powerful voice
saying, &quot;Are you so selfish that you would have her be untrue to
herself?&quot; I awoke with tears streaming down my face and an empty hole where
my heart should have been.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
next day an eagle landed in a tree near the clearing where I was sitting. As I
watched her my view shifted to show myself sitting cross-legged in a clearing
staring. Suddenly she/I leapt from the tree branch and soared into the upper
winds. Below the forest spread out in all directions while wind through my
feathers soothed and calmed me. It brought a peace I had not known since my mom
had held me and sung to me as a child. Slowly I lapsed into a dreamless sleep,
to awaken in Miren's arms, being carried to the coven's holdings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I spent
two weeks there learning the basic rituals for holy days, the full of the moon,
new moon, and the flowing of my blood. I was taught simple herb lore for
promoting or inhibiting my fertility. The beliefs concerning birth, growth,
death, and rebirth gave me a sense of continuity and confidence in not having to
fear death any more. I will choose to be &quot;Many Born&quot; next time around,
I like the thought of remembering where I have been. The vision I had in the
forest might have been a past life remembrance, or just an intense
hallucination. I don't know if I am Many Born this time as even the &quot;Once
Born&quot; can sometimes get a vision of a particularly memorable past event.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
death we journey to the Between, a place of waiting and healing between lives.
It is there we have the chance to decide some of the aspects of our next lives.
Often we can choose our sex and when we want to return to living. We can also
see old friends who have died before us, if they are still there. In some cases
we can choose to return with a lover or very good friend.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
next six months passed in a blur. I was dancing several routines each night and
trying to learn more during the day. I was practicing knife and shuriken for
defense. There was a definite group of patrons that came to see me by this time.
I learned how to fend off the passes I kept getting during my breaks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For a
while I had a fairly steady relationship with Natalya after she split up with
her boyfriend. It went on until she found a guy she was happier with. We had
been feeling lonely and for a time found comfort in each others’ arms.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was
as my first year at the Gryphon drew to an end that Talya found her new
boyfriend. What was really odd about him was how he always seemed to bring
things for her when she was performing. Instead of watching her he would sit
back in the waiting area and talk with the other dancers. Most often he was
asking about Talya's old boyfriends.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When he
started talking to me I decided to have some fun with him. &quot;So do you want
to know about her women lovers too, or just the men?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Women?&quot;
he choked out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Why
aren't you out there watching her? I bet there are plenty of men drooling over
her right now.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Our
relationship is based on trust, not just how good she looks&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;What
attracted you to her in the first place then? Did you discuss philosophy, or did
you come to watch like all the other men?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
came to watch, but then I got a chance to talk with her and wanted to get to
know her better.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;So
you get to know her better by questioning her friends. Interesting
approach.&quot; Flustered, he got up to leave. As he stood up I fired a final
shot, &quot;I don't know what your game is but I do know Talya really likes
you.&quot; When I saw a small flash of something like guilt, I couldn't resist
adding, &quot;She broke off our relationship to pursue you.&quot; Completely
unnerved he mumbled something and retreated out front. I practically choked
holding back the laughter until he cleared the door. Funny though he was, I
vowed I'd find out what was going on. Talya and I never fell in love but she had
become a very close friend.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later,
when Miren was dancing, he came back with Talya. As I passed them, to take my
place following Miren, I flashed him a brilliant smile when Talya wasn't
looking. I had the satisfaction of seeing him turn bright red.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
oddness went on for a couple of weeks, though he was more careful after the
night I talked with him. Still it was obvious he had something on his mind
besides chasing Talya. One night, while he was watching her dance, I sauntered
over and sat down at his table. He jerked and started to get up. I looked at
him, smiled sweetly, and said in a low, even voice, &quot;If you get up I'll
cause a scene like you've never seen before. Remember the bouncer is on my side.
So, buy me a drink and tell me what is really going on. Talya's a very good
friend and I'll be very angry if she is hurt.&quot; Thinking to myself how much
fun it can be to play hell bitch.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Look,
Koriana isn't it, I don't have to sit here and take this&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Actually,
if you ever want to see the inside of this place again, yes you do.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Lady,
you have a real attitude problem. I'm just here to watch my girlfriend
dance.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You're
right, I do have an attitude problem, you aren't the first to tell me about it,
and you won't be the last. You know I could always tell Talya about the intense
questioning you've given her friends. I don't think she would like to know your
interest doesn't center on her.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He sat
there assessing my threat for half of Talya's routine, then, &quot;Alright, I'll
tell you what's going on during Talya's next set.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
Talya finished and came over she shot me a really questioning glance. &quot;Hey,
I'm just checking to make sure he's good enough for you.&quot; I got a blush out
of both of them. &quot;Remember you don't have to worry about ME taking
him.&quot; With that she relaxed. Shortly thereafter I left to take my turn
dancing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
before Talya's next set I rejoined them. There were a few moments of embarrassed
silence, which I ignored, then Talya excused herself to go change costumes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;So,
you and her really did sleep together. I thought you were just giving me
shit.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Surprise.
If you don't already know it, she's great in bed.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
looked very uncertain, almost vulnerable as he asked, &quot;Uh, how do I keep
from losing her to ... uh ... to you?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;The
same way you keep from losing her to another guy, you romance the hell out of
her.&quot; He still didn't look any better and I finally took pity on him
adding, &quot;Hey, don't worry, she prefers guys.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;And
you don't?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;No.
Guys are sometimes fun in bed, but I haven't met one yet I'd want to have around
for any length of time. Anyway, you're stalling, what are you really
after?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally
he told me he was Ryan Thomas, of Thomas and Magnusson Investigators. He was
looking for Talya's ex-boyfriend because he was one of the last people known to
have seen Magnusson alive. Magnusson had disappeared while investigating the
indiscretions of a local high noble.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Look,
why don't you just tell Talya what you are doing? Why all this sneaky shit? I'm
sure she would be perfectly willing to help you with anything you want to do.
Better yet why not just level with all of us and get our willing help? You have
to trust someone sometime.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Do
you? Trust anyone that is?” He fired back. We sat in an uneasy truce for many
moments before I finally gave up and stalked off in disgust. Miren caught up to
me as I was headed back to my room. &quot;What's the matter?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh,
I'm just upset at the slime ball Talya's hooked up with. All he's doing is using
her to get information. Every time that bastard comes here he spends more time
trying to get information out of the rest of us than he does with her. She
deserves better than that.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Ryan
Thomas? That's not the Ryan Thomas I've dealt with. I'm not sure I understand
what you mean, no one else has complained and Talya seems very happy with
him.&quot; My skeptical look brought her to a halt. After I had detailed
everything I had seen happening she looked thoughtful and commented, &quot;You
may be right, but I don't remember seeing any of that happening. If it did I'm
sure he had a very good reason. He is a very honorable man and one of the best
investigators in Tiajuana. He is the one who found the person who killed Jerris.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
weeks later Talya was telling me how Ryan was obsessed with finding his lost
partner, apparently he was letting the rest of his cases slide while he pursued
any lead, no matter how illusive, concerning Magnusson.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;You know he was really impressed by you. He hasn't
stopped talking about how you saw through his cover at the Gryphon.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You
don't mind that he used you?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;He's
just obsessed, I can forgive him that. You know, maybe you could help him. Maybe
take on some of his simpler cases so he doesn't lose all his clients.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
don't trust him. I don't see how I could help anyway.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You
don't have to trust him, just help him. Kori, would you at least try? Please,
for me? I can't stand to see what's happening to him, it hurts too much.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reluctantly
I agreed to go with her and see him. He looked wary as I entered his office but
seemed somewhat relieved when Talya told him why I was there. &quot;OK, here’s
the deal, I’ll help you as much as I can but I will not investigate anyone
that works at the Crystal Gryphon. They are my family. If you can deal with that
then I'll help you, for Talya's sake.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our
business relationship started out very strained but as time passed I began to
see the honorable man Miren had spoken of. I arranged with Miren to reduce my
dance load to four nights a week and spent three days a week working for Ryan. I
admit the work turned out to be very challenging, and very rewarding when the
final pieces of a case came together. He trained me enough handle the really
simple surveillance and investigative cases.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four
months later we were on good enough terms that he would greet me as his favorite
dyke, and I would tell him any time he couldn't satisfy Talya, I would be glad
to have her back.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
after my 18th birthday he called me in and detailed a case involving a missing
blacksmith. The case was going to require one of us to leave Tiajuana for an
island several days sail away. He had too much else to do and asked if I could
go for him. I arranged with Miren to take a break for the next few weeks and
prepared to leave.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
night the ship was to leave Miren presented me with two bronze arm bands. They
were 1/4&quot; wide with a small quartz crystal gryphon set into them.
&quot;These are from all of us, to remind you of your family here. Have a safe
trip and hurry home, we love you.&quot;</p>
