<p class="sectioncaption">Things to remember throughout</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tie <a href="../Irendi/irendi_dev.htm">Irendi</a> and Keepers together - <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/sophia_n.htm">Sophia</a> was at university with <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/jsolitaire.htm">Jaimie Solitaire</a> and has a bit of a tie to the Rani Corp as a result. This also ties in with <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/irena_k.htm">Irena</a> and <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/uru_shandi.htm">Shandi Zarev</a> and <a href="../GameTales/urulive/urulive_dev.htm">Uru</a>, although that can't be used in any published works.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Things to consider revising</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Retool - still start in Stratmore with the crew of Ghost Wind arriving from the ice fields. Valen is still damaged and cyberware rebuild is stalled until she is zapped. Once she is, have her and the rest of the Hut crew disappear mysteriously. Margla yanks them from Stratmore instead of Lotus Empire. Kara and the others go on the hunt, trying to find their missing friends. That is what Alyssa's mom is involved in that takes her to the Lotus Empire.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider a different version of this - based more along the lines of the Online Game as a mental proof of concept</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Use one or two "from the world" characters and one "from elsewhere" who used one of the characters in a game she was playing. <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/allyssa_t.htm">Alyssa</a> and <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/laura_s.htm">Laura</a> for the "in world" characters and <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/sophia_n.htm">Sophia Nelson</a> for the "gamer" character. All three are transfered to echo instances of the Hut, with a shadow of the <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/koria_d.htm">Librarian</a> in each.</p>


</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>
<p class="regtxt5">consider placing the inn where <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/koria_d.htm">Koria</a> came from in Medina al-Afyal</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* the Ravenloft Gate should be off the High Valley - Stone Leigh is near Shalish Castle - in the small bump about half way up the right side on the Lotus Continent map */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">42 zeems from Stratmore to Miznyierash</p>

<p class="regtxt9">50 zeems from Miznyierash to Eryetish</p>

<p class="regtxt9">60 zeems from Eryetish to Frenlayish</p>

<p class="regtxt9">92 zeems from Frenlayish to Azkelon</p>

<p class="regtxt9">82 zeems from Frenlayish to the cutoff to Mishrithal</p>

<p class="regtxt9">24 zeems - around lake to Mishrithal</p>

<p class="regtxt5">tube train from Miskaton to Kaltereths tower = 1100 zeems</p>

<p class="regtxt9">200 zms/hr = 5.5 hours by tube train</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Miskaton to junction = 267</p>

<p class="regtxt9">junction to bend = 246</p>

<p class="regtxt9">bend to tower = 524</p>

<p class="regtxt9">tower to cryo pods near Zayir = 1714 zeems = 8.5 hours</p>

<p class="regtxt9">cavern to machine ruins = 1013</p>

<p class="regtxt9">machine ruins to OCTTI = 1340</p>

<p class="regtxt9">OCTTI = 20 hours from tower</p>

<p class="regtxt9">the Cavern of Dark Delights is near there as well</p>

<p class="regtxt5">MMORG for Shandi's company - directive from Jaime/Rani Corp is to keep the tension in at the expense of general players. The Rani Corp goal is to find possible recruits for their own purposes, so they want a game that is directed at activities that would pre-screen for them - attention to detail, curiosity, out-of-the-box thinking and actions, and other signs of understanding the backgrounds presented - this will need refinement in implementation, but the primary idea is they don't care about player numbers, rather about player actions and drives. Every time the gaming company will argue for more generaly acceptable playing styles or approaches the Rani Corp representative - Jaime - will pull them back to the basic premise, as exposed in the game she ran at university.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Remember - conflicts between gaming company and Rani Corp are based on differences of approach. The gaming company is worried about their rep after the release - will they still be seen as a successful studio, will the adult nature of the title impact them, will they be viewed as a failure if the success Rani Corp wants isn't viewed as success by the gaming community at large and investers in particular. Rani Corp is not terribly sensitive to these issues, since their measure of success is very different</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hut - Home 0 - Irena can modify the Domain on the Plains of Concordant Discord because she is the owner of the Hut and the Balance Keeper - she will keep the overall look - high mountains, enormous and ancient ruins, but change the Hut default to a gothic manor instead of the old peasant's hovel</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider using this for seed ideas in one of the Transylvanian cities during the Alt. London sections of Keepers.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I don't know why you wanted to come here out of all the places you could have taken your vacation but take heed stranger. If you thought the gangs that prowl your cities were dangerous then you obviously haven't done your homework on Transylvania. You can't go out at night for fear of running into the blood sucking Blood Leeches or the flesh eating Howlers. You even have to be careful during the day for fear of running into a member of the Stitched looking for some new body parts to create their next member. Nowhere is safe and tonight there is a full moon. The Howlers will be uncontrollable once the moon rises. If I were you I'd hop on the next train and get the hell out of here while the sun still shines.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* REMEMBER */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This takes place in the Irendi world, so Rani Corp and Irendi are in the background, including the end result of their project and the ships back to Z and T</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Alyssa's mom speaks about meeting Irena */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was about your age when Irena and Krystal came out of the woods. It was sunset, the fall chill was in the air, and I had slipped out of the kitchen to calm down after another fight with your grandmom. Two figures stumbled down the dirt track leading up the valley toward the mad hermit's place and the high mountains beyond. For a moment the tales of bandits and worse had me backing toward the door until I saw them stumble. I dashed over to help them and found they were two women, leaning on each other for support. They had dark fine wool blankets pulled around themselves. Dried blood stained their faces and the odd clothing they wore under the blankets. Exhaustion poured off them as the swayed in the night air. The woman on the right took everything in with a direct, penetrating look. She spoke strange words to the dark woman on her left who spoke in halting Lotus Tongue, "We seek a healer. We have seriously injured friends."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I am shamed to say I hesitated for long moments, all my father's warnings playing about stranges, but in the end I replied, "I am an accomplished healer. Show me to those in need."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please hurry," the dark one whispered. "I didn't have enough to heal everyone." They turned and hobbled back down the road.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could stay here..." I said to the dark woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am the only one who can speak to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where are you from? What happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Later, after I rest."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty minutes up the road they turned into a thick copse of trees. In the shadows </p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">/* once after acquiring the Hut Irena helped Alucinia */</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">/* then at the last Hell Gate battle on the Lotus Continent */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I saw Irena again at the final battle of the Hell Gate Wars. Those of us with troups in the battle were meeting to decide the final strategy. It was just a holding action, a distraction, while the Heroes slipped in to seal the Gate, but we did want to minimize our losses. We had just gathered in my tent when Irena walked in. She smiled at me and took an empty chair at the table and sprawled out in a lazy poze.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ilsandia looked her up and down as she settled in another chair. 'I don't remember seeing you. What force do you represent?'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Oh, I haven't been here before. I am a late-comer, representing a usually neutral party. I come to offer assistance.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Assistance? How many warriors do you field? I'm sure we can find a place for you.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Three, counting myself.' Ilsandia looked annoyed and I tried not to laugh while the rest of the commanders looked on curiously.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Irena, you are such a pain in the ass.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'And you'd know it Luci,' Irena laughed. 'Come, introduce me to the rest of your cohorts. We haven't much time until the attack must begin.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Ilsandia is in charge of the largest group of troups. Hers are second only to the Empress special guard that I command. Matriyari commands the horse groups, Marek commands a group of mercenaries from the Free Islands, and Greylock commands a small team of Arcanes. Irena,' I paused and looked at her. She nodded slightly. 'Irena is the Balnace Keeper and current owner of the Hut of Margla Fleshfeaster.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Impossible," Ilsandia scoffed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena leaned forward, eyes hard. "Insult me if you must, but insult her again and there will be a high price."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">""</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">'I offer an arsenal of battle magic. I can hold the center if the rest of you deploy to attack the flanks.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Arogant words, even for the holder of the Hut.' Ilsandia commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Perhaps. Here is what I would propose. You can plan an alternate strategy if I can't hold the center and you can delay commiting your forces until you see which way it goes once the battle is joined."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* omega contingency */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Valen is connected to the keeper, the energy will spill through her link to the Hut and enfold the rest of those bound to the Hut. It will make them almost Powers in their own rights. Part of this will release Shandi's turned off intilect, which has become quite evolved, trying to find ways to communicate past the blocks installed by Aztol. She and Lynn will be gin thinking about the possible end of everything and consider what might preserve the Repository at least. They come up with a very involved tech/majik plan to use the Hut to step outside the entire fabric of the multi-verse, if it begins to collapse around them. This is the "Omega Contingency". The Keeper will discuss this with her sisters and the three of them will agree that it just might work. Once the plan is in place, the Repository itself is moved into the Hut dimension and a portal left in the old facility.</p>
