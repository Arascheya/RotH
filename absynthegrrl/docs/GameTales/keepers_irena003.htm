<p class="pagecaption">Chapter 3</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was late in the evening when Irena pulled into the cheap hotel. She grabbed her bag, the bottle of Aquavit, and paused with her hand near her laptop bag. She had planned to take a break from the chat rooms and social sites when on vacation. Lately the flame wars and snarking had grown and a number of her friends had dropped off the sites. She turned on the TV and tried to find something to watch, however, she couldn't forget the disks in her bag.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After five minutes of the sappy movie, the best thing she could find in the wasteland of channels, she turned it off, fired up her laptop, and slid the first disk into the drive. There were directories filled with image files, hyper-linked text files, program executables and assemblies. On the last disk was an index file, close enough to the top that looked like a starting point, but when she tried a couple of links, they were broken. She waited impatiently for the time it took to copy all the directories to her laptop, then tried again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hours passed while she followed links, read pages, scanned images, and slowly immersed herself in the designs Sophia had been working on. Some of it she remembered from Jaime's tabletop role playing game. Much of it was expanded details and concepts for turning the bare bones of that early campaign into a world rich enough for a massively multi player environment. Other sections contained character write-ups and creature descriptions, linked to sketches, found images, and concept art to help with development.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was four in the morning when she remembered to look at the clock. She was going to shut the machine down when another heading caught her eye. Suddenly she was immersed in the politics and power struggles of the campaign. The tabletop game had only scratched the surface, even after three years of playing once a week. Page after page detailed factions, power brokers, minions, and themes. The deeper she went the broader the scope became, until the final conflicts were being waged on a multi-versal scale, crossing times, parallel worlds, and the planes of existence as defined in many of the various gaming source books on the market.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena looked at the clock again and it said eight in the morning. She shook her head, stood unsteadily, and reserved the room for another night. She called the friends she was meeting and gave a flimsy excuse for a late start, promising to be to their place the next day. She had been planning to sleep, but tossed fitfully for a long while before turning the computer back on and continuing her research.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stomach cramps pulled her away at noon, forcing her to consider the food she had skipped the night before as well as in the morning. Her hands flew to the keyboard first, then with a raw chuckle, she grabbed the handful of fliers the hotel had left in the room. She ordered from the first one that had delivery service.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cheap, greasy pizza in hand, she returned once again to the screen. Twenty-four hours after she had first started reading, she leaned back and stared out at the tiny room. Unexpected tears dripped down her cheeks at the realization that the game was all just a fantasy. Uru, while real, had been a dead place, filled with the ghosts of the past and the hushed echoes of tourists. Very little of the actual research had been made available to the masses, and what places were open to explore were mostly sanitized and safe. The world trapped in her computer was vibrant and alive with possibilities, dangers, and conflicts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She pushed the laptop to the other side of the bed, slid down, and stared at the ceiling until sleep slowly claimed her. Random images from the things she had read drifted through her dreams. Sophia's sapphire was always there, hidden, calling to her to find it and touch it. Every time she did, the air would start to shimmer and her dream would change to a new place. She tossed and turned fitfully, waking up in the early morning light, tangled in the bedding, almost unable to move.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The hotel shower was almost too weak to pound the kinks from her muscles, but it did enough for her to painfully climb into her car and resume her drive. She pulled into Stacy's driveway just as the sun was setting. "I hope you brought something sexy to wear. We're meeting Amy and Tricia at Brochan's for drinks and dancing." Stacy was bubbling enough to not notice Irena's smile was forced and her eyes didn't light up like they should have at the prospect. "Come on, hurry up and change. They're probably waiting already!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Traffic sucked. Sorry I'm running late," Irena apologized.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stacy hauled her into a tight hug, "That's ok. Brochan's will work its magic and you'll soon forget about that ass hole ex of yours and any sucky things that have happened at work. Oh, yeah, a bit of fucked up news. My ass wipe brother has a couple of friends down for the weekend, so we have to share my room until next monday." She darted around Irena, grabbed her bag from the back seat, and started up the steps to the door. The house was a split level one with the entry door half way between the upper floor and the lower. Stacy went up, turned left down the long hallway, and left again, into her room. Irena followed, stopping to take a deep breath before following her in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok, his room always has that funky smell, kind of like him. Couldn't I use your parents room, or are they home right now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, they're home," Stacy said, making a small face, "You're not turning into a lesbian are you? I love your roomy to death, but she's a bit of an odd one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, just your brother has more of that man smell than I like. Beside, Shan's never put the moves on me, ever. And she's bi, just ask her last boyfriend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bi? I still don't get that. Can't she make up her mind?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stace, I've told you, it doesn't work that way. She like people, not genders."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, ok Rena, whatever you say. Now go, get dressed," Stacy gave her a swat as she left the bedroom, pulling the door closed behind her. The room hadn't changed since the last time Irena had visited. Dolls and stuffed animals still crowded the shelf over the bed. Boy band posters clung to the walls, pink lacy curtains framed the large window and the thick pink quilt was perfectly smoothed over the large bed. Scents of lavender, vanilla, and lilac collided in the air, making it almost too thick to breathe. Irena struggled to hold back her coughing, knowing once she got started, it would be almost impossible to stop. She stripped out of her travel clothes and slid into a long black velveteen skirt, tight, laced up, blood red corset top, and six buckle boots, something that would have been tame by Waverly's standards. Stacy looked her up and down when she emerged, almost frowning in disapproval for a split second, before pasting on a cheerful smile. "Still into that dark stuff, I see."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yup," Irena answered, not wanting to get into the old discussion again. "Guess we should get going."</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Brochan's was the local version of what everyone thought an Irish pub would look like. Before Irena had left for the city it had seemed exotic, now it felt ordinary and rather fake. Every table was filled when they walked in. Fortunately, Amy and Tricia had already arrived and grabbed one. Seeing her friends in the same styles they had worn in high school, going to clubs with the same kinds of music, forcefully reminded her how much she had drifted out of their circle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As soon as they were seated a waiter came over for their orders. "Slivovitz, please," Irena added to Stacy's order of Irish Cream. She tried again when the waiter shook his head, "Jameson Limited Reserve?" He shook his head again. "Jameson Gold?" He nodded at that one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Still drinking weird stuff?" Amy asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's nothing odd about slivovitz," Irena replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, big city girl," Tricia added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first drink relaxed her enough that the distraction that had been forced back by the drive returned. Stacy and the others started comparing the guys in the pub while Irena's mind wandered, painting a picture of a very different place. Dark stone walls arched over a rough hewn floor. Smoke hung heavy in the air, thick with the scents of grilled meats, tobacco and other smokes, sweat from many different races of creature, and booming echoes of conversations, shouts of greeting, food and drink orders, and music from a stage in a small pocket cave partway up the far wall. Shadows flickered from lamps and torches hanging from the ceiling, placed on tables, or jutting out from the walls. She was seated at a small table, tucked into a little alcove against one wall. A single candle guttered in the air currents, flickering light and shadow across the top of the dark black liquid she was drinking. Across from her a small urchin girl sat, sipping a bile green colored sludge and smiling with genuine delight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Earth to Irena. Hello, where were you? I've pointed out the same guy four times now and you haven't even twitched your eyes," Stacy hissed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, um, nothing, just more tired than I thought from the drive," Irena responded slowly. She forced her eyes to focus where Stacy was pointing. None of the guys in that general direction caught her eye.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That one. The one in the denim jacket," Stacy almost huffed. Irena looked at the man in question. He was the blandest looking one of the bunch, although he was handsome enough. He could have been a final year student, a law clerk, or an insurance man. "Maybe you are becoming a lesbian," Stacy said with an edge when Irena just looked away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sorry Stace, he just looks boring. I don't see anything edgy about him at all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn it, what's wrong with you? That ass hole you dumped sure was edgy enough. Abusive, drunk, and rude. Is that what you want again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, but I want someone with some fire, some passion, and who isn't afraid to be different."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that some type of comment on me?" Stacy asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. No, of course not," Irena responded, almost too quickly. That actually was what she was thinking. When she had planned the trip home, she'd thought it would help to see her old friends, go to the old haunts, and drool over the boys again. But it all felt empty and hollow. She began to regret having taken an entire week, then told herself if she still felt the same way tomorrow, she'd head back early.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At least get out there and dance," Stacy pressed. Reluctantly Irena hauled herself up and edged through the crowd to the dance floor. Not very many people were dancing, so she stood out both in her darker attire and because she was dancing alone. Several guys tried to join her, but moved away when she ignored them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You didn't even try to dance with any of those guys," Stacy accused when Irena returned to the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not interested," Irena replied. Stacy pointedly turned away from Irena and only talked to Amy and Tricia for the rest of the evening. After five or ten minutes of the silent treatment, Irena rose and spent the rest of the night alternating between the bar and the dance floor. It wasn't the music she particularly liked to dance to, but it was easier than being near Stacy while she pouted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The ride home was spent in strained silence. "We have to share my bed, but don't talk to me until morning," Stacy said when they entered her room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cloying perfume, scented powder, and overpowering lavender scents clashed in Irena's throat and lungs, forcing a short bout of violent coughing. Stacy just glowered until she was finished, silently handed her a box of tissue, and stomped off to the bathroom. She returned a few minutes later in her perfect pink nighty, flopped down on the bed, rolled to the far side, and stretched out facing away from Irena and the room. Irena stared at Stacy for a long time before pulling a pair of sweats out of her bag, changing into them, and slipping into bed. She stared up at the ceiling for a very long time until sleep finally pulled her down into more strange dreams.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Stacy spoke to Irena in the morning, however, she was still distant and formal. She thawed slightly as the day progressed and a bit more when they met up with Amy to go shopping. Once again it proved how much Irena had changed and what her expectations had grown to be. Even the chain psuedo-goth shops weren't available in the local mall.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While Stacy and Amy sorted through clothes, scurried back and forth to the fitting rooms, and chattered on excitedly about the men they'd seen at Brochan's, Irena let her mind wander. She was in a roofed over street market. The murmur and crest of numerous conversations swirled around her. The air was heavy with spices, scented smoke, perfumes, and sweat. Women walked boldly in the bustle, often followed by men carrying bundles and bags. Here and there friends met and chatted at small tables near food and drink vendors. The clothing was a riot of vibrant colors and rich fabrics.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Irena. Irena! Hey, what do you think of this?" Stacy almost shouted in her ear. Irena snapped back into the tawdry mall shop to find her friend standing in front of her in another hideous outfit. It was pink, with little embroidered unicorns, and made of saggy knit fabric and might have looked good on an eight year old. Irena couldn't choke back all of the laugh that rose unbidden at the sight. "Hey! I think it looks great on me," Stacy snapped back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure it does. I'm fashion impaired, remember?" Irena replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, yeah you are," Amy added with real venom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When they headed into the next shop, Irena pulled her cell phone and dialed. "Alex, could you call me back in half an hour?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure boss, what's up?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This vacation was a bad idea. I need to leave, but I want to give my friends an excuse, something like a disaster at work."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure thing. Not enjoying the old haunts?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Realizing there are some places it's better not to go back to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hear you there! Got to go, we're getting busy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rather than follow her friends into the shop, she continued down the walk until she found a book store. She was wondering the aisles, finding a few interesting titles, when Stacey stormed up to her. "You trying to ditch us or something? Too good for your friends now? What happened to you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena started to answer when her phone rang. She made a show of looking down and checking the number before answering it. "Yes?" She listened for a few minutes then ended the call with, "I'll be back as soon as I can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who was that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My assistant manager. Someone disappeared after leaving Waverly's and they want to question everyone that was on duty that night. I'm going to have to head back right away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Disappeared? Why do you work there? Why do you live in that city? It's a dangerous, nasty place!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Because I like it, Stace."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think I know you anymore. Well, come on then. We'd better get you back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The ride back to Stacey's was spent in silence. Their goodbyes were pleasant but distant as Irena climbed into her car and drove away. She kept going until she reached the motel she had stayed in on the way out. This time she left her laptop in the car and was back on the road with the first light.</p>
