<p class="pagecaption">Chapter 2</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her hand hovered over the book, wanting to pick it up, but annoyed by it as well. She gave a sharp laugh and opened it to reveal a neat, looping hand, in dark purple ink, filling the first pages.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Greetings traveler.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You are likely wondering where you are and how you got here. You have been carefully selected because you have shown intelligence, curiosity, and ability in your daily life. You have been brought here by means both magical and technological to take part in maintaining the Balance in the Multi-Verse. I am sorry, however, the only way to return to your point of origin is by your own discovery of its location.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I wish I had time to give you all the information you will need for this task, however, the knowledge would fill a library and take life times to impart. Such a library is one of the many rooms available to you inside this magical construct which will be your home. This construct is large, comprising over 70 rooms, although some are merely connecting items. But I digress. To save you a bit of confusion, there are only four truly important areas. These are the Library, the Throne Room, the Core Systems, and the Interface.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You may reach the Library by descending the stairway to your courtyard and taking the first door on your right. When you enter the library, ask Kyira, the librarian, for the suggested first volumes. There are five of them, titled as follows: Magical Theory; Gate Theory; Gods, Goddesses, and the rest; Hut Concepts; and A Quick History of the World. They are not nearly enough to tell you all that is happening, but they will give you a fighting chance at knowing what to ask. The realms are vast and we are but one among the multitudes. It is not possible to be all places at all times. The slice of the realms you experience will be different than the ones I have seen. Take heart that your contributions will always effect those around you and may change the very fabric of the realms you touch.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Kyira has agreed to stay in the Hut to assist you in finding other volumes that might be of assistance. I would take it as a great kindness if you treat her with respect. If you do not, she is under no obligation to remain and you will need to find items in the library for yourself, rather than being able to ask her for them.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Throne Room is the main control center for this construct. From here you can move the Hut through space and time to the areas needing your attention. The recommended reading list will give you some idea about what this means. This room is accessed by descending your stairwell to the first landing, entering the sitting room, and taking the door to your left.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Core Systems are accessed through a hidden door behind the rear head to the right of your throne. This is the heart of the Hut, providing the ability to move through time and space and the power required to keep the Hut alive.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Interface is the exit to the Real-Space Realms and is the only way in or out of the Hut. The door at the end of the Throne Room leads to the interface room.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You should have found a key with this notebook. This Master Key will grant you access to everything within this construct. The key has many features to help you figure out its various functions and uses.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Once again, I apologize for not being able to provide you with more assistance in this initial transition, however, events are unfolding far more quickly than I expected and I must rush to meet them. The last advice I can give is watch everything and pay attention to anything you hear. Sometimes the smallest statement carries the biggest impact. Good luck and be careful.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Irena</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stared at the book, then flung it down on the bed. "Like that's supposed to help?" she yelled. "Thanks so very much!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know where the library is and that you have a librarian to talk to as well. It wasn't totally useless," Tyana's voice answered from the air around her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But it didn't tell me who Irena is or what I'm wanted for. What does she want? And how can she expect me to help her after she has kidnapped me? What if I say no?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is your choice, of course. Truly, Irena wishes she could have written more, but there really was no time. She felt that spoon feeding you information would not be fair, it wouldn't prepare you for times when you would know more about a situation than she would and then you would have to act for yourself. Still, I shouldn't tell you more, but I am here and she is not. There is a war on, not the usual kind with two groups of beings lined up to fight each other. This war is a battle between the hard polarities of the multi-verse, between law and chaos, order and anarchy, freedom and oppression, between all the opposites that balance to produce the multi-verse. Forget what you may have been taught by a religion or even a secular teacher, if any polarity wins this war, the multi-verse will collapse. Only with the balancing of all these oppositions can life exist, let alone thrive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And this means what for me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We need your help in restoring the balance between these polarities. It means going out into the various worlds of the multi-verse and opposing any strong polarity. You should pull down systems of order where they are destroying free action, add stability to chaos, add order where anarchy prevails. In short, try to shift any out of balance system toward a more neutral, centered position. It won't be easy to determine and it will be harder to accomplish, but I do not exaggerate when I tell you the fate of many depends on you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh please, you expect me to believe any of this?" Sophia asked as she pushed herself up to sit on the bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What was the focus of the 'game' you were writing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, maintain..the....balance......save......Oh Fuck."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you find it so hard to believe when it becomes real?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was safer as a game. I put in my hours, collect my pay, and watch it go live. Then keep the actors pointing the players at the goals. I Hate being a Player Character. I really prefer to create the scenarios."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And life happens when we are making other plans." Tyana faded back into view. "Outside this construct, this Hut, lies a world that is not your own. Walk among its populace and observe. See what is happening and decide if you can help. At the very least, you need to know this Hut is damaged. You will have to find a way to repair it if you want to return to your home. Kyira and I will help you as much as we can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, library first then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would recommend it. Talk to Kyira, look over the reading list, then decide what your first step will be."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia slowly pushed herself off the bed, stood on still rubbery legs, and inched over to the nearest window. She stood, staring into the courtyard, until she felt like she could walk without falling. She took the stairs one at a time and slowly, noting the arched opening to the sitting room. The second landing ended at a short hallway leading to the courtyard. The scents of rich earth, flowers, and greenery greeted her. The late sunshine was warm on her face. 'No way,' she thought to herself, 'This can't be some constructed thing, it has to be real.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The courtyard was narrow and long, sandwiched between the walls of the rooms around it. Two four foot wide by fifteen feet long flower beds stretched down the center of it and a small fountain splashed into a pool between them. At the end opposite her a bench sat, sheltered under an overhanging balcony, and facing the flowers. Two doors led out of the long wall to her right, a single passage continued behind the bench, and another door opened in the ivy covered long wall to the left of the bench.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The heavy wooden door, in the first doorway, opened with the squeal of long unused hinges. Beyond the door was a narrow wooden stairway over a yawning black void. It rose to meet a small stone chamber, seeming to float in the vast darkness. Other wooden stairwells rose and descended from the stone chamber to other floating stone chambers, as far as she could see in the light from the door behind her and spilling from the various floating rooms. Terror constricted her chest, driving her back into the sunlight. She collapsed onto the paving by the nearest garden bed and sat, head in her hands, shaking and breathing with great difficulty.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Within seconds the attack passed, leaving Sophia surprised but pleased. Rather than return to the door right away, she walked along the paved sections of the courtyard, listening to the fountain and soaking in the warm light.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly she returned to the open door. Focusing her attention on the lighted doorway at the top of the stairs she hurried up the narrow flight. Vertigo pulled at the edges of her mind as she stumbled into the small chamber. A flickering oil lamp sat in the center of a rough wooden table, casting dancing shadows around the six sided room. A small wrought iron stool was pulled up to the table and a closed book, bound in a light tan leather, rested next to the lamp. Hanging from the center of the ceiling was a large bronze bell, dark with age and soot. A  small mallet hung next to it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She reached for a book in one of the niches and her hand passed right through it. The same thing happened with every shelf and book except for one. A small green volume came back from the last shelf she tried. Flipping it open she read a short, hand written passage.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Akhalt</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Devil cursed and demon haunted Akhalt, center of the Galhai Wastes, where power mad sorcerers of yore called down to this earthly sphere a demon from beyond, to their unending sorrow... Akhalt, where the Undying One rules from the Glowing Throne to this very day... doomed, cursed Akhalt, which the very gods spurned, transforming all the realm around it into a burning waste...</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Akhalt, where Tesch Mar and Nyigroth battled for the Star Stones, greatest of the Ancient Magics. Desolation is all that remains and the Star Stones are scattered to the winds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She set the book back on a different shelf than it had come from and turned to the book already on the table. She had just flipped it open when a woman stalked in from one of the entries. "The least you could do is put it back on the right shelf," she said. Sophia jerked her head up in surprise and stared at the person in front of her. She was tall, almost six feet, with curly blood red hair on top of the most beautiful face Sophia had ever seen. Two strips of cloth dropped from her shoulders, barely covering her breasts, and fanned out to circle her waist. A small section continued down to mask her crotch while revealing most of her thighs. What caught and held her attention though, were the large, black, bat-like wings folded neatly against her back and the long, twitching tail just brushing the floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...I'm sorry..." Sophia stammered, jumping up from the table and backing to the offending shelf. She grabbed the book and held it out to the woman with shaking hands. "Where...where does it go?" she asked timidly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The woman gently took the book, turned, giving Sophia a clear view of just how little the cloth covered, and placed the book on the original shelf. "Right here. If you are ever in doubt, place the books on one of these shelves. They will reshelve themselves from there." She pointed to a small niche next to each of the doors. "I am Kyira, the librarian. And you are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sophia...Nelson."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome to the Hut and to the library. If you need anything, ring the bell and I will come and assist you." Kyira turned to go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you...could you find a few volumes for me? A note from Irena said I should ask you for....for...oh, what were they again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok, I think I know the ones you mean." Kyira slowly reached up toward the ceiling. Sophia stared, mesmerized, at the way the cloth moved up Kyira's body. When Kyira lowered her hands they held five books. "Liking what you are seeing?" she asked, with a wicked smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia turned bright red, stared down at the table, and mumbled, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That wasn't the question. Not just into boys, are you?" Sophia mumbled something. "What was that? I didn't quite hear you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I find both boys and girls attractive," Sophia said to the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, I'm so ugly you can't look at me?" Kyira teased.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, that's not why. I shouldn't stare, it's not polite."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe not where you come from. However, I find it a compliment, so stop cowering." She set the books down in front of Sophia. "These should get you started."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can you tell me about Irena?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who she is, what she wants, why I'm here, what I'm supposed to do, where I am?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. That's for you to discover, sorry. Oh, and the Short History book, that only applies to one of the worlds, possibly the one the Hut originated from. Irena never said. And the diary on the table is from the previous owner, the one who gifted it to Irena. It's an interesting read, although it won't tell you much about your situation. Need anything else? Otherwise I have things I can be doing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I'm ok." Sophia answered. Her stomach cramped and rumbled as she reached for the first book. "Before you go, do you know where I could find food? I haven't eaten in quite a while."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was afraid that noise meant the Hut was falling apart around us. Go back to your courtyard and turn to the right from the library door, toward the overhang and bench. When you reach that area, take the passageway to your left. That takes you to the Main Stairs. Go down to the floor and take the door just to the left of the single staircase. This takes you to the dining alcove. The other door in the alcove takes you to the kitchen. Any other questions before I go?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why can't I touch many of the books in these shelves?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not certain. You can always ask me to find anything you need if you don't find it on your own. Do you need something in addition to these volumes? Or, if you want me to reach again, all you have to do is ask. The bell will let me know if you need something when I'm not right here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not right now, just curious, that's all," Sophia replied, eyes back on the table. She rose, still not really looking toward Kyira, and started for the door to her courtyard. "I've got to eat. I'll read through these later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, they'll be here for you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia managed to get across the stairs over the open place by once again focusing on the far doorways. She breathed a large sigh of relief when she passed through the door back into her courtyard. The Main Stairs were light and airy, windows at every landing let in bright sunlight and warm breezes.   Byond the door was a small room with large bay windows overlooking a formal garden</p>

<p class="regtxt5"> The dining alcove held a small table, with place settings for two, set in a large bay window overlooking a beautiful formal garden. A purple cloth bound book sat on the table with a quill pen and bottle of red ink resting next to it. She looked at it for a few moments, then entered the kitchen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The kitchen was enormous with a large wood burning stove crouched in front of one wall, throwing heat out in great waves. Large wooden block tables held large knives, earthen bowls, and other kitchen tools. Along the far wall a marble counter contained three deep basin sinks and drain grooves for the dish racks on one end. Various cabinets and counters filled the rest of the space. She wandered around the space, opening cabinets, peering in drawers and into the ovens. A large cooler provided a wedge of cheese, the sink a tall mug of water, and one of the ovens a fresh loaf of bread.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Food and drink in hand she returned to the dining alcove and settled in. For a while she ate and looked out at the garden. When the food was gone, she slowly picked up the <a href="../../hut_online/musings.htm">book</a> and flipped it open. There were sections written in seven different hands on the first few pages.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly she set the book back down on the table. "Tyana?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes mistress?" Tyana's voice answered from the air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where is the rest of the crew?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The rest of the crew? You are the crew, mistress. Kyira and I are here to assist you. There are no others."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then what's this?" Irena asked, waving the book in the air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"An echo...um, nothing mistress, just a book."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"An echo? Tyana, what is going on?" Sophia paused for a long moment, thinking of other similarities between her project and this place. "Unless... Are you doing what we did, creating instances of this construct, based off a master version, and giving them to random people? It was the only way we could figure out for working a magical device into our game." Tyans faded into view and just smiled. "You aren't supposed to answer questions like that, are you?" Tyana just continued to smile. "We created a way to meet the master version and crew, did Irena do that as well?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tyana waited for a few moments once Sophia stopped speaking, before asking, "Was there anything else, mistress?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you alowed to tell me the best way from here to the throne room?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, mistress. Return to the kitchen, walk to the door on the far well and furthest to your left, cross through the formal dining room, exit through the single door on the far side of the room, and you will be in the throne room. Since you will ask anyway, the door to your left, as you enter the throne room, will take you to the interface room and the exit to the current realm."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The directions were simple, but they didn't prepare her for what she saw when she pulled open the door. The far wall was seventy feet away. To her left the massive hall extended another fifty feet, to the right it extended almost two hundred feet to a raised dais, supporting a large throne, crafted from enormous bones, and illuminated by a single shaft of light from above. Raising her eyes she saw a spiral galaxy swirling high overhead, where the ceiling should have been. The walls were black obsidian with veins of golden light shimmering from them. Tall, graceful columns of the same material reached to where the ceiling should have been. The floor was pink granite with etched black runes swirling and eddying about.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her footsteps echoed in the cavernous hall as she started walking, then running, toward the throne. Caution tried to pull her to a stop, but the need to be in the throne won out. Warmth and comfort enfolded her as she settled onto the cushion resting in the hollow of bone forming the seat. Images crashed into her head, faster and faster, twisting and roiling like an angry sea. For long moments she tried to cling to them, make sense of the currents. As they overwhelmed her she fought against them, pushing and twisting, trying to claw free of the pounding intensity of them. Blackness closed in around the edges of her vision and Tyana's voice whispered softly, "Let go. Let it happen. Become one with us and find peace." She fought to relax, to give in to the sucking blackness, but her mind fought to hang on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One scene flashed by, clear and complete. The view was from the throne, looking down on a blonde haired, boyish looking man. His face was pouty and spoiled looking, wearing a pleasant but almost gloating smile. He was dressed in rich, gaudy black clothes trimmed with orange. Four men in black armor with orange trim flanked him. "Mistress of the Hut, I would ask you to grant me the knowledge of the shifting magic you use to move this hut. In return I shall grant you several Ancient Magic items I have in my possession."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A name flashed into her mind, Aztol, followed by various incidents of horrific deeds perpetrated by him. After a pause she spoke, "Upstart, what makes you think I would wish your tech? You seek knowledge beyond your wisdom, power beyond your ability. I shall not grant you anything. Take your rag-tag bunch of misfits and leave. Seek not to bother me again, for that day shall be your last."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His composed face twisted into a mask of rage. "You think you are so powerful. I will crush you like the insignificant fool you are. Soon the very demons of hell will tremble before me. You will beg me for mercy but it will be too late." His wild violet eyes stared into Sophia's calm ones as he spit and twitched with rage. "Doom shall fall upon you and I shall be its instrument." He turned and stalked from the room as the image faded and Sophia slid into unconsciousness.</p>
