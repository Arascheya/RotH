<p class="pagecaption">Ashta - Chapter 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bad dreams, chained to a wall, heaving, bucking floors, the smell of salt and then horrible crashes, fire, and a sharp pain in my head. I pried my eyes open on sand. Hot sun burned down on my back and water tickled my feet. Before I could get up someone was speaking to me. I didn't catch all of what he said but there was something about a slaver and a city. He didn't stop to talk, didn't answer any questions I croaked after him, just shoved two spikes at my hands and retreated to a fire up the beach.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The air was hot and thick, pressing down on me. Each breath felt like water with a little air. I struggled to my feet and looked at my surroundings. I was on a beach with a jungle starting just above the high water line. Ship wreckage was piled up on an outcropping of stone just off shore. Flies buzzed around the dead body washed up near me. The smell of death, overpowering perfume, damp, and decay clogged my nose. Pain throbbed at my temples and my tongue rasped across cracked and swollen lips. Thirsty, I was so thirsty. I staggered over to the man and his fire and asked for water. He shook his head and pointed farther along the beach, "There's water over there. Watch out for the crocodiles," he replied in broken Stygian.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll fill your skin if you could let me have a bit of yours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He just stared at me, opened his skin, and held it upside down. "Sure, you can fill mine. I was going to get to it later," he replied as he tossed the empty skin my way. I would have grumbled at him but it would have taken too much energy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slogged up the beach, slowing when I saw the crocodiles ahead. I slipped toward the jungle and tried to pass through the tangle of vines and bushes, but couldn't. Edging along the foliage, I tried to slip past, hoping the crabs and bodies along the beach would keep them distracted. It worked for about ten yards, then one of them spotted me and came running. Its jaws opened and it lunged. I stumbled back enough that it caught and tore my leg, but it didn't get a grip. It lunged again and I finally remembered the spikes in my hands. I slashed and hacked at it, not in a clumsy and random way, but as if I had weilded weapons before. A dim glimmer of something rose in my memory, but it quickly retreated as I focused on the teeth slashing at me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The battle was over in seconds. The crocodile was dead and I was slumped in the sand next to it. I started to stand again when a second one charged. Cold anger seared along my nerves and I pitched myself forward at it, stabbing and hacking at the sandy, wrinkled hide. This one died as I plunged a spike deep into its eye. Two more came and two more died. By the end I was bloody, torn and exhausted, but I was alive and they were dead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sand stuck to the blood caked on me and sifted into my wounds as I crawled to the small stream. I drank my fill and filled the water skin before rolling into the water and cleaning the blood and sand off myself and the skimpy slave wear I wore. The water revived me slowly. Once I could stand again I took the full skin and the smallest crocodile and dragged them back to the man's fire. After a hard look, he held out a knife and let me cut meat from the corpse and cook it. He refused any for himself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'd better get going. That slaver certainly won't be waiting for you," the man said once I'd finished wolfing down my food.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What slaver? Where am I?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The one I told you about. Did you hear nothing? You are on Tortage, Jewel of the Barachan Isles, and a pirate haven. To the west is Atlantis, silent and dead under the open ocean. Eastward lies Hyborea, where the world's doom rises, and just up the trail is the slaver, Saddur, who will end your freedom if he reaches Tortage city before you. Remember, go see Nadini, the Seer, and tell her Kalanthes of Ibis sent you. And you might help that poor girl chained up in the path. Never know when you might need a friend. Now go, and quickly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why haven't you helped her?" Anything to distract me from the way my skin crawled at the mention of the slaver's name.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It isn't my affair and I dare not be seen here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I have seen you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know anyone that would do you favors? I rather think not and were you to talk, I could reveal your ex-slave status. The woman is from Tortage, might have friends, and I don't have anything I can use against her. I will not take that risk. Now go, before it's too late."</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">I finished the last cooked bits of crocodile, hoisted myself to my feet, and returned to the only path I had seen into the forest. Cries for help reached me as I rounded the first bend. From the forest to the right came a shout of, "Shut up whore, we'll see to you soon enough." A woman hung from chains thrown over a suspended pole. Her arms were spread and pulled tight enough she could only sag slightly from heat and exhaustion. Her face was pleasant but rather plain, showing fear and wear. The few clothes she wore were tattered and stained. Just enough was left to my imagination to rouse my interest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A friendly face amongst so much ugliness," she said as I cautionously stepped closer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"By the gods..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Free me, I beg you! Those brutes set upon me in a pack less than an hour ago, and ran me down as I fled. Animals!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who did this to you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was a captive of the Tyrant of Tortage, though I managed to flee after three days in the less than tender care of his Red Hand soldiers. I had hoped to hide outside the city until they forgot about me, but the Scavanger chased me down. I've been hanging here while they decide what to do with me when they are done."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think I can cut these chains."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Scanvenger captain has the key. He was headed to the beach to pick the bones of the latest wreck. Please, kill him and free me!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who am I freeing? Is there more to this than you are telling me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am Casilda, a..an entertainer. I was captured, used cruelly, and managed to escape when the soldiers got too drunk to keep careful watch. That's all there is. Please help me before the scavengers come back for me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I found the scavangers right where Cassilda said they would be. They fought with ferocity, but little skill. After the crocodiles, they seemed very easy, as if my body remembered how to fight men. I would have taken some of their gear, but it was worse than the slave garment and spikes I had. All I took was the key to the chains the leader had around his neck on a copper chain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The heat was oppressive. By the time I had finished the battle, sweat was rolling off my skin. At least there was the water for a quick swim to get the blood off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have been ill-used, Cassilda. I'll protect you now," I said as I turned the key in the locks holdding her in place. She collapsed into my arms, almost sliding to the ground before she found her balance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And I will thank the gods each dawn that you found me here. Come then - to the city. Maybe once we're safe, I'll reward you for your efforts," she replied as she kissed my cheek. Her hand lingered on my back a few seconds, then she moved behind me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You there, she's ours," A burly man shouted as he ran at me. Others boiled out of two small camps hidden in the trees and charged at us. The fight was short, brutal, and exhausting. I was bleeding from numerous cuts and my ears were ringing from the blow to the side of my head. Cassilda had stayed out of the way and collected fewer cuts than I had, however, we were both covered in blood.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* fights thru the scavangers just up from the chains, then they wash up and head deeper into the jungle */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you want to wash up before we go? Get some of the filth from those things off you?" She nodded and followed as I led the way back to the beach. </p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just ahead several scavangers were patrolling outside a small camp.</p>
