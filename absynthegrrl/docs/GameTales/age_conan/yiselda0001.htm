<p class="pagecaption">Yiselda - Chapter 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bad dreams, chained to a wall, heaving, bucking floors, the smell of salt and then horrible crashes, fire, and a sharp pain in my head. I pried my eyes open on sand. Hot sun burned down on my back and water tickled my feet. Before I could get up someone was speaking to me. I didn't catch all of what he said except I had to kill a slaver before he reached the city and to talk to someone named Nadini inside the city. He didn't stop to talk, didn't answer any questions I croaked after him, just shoved two spikes at my hands and retreated to a fire up the beach.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I struggled to my feet and looked at my surroundings. I was on a beach with a jungle starting just above the high water line. Ship wreckage was piled up on an outcropping of stone just off shore. Flies buzzed around the dead body washed up near me. The smell of death, overpowering perfume, damp, and decay clogged my nose. Pain throbbed at my temples and my tongue rasped across cracked and swollen lips. Thirsty, I was so thirsty. I staggered over to the man and his fire and asked for water. He shook his head and pointed farther along the beach, "There's water over there. Watch out for the crocodiles."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll fill your skin if you could let me have a bit of yours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He just stared at me, opened his skin, and held it upside down. "Sure, you can fill mine. I was going to get to it later," he replied as he tossed the empty skin my way. I would have grumbled at him but it would have taken too much energy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I walked up the beach, slowing when I saw the crocodiles ahead. I slipped toward the jungle and tried to pass through the tangle of vines and bushes, but couldn't. Edging along the foliage, I tried to slip past, hoping the crabs and bodies along the beach would keep them distracted. It worked for about ten yards, then one of them spotted me and came running. Its jaws opened and it lunged. I stumbled back enough that it caught and tore my leg, but it didn't get a grip. It lunged again and I finally remembered the spikes in my hands. Something clicked into place and I slashed and hacked at it. Not in a clumsy and random way, but as if I had weilded weapons before. A dim glimmer of something rose in my memory, but it quickly retreated as I focused on the teeth slashing at me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The battle was over in seconds. The crocodile was dead and I was slumped in the sand next to it. I started to stand again when a second one charged. Cold anger seared along my nerves and I pitched myself forward at it, stabbing and hacking at the sandy, wrinkled hide. This one died as I plunged a spike deep into its eye. Two more came and two more died. By the end I was bloody, torn and exhausted, but I was alive and they were dead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sand stuck to the blood caked on me and sifted into my wounds as I crawled to the small stream. I drank my fill and filled the water skin before rolling into the water and cleaning the blood and sand off myself as well as I could. The water revived me slowly. Once I could stand again I took the full skin and the smallest crocodile and dragged them back to the man's fire. After a hard look, he held out a knife and let me cut meat from the corpse and cook it. He refused any for himself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'd better get going. That slaver certainly won't be waiting for you," the man said once I'd finished wolfing down my food. "And you might help that poor girl chained up in the path. Never know when you might need a friend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why haven't you helped her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It isn't my affair and I dare not be seen here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I have seen you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know anyone that would do you favors? I rather think not. The woman is from Tortage and might. I dare not take that risk. Now go, before it's too late."</p>
