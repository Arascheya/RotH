<p class="regtxt5">/* mostly just ideas for future online chapters */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Gaming Company - when she is first helping out */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi was taking Irena to the weekly meeting. as they approached the conference room they could hear a heated discussion going on between two people. looking through the window next to the door they saw the owner and CTO arguing with someone on conference. "Do you wnat to sell this game at all? An adult rating will kill you. You won't be able to advertise or sell in most of the usual channels. And you don;t want standard leveling procedures in the game? Few players will want that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We don't care about sales. Purity of concept is the important part."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you have to actually sell this thing. You want players and revenue, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, but not at the cost of concept. Look, we are a multi-national with extremely deep pockets. We can afford to lose money on this for a very long time if we desire. The actual business model is not your concern."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But if it fails, you won't get players!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We'll get the players we want either way. Are you concerned about our interests, or are you worried about your reputation for working on it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Doing an adult game is very risky. We could lose other contracts because we did something over the line."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can offer an alternate. We are paying you quite well for the skills of your team. I do notice you license your game engine, for a very reasonable cost, to other developers. We could terminate your contract, hire our own developers, and design in-house. It would take longer, but with the money we save not paying you, we would come out about even. You, on the other hand, would lose a very lucrative contract. And I'd be trying to poach your developers and artists. I can easily double most of their salaries. This is not ideal, we chose you because your team works exceptionally well together, however, if you continue trying to tell me my business, I will be forced to consider alternatives. Now, it looks like some of your people are waiting in the wings for the status meeting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* alternatively - could decide to make it a Free-Play offering and sell in-game enhancements, enable in-game, themed, advertising, and rely on other strategies to monetize the game costs */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean, no experience levels? How do you handle advancement? And no increasing stats either? Players won't accept this model!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It will if we offer the game for free."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can't be serious!" They watched as Brad collapsed into a chair. "That's business suicide!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. We are a wealthy multi-national. We could give this game away and be out little. I've been speaking with some of the division heads and they all recommend a free offering with monetized incentives. You want more interesting items, more healing items, more clothing and armor choices? Fine, you can purchase them from our store. You won't be able to buy anything that would shift game balance, but you can customize to your heart's content. We've been thinking of using the item and room builder systems in this way as well. Anyone can craft basic rooms, items, buildings, etc., but the more exotic materials and options come in paid for add on packs."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Security will be a nightmare!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. You have to be logged in with a legitimate account and everything is running the standard tight encryption. We can run checks every time things load. It isn't perfect, but all we really care about is a pirated account messing up legitimate users. As you've already pointed out, our small number of accounts shield us from the many who just won't play our game."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* alternative 2  - Jaime has flown in and is in the conference room talking to Brad before the weekly planning meeting */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Look, every decision you are making is killing your game. The average gamer doesn't understand skill based progress, they want levels and harder monsters and loot, lots of loot. Adult content destroys most of your gorilla marketing. None of the major game related web sites will touch you and you cut out the twelve to eighteen crowd, which are the highest sales. Your anti-spawn camping protocols are too harsh. But your worst one is saying up front that every player won't have the same opportunities. How in the hell do you propose to allow players to change your world and not have the game disintegrate? How are you going to update any non-actor run characters, places, evnets at the speed necessary for the changes that could happen? What in the hell are you thinking with this one?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do we have to have the 'our business model is none of your concern' discussion again? I told you before, you have been hired to create this game because you are the best and we want that. If you can't or won't do the job, I am prepared to poach your talent and do it in-house. The choice is yours, however, this is the only choice that is yours. This is our design spec and you can either implement it or step out of your contract. I will grant you the point on the dynamic world. We need to solve this, however, we can create additional content and leave the first parts static for now. It will mean more content for the starting areas and we will have to pull Centrys, and the first major goal sections from alternate London, Tlieran 12, and Zeltrop. We can't release those as static places."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider - pre-game game on several of the Rani Corp entertainment related sites */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">see this <a href="uru_pregame.htm">thread</a> from early Uru for the concept</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Hut becomes instancible once it is bound to the Balance Keeper's essence, when it is awakened in Irena */</p>
