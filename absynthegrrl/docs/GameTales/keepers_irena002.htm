<p class="pagecaption">Chapter 2</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next day the police came in to talk just after the lunch time rush. "Excuse me, Ms. Valinskya, do you have a few moments?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, officers. What can I do for you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are looking into the disappearance of a Ms. Nelson and would like to ask you a few questions." He proceeded at Irena's nod. "You last saw Ms. Nelson five nights ago, here at Waverly's, is that correct?" She nodded again. "Did she seem distraught, agitated, or nervous in any way?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not at all. She had a couple of drinks, she talked about her day, then she left."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did she say about her day?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing that sounded out of the ordinary. To me, it sounded the same as always, too many deadlines and too much stress, but exciting as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was anyone taking undo interest in her? Anyone watching her that would have left right after her maybe?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. She sat at the bar, two stools over from where you are right now, if I remember right, and had three, no, two drinks, Kahlua and creams, as I recall. She talked to me a bit about her day, then left."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you always remember what people have to drink?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If they are regular patrons, yes. Sophia was a regular, always sat at the bar, but had just started to talk a bit more over the last few months. She seemed reasonably happy, but lonely. Even so, she didn't strike up conversations with the sharks that sometimes come here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you know of anyone who had keys to her place? Did she ever mention a boyfriend or other close relationship?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. She talked a bit about dating, trying to find a boyfriend, but it sounded like she wasn't having any luck. Might I ask why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just exploring all options. Right now it looks like she just ran away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Without telling any of her friends or co-workers?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We see this a lot. Young, professional person gets in over their head, either socially or financially, then runs rather than try to sort it out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was she in financial trouble? She always paid here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry, I can't discuss that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, right. Of course."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think that's all for now. If you think of anything out of the ordinary, please give me a call," the man said as he handed her a card. On it was 'Detective I. Kowalsky'. "Oh, one more thing, did you know where she lives?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Out on Kingfisher St., in an apartment. She had me call her a cab a couple of times. I'm sorry, I don't remember the apartment number."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok. Her work gave us that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Should I be worried? My roommate works where she does and said I might have been the last person to see her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I don't think so. Like I said, it looks like she just ran off. Shame to abandon your stuff, but many do that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Abandon her stuff?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Looks like most of her things are still in the apartment. Odd about the computers, though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How so, if I might ask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She had two of them for starters and they were both wiped clean, the drives blanked so far they wouldn't even boot."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that odd?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"For a runner, yes. Most would have just left them. Wouldn't necessarily have made the bed or straightened up the bathroom either. Now I've said more than I should. It's been good talking with you, Ms. Valinskya."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And with you, detective."</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">"The police came by today, just like you thought," Irena said when Shandi came in from work.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I expected they would. They were quite thorough with us. Were you ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think so. Although the detective mentioned her computers were cleaned. I didn't clean them, just copied stuff. Also, he said her bed was made. Someone else has been there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And now we can't really get in. It'll be flagged off as a crime scene until they are done with it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you think Sophia ran?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not at all. She was team lead, happy, and loving the chance to see this game go live. Something happened to her. Aren't you out of here soon for your trip?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tomorrow. I didn't mention that to the cops, but they didn't tell me to hang around either. Should I still go?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't see why not. Nothing we can do except wonder about Sophia. I have no idea when the police seals come off a place during an investigation."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think they'll find her. This seems too weird and I can't imagine there are many clues, unless they find something like prints."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I keep thinking about what we've gotten involved in. Who'd believe that could happen? And there is the crystal."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are you trying to suggest, Shan? You think that crystal might be real?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Remember what else it'd do? If you expose it to light, it will try to summon again. I think we should go outside tomorrow morning, before you leave, and see what it does. Where is it, anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In my underwear drawer, wrapped in an old silk top I have."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, you are wondering too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had the silk and it seemed like a good idea last night, so yeah, I'm nervous about it." Irena had remembered silk supposedly stopped magic when she had driven back from the game company the night before. It had taken her a couple of hours to dig it out from the box in the storage locker in the basement. It was a painful reminder of a bad relationship several years before.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I never saw you as a silk person."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was that from what's his name? The one just after you started at Waverly's?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, it was his idea, along with the cuffs and chains. I sort of miss the swing, it had potential, but he was such a clumsy lover."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And a total ass-hole! I'm very glad you dumped him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, I know. And I wish I'd listened when you told me. Not off to Uru tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nope. Too much brain burn at work, trying to get everything covered. Could I persuade you to mix me something interesting?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. Any desires or should I surprise you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Surprise me. All I ask is not too sweet tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena returned a few minutes later with two small glasses filled with dark blue-black liquid. "This is a new one I found on-line. It's called a 'Black Ice' and is vodka and blackberry schnapps. I'm thinking of adding it to the Waverly's list."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's good. I think you should," Shandi replied, sipping slowly. "Tonight I kind of wish you'd used the grain alcohol instead, though."</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">The next morning they carried the wrapped crystal out on the deck. Irena carefully loosened the silk, then drew it off the top. As soon as the sunlight hit the crystal it flashed a brilliant violet and the deep sound echoed around them. Shandi looked around nervously, expecting people to be staring, but no one seemed to have noticed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Okayyyyy. That was what I expected but didn't think would happen," Shandi said slowly. Irena just nodded, staring intently at the crystal. "Wrap it back up, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, sure. I could stay..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should go. You've been planning this trip for months. I don't think we'll hear anything from the police for weeks and the crystal will still be as strange when you get back. I've got to run. Things are really crazy trying to keep on schedule with Sophia gone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena slid the crystal back in her dresser then stared at her laptop. She had been going to leave it home, but the disks from Sophia's systems were too tempting.</p>
