<p class="pagecaption">Irena's Diary</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">24 Jan 07</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kreel's messages prompted me to hunt for MYST related items in Shan's stuff. At first, all I found were her game disks, she had a complete set from MYST to MYST V: End of Ages, something called Journeyman Project, and bunch of others. I remember seeing her playing Riven and it looked cool. Maybe the games would help?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Interesting, a folded sheet of paper inside the MYST case with random numbers and notes, maybe solutions to the game? And a rewritable optical disk under the game media. She's at work for a couple more hours, maybe I should see what this is.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her personal diary. Wonder why she didn't encrypt it? It's the first thing she showed me how to do once she started that web designer job. Unless she forgot about it. The last entry date was two years ago.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Another disk in the MYST III: Exile case, this one encrypted. Maybe a newer diary? Media looks newer too, different dye color.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oh gods, I can't ever let her know I read that. I knew she had some hard times, but crap, and I can't even let her know I understand. I remember her coming back that fall, see seemed diminished for so long after the summer, but she didn't talk about it and slowly she got better. If only she'd said something! I would have tried to help.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So that's why she disappeared over the winter break between 93 and 94. Sirrus and Achenar, two very messed up young men. From what Shan wrote about their father, I don't understand how they ended up so twisted. How could you reach a point where you had to imprison your own children? And how could they get so twisted as to try for their father?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shit, it's later than I thought. I hope everything looks undisturbed on Shan's shelf. Made a copy of the disk for reference and have it encrypted. Wonder what else she has hidden with those games?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sent a note to Kreel today. Hopefully I can find more MYST related data in the entries. Damn, I still feel bad for violating her turst.</p>
