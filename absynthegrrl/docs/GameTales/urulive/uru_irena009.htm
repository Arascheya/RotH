<p class="pagecaption">Chapter 9</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi came in while Irena was unpacking. "How was your trip?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Great. Too much driving, like they always is, but so many relatives expect me to stop in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wish I could have gone. I really love your dad."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is there any word?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. The police are still nosing around, although their enthusiasm seems reduced. We're starting to slip at work. We need to have a live beta running next week, that's what we promised Rani Corp."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rani Corp? Who're they?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jaime's backers. It's their money funding this venture and we promised live testing starting next week."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not a game developer, but I do know Jaime's characters pretty well. Reading through her notes last week brought them all back to mind. If there's any way I could help, I'd be happy to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, maybe. It's not just knowing the characters. You need to set them up, but that is done in an editing environment, so you wouldn't have to code them directly," Shandi said, more to herself than to Irena. "It might just work. Come in with me tomorrow and I'll run it by the director. You still have two weeks off, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I did take three weeks for a break, yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then come in and see. I think you can help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, sure, I can do that," Irena replied nervously.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good! I'm headed off to Uru for a bit. You want to come along?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll see if I can catch up later. I need to relax a bit more from the drive first." Irena poured herself a drink, grabbed a book, and sat down to read. Every few moments a wave of nerves would hit her about her offer. She gave up after twenty minutes and linked to Uru.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was a message waiting from Kreel:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Shandi's Notes</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Not sure what all to make of Shandi's notes. The story about that girl disappearing is weird. Do you know what happened?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Kiril's journal has been hard to get to since he's been around so much lately, but I had a quick glance the other night and it seems that there is some sort of Bahro war going on right now. Also, he mentioned some ages I hadn't heard of before. Most likely new linking books have been found. And there was something about portals, too.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Clearly we have lots we'll need to discover together!!</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Kreel</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She sent a quick reply:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">About Shandi's notes</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Sophia seems to have just disappeared. Nothing in her apartment indicated a struggle. I found a strange crystal when I was checking, but that was the only odd thing.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Although, when the police were called, by Shandi's company, the bed was made and her computers wiped. All her data was still on them when I was looking. So, someone must have re-visited the scene. Which is definitely creepy.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Looking forward to exploring! Hopefully some time this coming week we can scratch out a bit of time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She fed pellets to the lake, then climbed to the top of the central ridge in Er'cana, and sat down to think. Several hours later she fed the new pellets to the lake and returned home, no closer to any answers than she had been when she started.</p>
