messages from Kreel:

look up in live site mails for times
I don't know about Ghareesen, but Kreel took a nice fall through the floor in Teledhan...did Irena tell you? Kreel wondered if you could get the log from Irena and submit a bug report on that?

ALso, Kreel asks you to let Irena know how much he enjoyed exploring Teledhan with her last night. He felt badly that his departure seemed rather abrupt, but the linking book were acting up and then the surface called and he had to go. He hopes to find some time tonight to explore some more.

next message

It sure was fun to meet Irena last night in D'Ni. We had fun as I guided her through the New Mexico desert cleft. She siad they were lots of things you had failed to mention to her.

Anyhow, I hope to meet up with her again tonight if at all possible. Surface matters continue to restrict my ability to transport down to D'Ni, but hopefully I can have some time tonight. Irena and I would like to explore some of the ages together and see what we can discover! That Yeesha person sure was cryptic with her hologram message in the cleft!! And Zandi wasn't all the helpful either.

If I can trasnport down to D'Ni tonight, I'll check my Ki thingy to see if Irena is around, and tell her to do the same for me.

(01/21 22:14:48)  Kreel: Do you have a pillar thingy in your Relto?
(01/21 22:14:58)  Irena: ok - sounds all mystical and stuff...:)
(01/21 22:15:20)  Irena: yes, there's a single pillar, looks like the ones behind you, except for different symbols on it.
(01/21 22:15:52)  Kreel: Right...that's where you need to start.  Let's go to your Relto and I can help you a bit, if you'd like
(01/21 22:16:30)  Irena: Sure, i'd enjoy the company. but we were doing something with Shandi's neighborhood?
(01/21 22:17:11)  Kreel: Oopps, I forgot.  Yes...go inside my house there and we'll have to use my Hood book...
(01/21 22:17:50)  Kreel: okay...now you go over and pull out the blue hood book on the left and link back there...I'll meet you there
(01/21 22:17:50)  Irena: ok, so use your book to go to a neighborhood?
(01/21 22:17:59)  Irena: ok - on my way...
(01/21 22:18:12)  Kreel: all set
(01/21 22:19:49)  Kreel: Okay...now when we go back to your Hood...you will have a new hood book that will always bring you back here
(01/21 22:19:56)  Kreel: I mean your Relto
(01/21 22:20:07)  Irena: And now i'm a member of the hood, according to the list in this watch...er..KI...:)
(01/21 22:20:42)  Irena: ok - so i open the book and click on the symbol that says share, right?
(01/21 22:20:46)  Kreel: Right, it should say on the bottom right "Member of Shandi's Bevin"
(01/21 22:20:53)  Kreel: Right
(01/21 22:21:08)  Irena: yup - says Shandi's Bevin. opening book now...
(01/21 22:21:13)  Kreel: ok
(01/21 22:22:14)  Kreel: okay, behind you..
(01/21 22:22:40) Kreel says hey
(01/21 22:22:53)  Irena: ah, sorry, just a bit of "linking?" brain lag...:)
(01/21 22:23:09)  Kreel: Takes a little getting used to
(01/21 22:23:35)  Irena: so, uh, been wondering a bit - this is a nice place and all, but where do i sleep, back on the surface?
(01/21 22:23:40)  Kreel: By the way, do you have me listed on your Buddy list in your ki?
(01/21 22:24:16)  Irena: yup - have you listed. My sister said to type in a number, when i did, your name appeared...
(01/21 22:24:31)  Kreel: Unfortunately, there's no practical space here...no kitchen, no bed, no food...
(01/21 22:24:45)  Kreel: We have to return to the surface for all that stuff..
(01/21 22:24:48)  Irena: no food? now that's just rude!
(01/21 22:25:16)  Kreel: Yeah, no pizza deilvery either...guess Pizza Hut doesn't do link in delivery!
(01/21 22:25:18) Kreel starts to laugh
(01/21 22:25:19)  Irena: ah well, so much for a way to quit the day job then i guess...:)
(01/21 22:25:22) Irena laughs
(01/21 22:26:04)  Kreel: You have to link back to the surface to use the restroom, too.  I haven't see a single one anywhere so far.
(01/21 22:26:11)  Kreel: Not so much as an outhouse
(01/21 22:26:36)  Kreel: Don't tell anyone, but I peed off the edge of my Relto once...
(01/21 22:26:44)  Irena: oh, now that's even worse than the no food problem...sounds like a Star Trek set...:)
(01/21 22:26:59)  Irena: ok - i won't tell, not if you don't tell if i find a bush sometimes...
(01/21 22:27:25)  Kreel: Deal...:-)
(01/21 22:27:25)  Kreel: So, what would you like to do first?
(01/21 22:27:44)  Irena: you were saying something about a desert?
(01/21 22:27:54)  Kreel: Ah yes...lets go outside for that...
(01/21 22:28:04) Kreel beckons you
(01/21 22:28:16)  Kreel: see that?
(01/21 22:28:19) Kreel points
(01/21 22:28:31)  Irena: yup - the pillar thing, got it.
(01/21 22:28:47)  Kreel: Put your hand where it looks like you shoud and see if anything happens
(01/21 22:28:54)  Irena: with the stylized hand print on it...
(01/21 22:29:01)  Kreel: try...
(01/21 22:29:02)  Irena: ok...
(01/21 22:29:36)  Irena: wow, that's kind of cool, in a weird sort of way...
(01/21 22:29:46)  Kreel: Well...looks like you got a book
(01/21 22:29:52)  Irena: and there's another book inside...
(01/21 22:30:00)  Kreel: What does the picture show?
(01/21 22:30:04)  Irena: sometimes there aren't any book?
(01/21 22:30:37)  Irena: i see a desert with a cone like mountain in the center.
(01/21 22:30:50)  Irena: so that's the desert you were talking about?
(01/21 22:31:12)  Kreel: That's it.  That book will take you to the desert.  Unfortunately, for some reason, the book won't let me come with you..you have to go alone BUT...
(01/21 22:31:22)  Kreel: I can communicate with you from here...
(01/21 22:31:56)  Irena: ok...is there anything in particular i should be looking for?
(01/21 22:32:29)  Kreel: Well...yes...I'll guide you, but you need to figure some things out for yourself...
(01/21 22:32:59)  Irena: sure...i'll give it a try...:)
(01/21 22:33:30)  Kreel: Okay...when you get there, just choose my name from your "Buddy" list and we can communicate through our KI's.  I'll talk with you from here
(01/21 22:33:43)  Irena: talk to you soon...
(01/21 22:34:46) To Kreel: hello? can you hear me?
(01/21 22:34:59) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Loud and clear...I take it you're in the Desert now?
(01/21 22:35:42) To Kreel: yup, inside some fenced in piece of land. it's ok to be here, isn't it? when i was little i got run off somebody's private property...
(01/21 22:36:18) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Yes..you're safe...now look around and see if you see a gate like thing...look behind it and see if you see anything..
(01/21 22:37:19) To Kreel: well, i was trying to read a sign, but there was this cloth with a hand design pasted over part of it. when i tried to pull it away part of the hand symbol glowed.
(01/21 22:38:14) To Kreel: cloth didn't want to move either - and it looks like the hand symbol on the pillar...guess they are related?
(01/21 22:38:20) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Good...that is what should happen.  You'll find out more about that cloth (and others like it) shortly.  For now, head towards the hill and go either left or right.
(01/21 22:38:44) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Let me know when you spot something interesting
(01/21 22:39:04) To Kreel: ok - i'm heading toward a wind-mill looking thing...
(01/21 22:39:17) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: What else do you see?
(01/21 22:39:37) To Kreel: looks like somebody's trailer-home.
(01/21 22:40:04) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Oh, good.  I met some guy named Zandi there...seemed to know some stuff.  Check and see if he's still around
(01/21 22:40:20) To Kreel: well, that's cool - didn't know this KI thingy did music - i have this nice south western kind of music playing now...:)
(01/21 22:40:38) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: That's Zandi's radio I'll bet...
(01/21 22:41:23) To Kreel: looks like he's still here, reading a book. will he mind being interupted?
(01/21 22:41:39) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Give him a nudge and see if he'll answer you..
(01/21 22:41:46) To Kreel: and i'm not sure it's his radio, as i get closer it sounds like two different tunes...
(01/21 22:42:02) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Hmmm...that's interesting...
(01/21 22:43:30) To Kreel: ok, now that was rather cryptic - journeys, trees, clefts...this 'she' he refers to, is that the Yeesha person you mentioned?
(01/21 22:43:37) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Before you leave Zandi...remember I told you about little gifts for your Relto?  Well, if you look around near Zandi, you might find one...
(01/21 22:44:15) To Kreel: ok - i'll check out around his area. and i think i saw a depression in the ground as i came up...
(01/21 22:44:47) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Yes, what I found out was that the "she" Zandi referred to was Yeesha..
(01/21 22:45:28) To Kreel: hmm - there was this piece of paper in the fire pit - when i picked it up it made my green book flash. it has a strange symbol on it. is this one of the 'gift pages'?
(01/21 22:46:20) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Yes...you found it!!  Touch the page and it'll somehow end up in your  book AND still be in the fire pit at the same time...don't ask how that works, but it does!
(01/21 22:47:01) To Kreel: ah - i wondered about that - i touched it, the book flashed, but it also seemed to return to the fire pit.
(01/21 22:47:40) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Also, I should tell you to look carefully around everywhere...you might find some other things that might look familiar...
(01/21 22:47:46) To Kreel: now i'm standing looking down a ladder into what looks like a living area, by the windmill. seems like it could fit the idea of cleft. i'm going down in now...
(01/21 22:48:25) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: That's the right place...careful...those bridges are rickity...
(01/21 22:48:49) To Kreel: ok...
(01/21 22:49:46) To Kreel: woah, shit! that one was weaker than it looked...damn
(01/21 22:50:42) To Kreel: is there some kind of gravity nuetralizer in that book or something? i thought for sure i was going to break a leeg...
(01/21 22:51:06) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Hope you're okay...I need to return to the surface for few minutes...keep exploring...you'll figure it out.  Try to get the windmill running
(01/21 22:51:43) To Kreel: ok - i'll keep hunting around and seeing if Zandi can be any Less Cryptic...:)
(01/21 22:51:44) From Kreel (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):  
(01/21 22:59:06) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: okay...back again...what have you discovered?
(01/21 23:02:43) To Kreel: not sure why Zandi stays in his trailer when there's all those nice, cool rooms down in the cleft, although it looks like someone tossed them around a bit
(01/21 23:03:23) To Kreel: found another cloth, a note from somebody named Atrus to his daughter Yeesha, a room with a lot of elaborate things in it, and what looks like a brake for the windmill..
(01/21 23:03:23) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Zandi's a bit quirky if you ask me...
(01/21 23:03:43) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Okay...did you try and release thebrake?
(01/21 23:03:59) To Kreel: still no restroom like places though - so, maybe the trailer does have at least one plus...
(01/21 23:04:30) To Kreel: i did get the brake released, was just headed up to see why it doesn't look like it started turning though...
(01/21 23:04:34) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: There aren't any bushes out there either, as I recall...
(01/21 23:05:19) To Kreel: no, not really, only little tiny ones...
(01/21 23:05:22) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Yeah...see if there's a way to get that windmill going...it gets sticky at times, Zandi told me
(01/21 23:05:58) To Kreel: oh, hey, there's another cloth over on Zandi's trailer...
(01/21 23:06:44) To Kreel: every time i touch one, a bit more of the symbol glows. is this a 'collect the entire set' kind of thing?
(01/21 23:07:42) To Kreel: and windmill is now turning, after pushing on the big lever.
(01/21 23:07:45) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: In a manner of speaking...find the message from Yeesha and more of that will be made clear...better you hear it from her than me
(01/21 23:08:08) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Good...now return to the cleft and see if anything is different...
(01/21 23:10:33) To Kreel: doors work now, i can almost see an image of a page if i push a green button, and i can get a holo of some woman speaking a foriegn tongue. She doesn't say much though.
(01/21 23:10:53) To Kreel: oh, and it looks like symbols on the wall that almost match symbols on the holo thing...
(01/21 23:11:18) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Okay...fool around with the symbols on the hologram machine and see if anything happens'
(01/21 23:15:15) To Kreel: ok - now that was an interesting message...:)
(01/21 23:15:48) To Kreel: i don't understand the bench though. a holo walks around the room, but when she hits the bench, it moves like she's real...
(01/21 23:15:59) To Kreel: i looked all over that thing, but it just looks like a bench...
(01/21 23:16:30) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Yeah...I noticed that, too.  Not sure what that means...Holos shouldn't be able to move real objects...strange indeed
(01/21 23:16:47) To Kreel: the cloth bits make a small amount more sense now...
(01/21 23:17:27) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Yes, we need to "find the journeys" she said...7 in in each age...7 n the desert.  how many have you found?
(01/21 23:18:55) To Kreel: five, no six - i see one on the door i accidentally left closed...
(01/21 23:19:27) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Okay...one more to go...look around very carefully...
(01/21 23:21:07) To Kreel: hmm - i'm going to guess it's not in the cleft? i've been everywhere down here and all i find is the door, but it's not a cloth...
(01/21 23:21:37) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Did you find something dead in the desert?
(01/21 23:22:42) To Kreel: ok, now that's too weird - Shandi's been playing the game called Riven, and i swear there's wreckage here that looks like something i've seen in her game...
(01/21 23:23:17) To Kreel: ah, dead thing ahead...going to check it out...looks big, whatever it was...
(01/21 23:23:29) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Yes...I went to Riven recently myself and noticed that.  There's a definite connection between the desert and Riven, but what it is, I haven't figured out yet
(01/21 23:24:05) To Kreel: ok, back up a moment here - you went to Riven? i thought it was a game Shandi had...
(01/21 23:24:23) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: By the way, I met Atrus, Yeesha's father, in Riven...there's a family history here that I haven't learned yet.
(01/21 23:25:14) To Kreel: damn - this is one weard-ass dead thing...but there is a cloth...looks like lucky number seven!
(01/21 23:25:14) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: Well, they call it a "game", but I'm beginning to suspect there's more to it that that...:-)
(01/21 23:25:28) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: That's it!!!
(01/21 23:27:22) To Kreel: i could get to like this jump off high things and not break yourself when you land...
(01/21 23:28:44) To Kreel: this tree thing is very alice in wonderland...secret passages, glowing symbols on the wall, and look, another book page...
(01/21 23:30:17) From Kreel in Irena's Relto: That's it...you should be back here soon...once you touch that page
(01/21 23:30:22) To Kreel: hmm - cavern-city, book with symbol, spiral, and a strange creature...it is very interesting in a not quite in kansas anymore way...:)
(01/21 23:30:59) From Kreel: welcome back!
(01/21 23:31:04) To Kreel: thanx!
(01/21 23:31:15) From Kreel: Well, now you know as much as i do.
(01/21 23:31:19) To Kreel: i guess i'll have to thank Shan for this little book next time i see her...:)
(01/21 23:32:00) To Kreel: OOC - shouldn't i have 4 pillars?
(01/21 23:32:28) From Kreel: I wondered about that, too.  I think we need to link to the hood and come back and all will be there...
(01/21 23:32:39) From Kreel: or here, as the case may be
(01/21 23:32:39) To Kreel: OOC - must go topside for a few - back soon...
(01/21 23:33:02) To Kreel: OOC - ok, lets try that when i get back...
(01/21 23:33:05) From Kreel: Me, too...surface is calling.  I'll try to come back later...if not, I'll look for you again
(01/21 23:33:16) From Kreel: Darn
(01/21 23:33:54) Kreel wishes Irena good luck
(01/21 23:34:06) From Kreel: Hope to see you a bit later....
(01/21 23:36:43) To Kreel: i hope so too!
(01/21 23:36:44) From Kreel (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):  
(01/21 23:37:07) To Kreel: OOC - it's really fun to try the RP aspect...haven't done it much in a while...:)
(01/21 23:37:07) From Kreel (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):

(01/23 02:17:57) Chat.log started...
(01/23 02:17:57)  Kreel: Shorah, Irena
(01/23 02:18:11)  Irena: back to the old hat, i see :)
(01/23 02:18:40)  Kreel: More comfortable
(01/23 02:19:09)  Irena: The hardhat did look a little large and heavy...
(01/23 02:19:33)  Irena: so, master explorer, what shall we do with this evening?
(01/23 02:19:35) From Kreel: Also, people kept confusing me with one of the DRC workers
(01/23 02:19:53)  Irena: and it would be bad to be confused with this 'DRC'?
(01/23 02:20:33)  Kreel: Well, not bad...but I can't answer questions that the DRC knows.  I found out it stands for the "Dni Reseach Council
(01/23 02:20:50)  Kreel: Apparently they run everthing around here
(01/23 02:21:11)  Irena: oh...have you met any of them, this DRC?
(01/23 02:21:42)  Kreel: Yes...I chanced upon a meeting one of them was holding to answer some questions...but I couldn't hear real well and didn't find out much
(01/23 02:22:34)  Irena: bummer, might have been interesting. do you know what they are researching or what their plans might be?
(01/23 02:23:14)  Kreel: Well, as I understand it, they have to approve all the linking books for use, for one thing.  If a book lacks their stamp, we're not supposed to use it
(01/23 02:23:44)  Irena: ah, control types, sounds like some of the people i work with.
(01/23 02:23:46)  Kreel: They are also real safety conscience...they put all these barriers and cones up as caution
(01/23 02:24:08)  Kreel: I guess they're afrain someone will go somewhere they shouldn't and get hurt or something
(01/23 02:24:12)  Irena: the cones did seem to lack a certain...resonance...with the surroundings...
(01/23 02:24:40)  Kreel: Right...This whole hood and city and cavern are some vast research area
(01/23 02:25:02)  Kreel: Not much is known about the history of this place or who the D'Ni were or how they lived
(01/23 02:25:11)  Irena: so, i came here because Shandi sort of invited me, but, i guess i'm not exactly sure what we are supposed to do...
(01/23 02:25:40)  Irena: are we supposed to help this research, or??
(01/23 02:25:49)  Kreel: Well, Yeesha's message said were supposed to "find the journeys".  I presume that has something to do with the pillars in your Relto?
(01/23 02:26:13)  Kreel: Why don't we start there?
(01/23 02:26:29)  Irena: i suppose it might - those same hand print symbols are all over them. we could start there, i guess. :)
(01/23 02:26:52)  Kreel: fine with me...show me your book
(01/23 02:28:00)  Irena: pick a pillar, any pillar...lol
(01/23 02:28:04)  Kreel: yep...I have four just like them.  Oh and I see you got your little bridge thingy
(01/23 02:28:24)  Irena: there was that paper in the fire pit.
(01/23 02:28:50)  Kreel: Hmmm....looks just like mine.  There's something odd about the sameness of our Reltos
(01/23 02:28:52)  Irena: it's cool - great place for a sunbath or something, and no neighbors to peep in...
(01/23 02:29:05)  Kreel: No place to peep From...
(01/23 02:29:07) Kreel starts to laugh
(01/23 02:29:20)  Irena: sounds like they were molded from the same factory - like prefabs or something?
(01/23 02:29:54)  Kreel: Yeah...this "age" thing...and something called an "instance"...Its like they all exist in the same space
(01/23 02:30:05)  Kreel: but not at the same time...or vice versa
(01/23 02:30:09)  Kreel: I don't get it
(01/23 02:30:22)  Irena: instance, hmm, Shandi talks about that a lot - but she's a programmer, so it's usually about code...
(01/23 02:30:58)  Kreel: Did you get a liitle book on your other book shelf?
(01/23 02:31:05)  Irena: need to pop to the surface for just a minute - brb
(01/23 02:31:13)  Kreel: ok
(01/23 02:34:15)  Irena: ok, i'm back - that does it - next time i'm dashing around behind the little hut...
(01/23 02:34:24) Kreel starts to laugh
(01/23 02:34:51)  Kreel: You've got another book on the other shelf that seems to have something to do with these pillars
(01/23 02:35:17)  Kreel: look at the book and the symbols
(01/23 02:37:07)  Irena: ok - different little symbols, matching the ones on the pillars, and sayings...
(01/23 02:37:14)  Kreel: right...
(01/23 02:37:26)  Kreel: I'm guessing books to link somewhere are in those pillars
(01/23 02:37:42)  Irena: might as well start with the mushrooms - i've been kept in the dark and fed manure before...might as well see if that's the story there as well
(01/23 02:37:50)  Kreel: And those titles in the book are the names of the Ages
(01/23 02:37:55)  Kreel: Okay
(01/23 02:38:04)  Irena: the was Teledahn, i think...
(01/23 02:38:21)  Kreel: Right...Teledah...land of mushrooms!
(01/23 02:38:42) Kreel doesn't eat mushrooms
(01/23 02:39:18)  Kreel: Try touching the hand
(01/23 02:39:26)  Irena: okayyyy - i thought these things were supposed to open?
(01/23 02:40:04)  Irena: time delay?
(01/23 02:40:16)  Kreel: There...two opened...I touched this one
(01/23 02:40:39)  Kreel: Well...which one?
(01/23 02:40:45)  Kreel: I think we need to share it
(01/23 02:42:50)  Kreel: Hmmm....
(01/23 02:43:05)  Irena: so, you arrive, and then your outer clothes arrive - at least it looks like underwear comes in at first...
(01/23 02:43:19)  Kreel: he he...
(01/23 02:43:27)  Irena: the weird part is your hair looks white before your hat arrives...:)
(01/23 02:43:45) Irena sneezes
(01/23 02:43:49)  Kreel: Well...my hair is...grey
(01/23 02:43:52)  Kreel: ish
(01/23 02:44:14)  Irena: a very distinguished silver, i would say - but the first look is bone white...:)
(01/23 02:44:28)  Kreel: There's some kind of grate at your feet...does it open?
(01/23 02:45:00)  Kreel: Apparently not.
(01/23 02:45:10)  Irena: damn, seems to be locked. why do i get the feeling this is another puzlle? :)
(01/23 02:45:32)  Kreel: I'm guessing there's a release somewhere else.
(01/23 02:45:51)  Kreel: looks like water underneatt here
(01/23 02:46:07)  Irena: huh, yeah, you're right..
(01/23 02:46:15)  Irena: guess it's time to look around a bit more.
(01/23 02:46:17)  Kreel: Hey...look at this...water everywhere
(01/23 02:46:44)  Kreel: Remember...we need to "find the journeys"...whatever thatmeans
(01/23 02:46:49)  Irena: so there is. and these cool little lamps. phosphoescence, i guess.
(01/23 02:47:05)  Kreel: it is cool...
(01/23 02:47:19) Irena sneezes
(01/23 02:47:21)  Kreel: Mushroooms...or much like them
(01/23 02:47:33)  Kreel: Do you have an allergy?
(01/23 02:47:42)  Irena: not sure about these spores, though. i think they make me sneeze...
(01/23 02:47:56)  Kreel: Is that what those white snowy things are...spores?
(01/23 02:48:28)  Irena: might be alergies - although, mushrooms don't bother me on the surface.
(01/23 02:48:40)  Kreel: Look behind you on the wall
(01/23 02:48:48) Kreel points
(01/23 02:48:50)  Irena: i thought they might be spores, maybe they're something else.
(01/23 02:48:58) Kreel points
(01/23 02:49:03)  Irena: oh, cool..:) another cloth!
(01/23 02:49:28)  Kreel: Wierd...did you hear that sound?
(01/23 02:49:28) Irena sneezes
(01/23 02:49:35)  Kreel: Bless you my child
(01/23 02:49:42)  Kreel: Let me see if I can touch it
(01/23 02:49:50) Kreel wants some space!
(01/23 02:49:57)  Irena: whatever they are, they make me sneeze. i think i'm heading for that light over there, see if it's better outside.
(01/23 02:50:23)  Kreel: LEad on
(01/23 02:50:30)  Irena: yeah, i did hear that - almost like a linking, but not quite...
(01/23 02:50:57) Kreel looks around for a bit
(01/23 02:51:11)  Kreel: Looks like some sort of lift
(01/23 02:51:24)  Irena: looks like a lift of some kind, no power though
(01/23 02:51:24)  Kreel: locked?  No power?
(01/23 02:51:56)  Irena: i think no power - i pushed the button and nothing happened...could be locked too, i suppose...
(01/23 02:52:01)  Kreel: I'm guessing somehow the water needs to drain off to open that hatch
(01/23 02:52:17)  Kreel: Did you see an opening somewhere?
(01/23 02:52:35)  Kreel: Look beneath the hut
(01/23 02:52:45)  Kreel: Looks like a drain to me...and a ladder
(01/23 02:52:45)  Irena: i see a ladder going down into the large drain. must be a valve or a pump somewhere...
(01/23 02:53:03)  Kreel: Well...your guess is as good as mine!
(01/23 02:53:08) Irena sneezes
(01/23 02:53:45)  Kreel: wow...look at this place!!!!
(01/23 02:53:49)  Irena: look at that...wonder what it does?
(01/23 02:53:59)  Kreel: where?
(01/23 02:54:23) Irena points
(01/23 02:54:32)  Irena: this big thing ahead of me..
(01/23 02:54:41)  Kreel: Wow....big machine...look at the size of that gear underneath
(01/23 02:55:14)  Irena: Damn! nothing small here!
(01/23 02:55:29)  Kreel: Look at those floppy things going up and down
(01/23 02:55:55)  Kreel: There's a lever up here
(01/23 02:55:56)  Irena: very strange life here...
(01/23 02:56:10)  Irena: is it stuck?
(01/23 02:56:18)  Kreel: nothing...either stuck or needs powe
(01/23 02:56:21)  Kreel: power
(01/23 02:56:32)  Irena: let me try this one
(01/23 02:56:33)  Kreel: How about that one?
(01/23 02:56:52)  Irena: looks like it needs power - it moved, but nothing happened
(01/23 02:57:07)  Irena: how about that third one, to your right?
(01/23 02:57:11)  Kreel: Well yours moved at least...but I don't see anything happening.  It looks like those gears are below are connected to it somehow
(01/23 02:57:42)  Kreel: Same thing..moves forward.  Must turn on that long shaft somehow
(01/23 02:58:04)  Kreel: What's that?
(01/23 02:58:09)  Irena: this pedestal thingy has a flickering light. think it might be a battery or something?
(01/23 02:58:18)  Kreel: Try it
(01/23 02:58:45)  Irena: and a symbol, looks like the ones in the classroom in our hood. which one was this, second or third one in, maybe 2 or 3?
(01/23 02:58:58)  Kreel: Leet me see it
(01/23 02:59:02)  Irena: hmm, it's trying...
(01/23 02:59:33)  Kreel: Ah...In Riven I learned that that is the D'ni symbol for 3
(01/23 02:59:46) To Kreel: ok - let me push it again...
(01/23 02:59:46)  Kreel: What do you suppose that might mean?
(01/23 03:00:05)  Irena: i don't know, but the little levers moved up a bit when i pushed
(01/23 03:00:28)  Kreel: Hmmmm...maybe push 3 times?
(01/23 03:00:37)  Irena: think it'll blow up or anything if i push again?
(01/23 03:00:48)  Kreel: Well....
(01/23 03:00:55) Kreel cringes
(01/23 03:01:16)  Irena: ok...here goes, was nice knowing you if it all falls apart...
(01/23 03:01:37)  Kreel: wow....
(01/23 03:01:50) Kreel looks up
(01/23 03:01:56)  Kreel: Some sort of antenna?
(01/23 03:02:18)  Irena: looks like it - not quite radio, no center piece...
(01/23 03:02:55)  Irena: there's some kind of viewer over here...
(01/23 03:03:02)  Kreel: Do you notice anything unusual about the sun here?
(01/23 03:03:45)  Kreel: What did you see?
(01/23 03:04:08)  Irena: yeah, it seems to be orbiting us - wow, i am the center of the universe - how cool is that?
(01/23 03:04:30)  Irena: and the machinery made a funny noise when the sun crossed the viewr
(01/23 03:04:31)  Kreel: What makes you think YOU're the center...could be ME!!!  
(01/23 03:04:41) Kreel starts to laugh
(01/23 03:04:44)  Irena: true - it might be...:)
(01/23 03:04:47) Irena laughs
(01/23 03:05:05)  Kreel: Hmmm....do you think the sun is the source of power here?
(01/23 03:05:59)  Kreel: Well...that got things going!!
(01/23 03:06:05)  Kreel: What did you do?
(01/23 03:06:12)  Irena: well, centering the sun sure made this place awfully noisy...:)
(01/23 03:06:21)  Irena: and things are turning - must be the trick...
(01/23 03:06:26)  Kreel: let me try this one again
(01/23 03:06:37)  Irena: still jammed?
(01/23 03:06:41)  Kreel: Hmmm...seems to be
(01/23 03:06:59)  Irena: i'm going to try and follow it - maybe it's something we can fix...
(01/23 03:07:04)  Kreel: And I don't know enough about this machine to attempt repair
(01/23 03:07:15)  Kreel: good idea
(01/23 03:07:35) Irena sneezes
(01/23 03:07:47)  Kreel: did you see that flying thing...WOW
(01/23 03:08:03)  Kreel: THere it goes again
(01/23 03:08:21)  Irena: i missed it - where should i look?
(01/23 03:08:42)  Kreel: don't see it now.  Keep your eyes peeled
(01/23 03:08:46)  Kreel: there
(01/23 03:08:53)  Kreel: did you see it?
(01/23 03:09:26)  Irena: i think so - big wings, long tail? Very strange?
(01/23 03:09:52)  Kreel: Nothing I know of like it on the surface...or where I'm from, i should say
(01/23 03:10:16)  Irena: yeah - none of this looks like anything i've ever seen!!
(01/23 03:10:24)  Kreel: I see the DRC have been here...look a barrier
(01/23 03:10:26) Kreel points
(01/23 03:10:47)  Irena: and a broken walkway beyond..
(01/23 03:11:03)  Irena: no way to get to the stuck shafts either.
(01/23 03:11:04)  Kreel: So there has to be some connection between here and back in the cavern
(01/23 03:11:19)  Kreel: Not that I can see
(01/23 03:11:23)  Irena: meaning the DRC have been here before us?
(01/23 03:11:32)  Kreel: That's my guess.
(01/23 03:11:42)  Kreel: Hey
(01/23 03:12:26)  Kreel: Funny...
(01/23 03:12:27)  Irena: hmm - big-ass bucket - only room for one though....
(01/23 03:12:37)  Kreel: what do you suppose that's for?
(01/23 03:13:05)  Irena: goes up to the top of that place we came out of...
(01/23 03:13:08)  Kreel: I wonder if we can get those buckets moving?
(01/23 03:13:51)  Irena: maybe this lever - you want to pull or risk the bukett?
(01/23 03:14:06)  Kreel: I'll risk the bucket...being a gentleman and all
(01/23 03:14:17)  Irena: ok - here goes...
(01/23 03:14:52)  Kreel: Something is happening...I can feel myself moving
(01/23 03:15:15)  Kreel: OUCH!!!
(01/23 03:15:23)  Kreel: GOt dumped out in some sort of room 
(01/23 03:15:25)  Irena: what happened? you OK???
(01/23 03:15:45)  Kreel: Yes...I'm okay...but that hurt a little.  Hold on...
(01/23 03:15:47)  Irena: hmm - what do you see?
(01/23 03:15:58)  Irena: nothing broken, i hope!
(01/23 03:16:03)  Kreel: The top of that lift...there's lock on it of some sort.
(01/23 03:16:17)  Irena: the lift? wicked!!
(01/23 03:16:34)  Irena: if you can get it moving i'll head back towards it...
(01/23 03:16:41)  Kreel: Head back to the lift...I think I got it going down
(01/23 03:16:52)  Kreel: Yep...going down
(01/23 03:17:02)  Irena: wicked cool - on my way
(01/23 03:17:10)  Kreel: It worked!!!
(01/23 03:17:34) Irena sneezes
(01/23 03:17:52)  Kreel: welcome aboard
(01/23 03:17:57)  Irena: is it as dusty upstairs?
(01/23 03:18:03)  Kreel: yes
(01/23 03:18:13)  Kreel: Ok  green down, blue up
(01/23 03:18:16)  Irena: oh...next time, anitihistamines!!
(01/23 03:18:34)  Irena: wicked view!
(01/23 03:18:37) Kreel makes note to bring some for IRena next time
(01/23 03:18:55)  Irena: and a cloth! sweet...
(01/23 03:19:00)  Kreel: the bucket dumped me out right there
(01/23 03:19:03) Kreel points
(01/23 03:19:25)  Kreel: Oh...there's the cloth
(01/23 03:19:34)  Irena: whew - didn't want to get hit in the head by one of those buckets
(01/23 03:20:05)  Irena: anything in the viewer?
(01/23 03:20:08)  Kreel: Take a look in that telescope
(01/23 03:20:34)  Irena: we were just down there.
(01/23 03:20:35)  Kreel (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):  
(01/23 03:20:50)  Kreel: Yeah...check this one out
(01/23 03:21:27)  Kreel: Hey, Irena...theres controls of some sort over here
(01/23 03:21:31)  Irena: these D'Ni people don't do small or quiet - damn those are Huge gears downb there...
(01/23 03:21:33) Kreel beckons you
(01/23 03:21:48)  Kreel: See what you think
(01/23 03:22:11)  Kreel: Maybe we can stop those buckets?
(01/23 03:22:12)  Irena: control system - looks like buckets and shafts - maybe a bit more...
(01/23 03:22:32)  Kreel: Pull something
(01/23 03:22:45)  Irena: ok - that's lights...
(01/23 03:23:17)  Kreel: That did something
(01/23 03:23:20)  Irena: bucket stop...
(01/23 03:23:41)  Irena: is anything changing that you see? i've got a little dial going down...
(01/23 03:23:57)  Kreel: Buckets are stopped
(01/23 03:24:17)  Kreel: That's all I can tell...besides the lights.
(01/23 03:24:29)  Kreel: I wonder if the drain is controlled from here?
(01/23 03:24:38)  Irena: not sure what the switch under the red marker does. did you see anything when i fllipped it?
(01/23 03:24:46)  Kreel: Nope
(01/23 03:24:59)  Irena: hmm - guess i'll leave it for now.
(01/23 03:25:01)  Kreel: The main shaft is still turning
(01/23 03:25:21)  Kreel: It looks like the lift goes higher...another level?
(01/23 03:25:30)  Irena: lets go see!
(01/23 03:25:42)  Kreel: Ok...
(01/23 03:25:50)  Kreel: push blue
(01/23 03:26:33)  Irena: uh, you ok?
(01/23 03:26:34)  Kreel (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):  
(01/23 03:26:50) To Kreel: that looked like a nasty fall!!
(01/23 03:27:27) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: I don't know...I'm back in MY Relto
(01/23 03:27:35) To Kreel: ouch!
(01/23 03:27:37) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: It looked like I crashed right through the floor
(01/23 03:27:42) To Kreel: any way i can get you back here?
(01/23 03:27:56) To Kreel: or do we meet in the hood and come back that way?
(01/23 03:28:19) To Kreel: you fell right through the floor! i thought it was solid.
(01/23 03:28:24) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: I'd guess you'd have to send me an invite or meet me back in the hood
(01/23 03:28:52) To Kreel: send an invite - that's be through this KI thing, right? is that how you got me to the hood in the first place?
(01/23 03:30:09) To Kreel: well - good news anyway - the water went away...
(01/23 03:30:39) To Kreel: i went back down. ok, i'm going to take a look at this KI thingy and see if i can figure out invites.
(01/23 03:30:40) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: Can you re-invite me back to where you are..I think I can use the nexus to get back
(01/23 03:31:38) To Kreel: well, that was the first thing about this weird device that was almost intuitive. i think i sent you an invite...:)
(01/23 03:31:48) From Kreel in Kreel's Nexus: Got it
(01/23 03:33:36) Error: Don't know how to '/beckon'
(01/23 03:33:45) Irena sneezes
(01/23 03:33:47)  Kreel: I'm back
(01/23 03:33:50)  Kreel: where are you?
(01/23 03:33:54) To Kreel: so i see!
(01/23 03:34:04)  Irena: going up?
(01/23 03:34:04)  Kreel: Wow...that was wierd
(01/23 03:34:05) Irena laughs
(01/23 03:34:18)  Kreel: Let's try that again, without the fall this time
(01/23 03:34:26)  Irena: yes, that was - did it hurt? are you ok after the fall?
(01/23 03:34:35)  Kreel: I didn't feel a thing
(01/23 03:34:49)  Irena: that's good - it looked like it could have been very painful!
(01/23 03:35:02)  Kreel: I instinctevly went for my Relto book
(01/23 03:35:10)  Irena: i walked across on the right and was fine...
(01/23 03:35:16)  Kreel: There
(01/23 03:35:25)  Kreel: Another cloth
(01/23 03:35:28)  Irena: looks like right side is safe!
(01/23 03:35:40)  Irena: cool!
(01/23 03:35:49)  Kreel: Yes...but I think I ought tell someone in the DRC about that
(01/23 03:35:55)  Irena: alright, how did this person rate a bed?
(01/23 03:36:27)  Kreel: Hmmm...can't seem to get on the bed
(01/23 03:36:46)  Irena: wow - you're standing above the bed :)
(01/23 03:36:49)  Kreel: hey...
(01/23 03:37:05)  Irena: bed jumoping!
(01/23 03:37:07) Irena cheers
(01/23 03:37:09)  Kreel: don't tell anyone I did that!
(01/23 03:37:15) Kreel starts to laugh
(01/23 03:37:37)  Irena: is that a book page, over by all that packing?
(01/23 03:37:40) Irena points
(01/23 03:37:57)  Kreel: by golly...I think it is
(01/23 03:38:11)  Kreel: some sort of Teepee looking thing
(01/23 03:38:17)  Kreel: take a look
(01/23 03:38:38)  Kreel: Can you reach it from there?
(01/23 03:38:47)  Irena: yup - it flashed my book, just like the other ones.
(01/23 03:38:52)  Kreel: Wow...look at all the papers on this desk
(01/23 03:39:19)  Irena: yeah - are those strange beasties on this end?
(01/23 03:39:32)  Kreel: Some other ones
(01/23 03:39:53)  Kreel: Must be some sort of study notes on life here
(01/23 03:40:02)  Kreel: Can't make out the words though
(01/23 03:40:20)  Irena: i see there are some of those little floater guys in the aquarium over by the book page. wonder what that was all about?
(01/23 03:40:26)  Kreel: Theres' some sort of map, too
(01/23 03:40:32)  Irena: what's the map looking one in the center?
(01/23 03:40:44)  Kreel: Well, there's instructions here for that...looks like it is some sort of safe
(01/23 03:40:51)  Kreel: Is there a button on it somewhere?
(01/23 03:40:53)  Irena: really?
(01/23 03:41:10)  Irena: yeah - there's a light switch on top.
(01/23 03:41:26)  Kreel: Okay it says to push and hold for...hold on
(01/23 03:41:36)  Kreel: More than 3 seconds
(01/23 03:41:53)  Kreel: hold it down
(01/23 03:41:57) From Kreel in Irena's Teledahn: there
(01/23 03:42:01)  Kreel: There
(01/23 03:42:18)  Kreel: You had it...
(01/23 03:42:35)  Irena: yup - i think i twitched, it closed again. hang on a minute...
(01/23 03:43:04)  Irena: hmm, you want to try?
(01/23 03:43:35)  Kreel: won't let me
(01/23 03:43:53)  Irena: won't let me either...
(01/23 03:43:58)  Irena: OOC - bug?
(01/23 03:44:17)  Kreel: Sure seems like it...
(01/23 03:44:24)  Kreel: It opened then closed again
(01/23 03:44:29)  Irena: OOC - hang on, dumping logs
(01/23 03:44:38) Logs dumped to "aquarium"
(01/23 03:44:57)  Kreel: me too
(01/23 03:45:05)  Irena: wonder if we link back to my relto and come back in if it will reset the security mechanisms?
(01/23 03:45:10)  Kreel: we'll both report that one
(01/23 03:45:14)  Kreel: Worth a try
(01/23 03:45:17)  Irena: OOC - yup!

(01/24 02:39:34) Chat.log started...
(01/24 02:40:08) To Kreel: um, something is very wrong - all i see is a title, but no message body.
(01/24 02:40:29) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: Hmmm...what does the title say?
(01/24 02:40:43) To Kreel: ps to earlier message
(01/24 02:41:09) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: okay..just resent..see if you can read it now
(01/24 02:41:33) To Kreel: no..:(
(01/24 02:41:45) To Kreel: i tried to send you one as well, but all i could type was the title...
(01/24 02:42:00) Logs dumped to "KIWeird"
(01/24 02:42:10) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: Hmmm...I wonder if you have too many messages saved in your Ki?  I've found they have limits
(01/24 02:42:27) To Kreel: ah - i'll delete a few and see, hang on...
(01/24 02:42:47) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: I have to delete photos all the time
(01/24 02:43:59) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: Let me know when to re-send
(01/24 02:46:51) To Kreel: ok - try again - that might have been it - even the DRC messages weren't showing up quite right...
(01/24 02:46:59) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: okay
(01/24 02:47:16) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: Just sent it
(01/24 02:48:06) To Kreel: got it. ok, note received and understood...:)
(01/24 02:48:15) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: Thanks
(01/24 02:48:29) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: I know we don't have much time..but let's at least meet by the fountain in the hood
(01/24 02:48:45) To Kreel: if you have a minute or two, we could meet back in my Teledahn and see if the aquarium reset...
(01/24 02:48:58) To Kreel: oh, ok, i'll see you at the fountain!
(01/24 02:49:06) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: on my way
(01/24 02:50:14) From Kreel: shorah, freind
(01/24 02:50:16) To Kreel: hi
(01/24 02:50:29) To Kreel: Shorah, and that means...? :)
(01/24 02:50:44) From Kreel: oh, sorry, Shandi told me it was "hello" in D'ni
(01/24 02:51:08) To Kreel: ah, ok. i'm a bit jealous, everyone sees my roomie more than i do...:)
(01/24 02:51:21) From Kreel: Let's got to your Relto and see if we can link into that room in Teledahn
(01/24 02:51:43) To Kreel: ok - one Relto book coming up
(01/24 02:52:49)  Kreel: ready?
(01/24 02:52:59) To Kreel: i set it to the journey cloth near the aquarium.
(01/24 02:55:10) To Kreel: and now it is open - even without ny touching it...
(01/24 02:55:18) Kreel hopes Irena can make it here
(01/24 02:55:35) From Kreel: hey
(01/24 02:55:40)  Irena: hey!
(01/24 02:55:52)  Kreel: Try the button...3 seconds or longer
(01/24 02:55:54)  Irena: it was open when i arrived...
(01/24 02:56:03)  Kreel: oh...so it is
(01/24 02:56:04)  Irena: do you see it open or closed?
(01/24 02:56:19)  Kreel: open
(01/24 02:56:24)  Kreel: you?
(01/24 02:56:27)  Irena: we need to share the book, correct?
(01/24 02:56:34)  Kreel: yes...share
(01/24 02:56:36)  Irena: open..
(01/24 02:56:50)  Kreel: where does it take us?
(01/24 02:57:43)  Kreel: not working?
(01/24 02:58:02) To Kreel: no - it gives me the share icon, but i can't ever get it to land on you...:(
(01/24 02:58:14)  Kreel: Shall I move
(01/24 02:58:25)  Kreel: try again...
(01/24 02:58:49)  Irena: damn! as soon as i back up to try to give it to you, i lose it...
(01/24 02:58:55)  Kreel: Shall i try?
(01/24 02:59:00)  Irena: it looks like it goes to a small room somewhere...
(01/24 02:59:18)  Irena: ok, ready
(01/24 03:01:06) From Kreel in D'ni-Ae'gura: test
(01/24 03:01:22)  Irena: uh-oh - looks like you went somewhere else?
(01/24 03:01:34) To Kreel: uh-oh - looks like you went somewhere else?
(01/24 03:02:03) From Kreel in D'ni-Ae'gura: Oh no...okay OOC for a moment...are we in different instances?
(01/24 03:02:28) To Kreel: OOC - kind of looks like it - i'm in the office, by myself..and you?
(01/24 03:02:58) From Kreel in D'ni-Ae'gura: same here...says I'm in D'ni Ae-Gura
(01/24 03:03:14) From Kreel in D'ni-Ae'gura: I hate temporal mechanics!
(01/24 03:03:52) To Kreel: it says i'm in Kreel's Baron's Office. wanted one each TARDIS, new or used...
(01/24 03:04:32) From Kreel in D'ni-Ae'gura: MY OFFICE????!!!  how did THAT happen...it was YOUR book!!
(01/24 03:04:48) To Kreel: a Douglas Sharper seems to have used this office - at least his notebook is here.
(01/24 03:04:53) From Kreel in D'ni-Ae'gura: I'll take a used TARDIS any day over this
(01/24 03:05:26) To Kreel: ok - here's something to try - let's meet back in the hood, link to Teledahn and touch the book without sharing it.
(01/24 03:05:36) From Kreel in D'ni-Ae'gura: We must both be here, but slightly out of phase or something
(01/24 03:05:56) From Kreel in D'ni-Ae'gura: okay..back to the fountain I go...
(01/24 03:05:56) To Kreel: must be it. at least the TARDIS had some diagnostics on board...
(01/24 03:07:35) From Kreel in Shandi's Bevin: okay back in the hood
(01/24 03:07:56) From Kreel: well that was wild
(01/24 03:08:22) To Kreel: that was indeed...i still don't quite get how these books do their thing...:(
(01/24 03:08:29) From Kreel: me either
(01/24 03:08:34) To Kreel: technology, i can kind of get, but this...very different...
(01/24 03:08:35) From Kreel: let's run your idea
(01/24 03:09:07) To Kreel: um - OOPS - be right back...
(01/24 03:10:33) To Kreel: after you!
(01/24 03:10:42) From Kreel: ok...what do we do again?
(01/24 03:11:07) To Kreel: link to the bedroom in Teledahn, the we each touch the office book, without sharing it, and see where we land.
(01/24 03:11:18) From Kreel: ah...got it
(01/24 03:13:00) Irena waves hello
(01/24 03:13:06) From Kreel: okay me first or you
(01/24 03:13:14) To Kreel: go ahead. :)
(01/24 03:13:19) From Kreel: okay
(01/24 03:13:26) Kreel braces himself
(01/24 03:14:18) From Kreel: okay...where does it say I am?
(01/24 03:14:38) From Kreel: or we are?
(01/24 03:14:51) Kreel says hey
(01/24 03:15:01) To Kreel: just says from Kreel. i'm checking my KI now...
(01/24 03:15:19) To Kreel: D'Ni Aegura
(01/24 03:15:24) From Kreel: mine just says D'ni Aegura
(01/24 03:15:34) From Kreel: Hmmm....
(01/24 03:15:46)  Irena: OOC - so is this the Main city instance or something else?
(01/24 03:15:47) From Kreel: We should have come here together when we shared...
(01/24 03:16:02)  Irena: yeah - i thought that was the Point of sharing...:)
(01/24 03:16:03) From Kreel: That I have no way to know
(01/24 03:16:26)  Irena: OOC - wonder if the neighborhood flags/IDs have some weird impact on the instancing...
(01/24 03:16:44) From Kreel: I think it is our own instance because if it was the regular city we'd have lots of Age players on our kis
(01/24 03:16:48)  Irena: remember, they said neighborhoods have city instances linked to them.
(01/24 03:17:04)  Irena: OOC - good point about the Age Players!
(01/24 03:17:34) From Kreel: I have another buddy in game right now...let me ask her where it says we are
(01/24 03:17:48)  Irena: remember the last time we did this - each time we couldn't share, but went through anyway, we landed together.
(01/24 03:18:02)  Kreel: True
(01/24 03:18:14)  Irena: BTW - that's OOC since it was Shandi and Kiril...:)
(01/24 03:18:46) From Kreel: Kimmie just told me we're in D'Ni Ae-Gura...well that was helpful
(01/24 03:18:52)  Irena: OOC - but the only time it looked like we were split was when we actually shared the Bahro stone in Gahreesen - then you seemed to be in a different city...
(01/24 03:19:17) From Kreel: OOC...yeah, somethings up with this instancing stuff
(01/24 03:19:28)  Irena: IC - ugh, this kind of thing can make your head hurt!
(01/24 03:19:43) From Kreel: Back to IC...
(01/24 03:20:07) Kreel is a bit puzzled...
(01/24 03:20:17)  Irena: i was thinking i can come back and read the Sharper diary later. maybe we should keep exploring?
(01/24 03:20:36)  Irena: puzzled? thoughts? :)
(01/24 03:20:48) From Kreel: How these books work
(01/24 03:21:19)  Kreel: And after reading some of Kiril's diary today...
(01/24 03:21:26)  Irena: yeah! someone must have some idea, right? and that Yeesha person was bragging about how she could Write Ages, if i remember right...
(01/24 03:21:46)  Kreel: Yeah...what does "write an age" mean anyway?
(01/24 03:22:05)  Irena: and - is this city, outside the windows, the one Yeesha was talking about, the one called Uru?
(01/24 03:22:18)  Kreel: That's my guess..
(01/24 03:22:32)  Irena: arg..:) so Many questions, so few answers so far.
(01/24 03:22:34)  Kreel: that tower sure looks like the one I saw earlier
(01/24 03:22:37) Kreel points
(01/24 03:23:03)  Irena: from the other office you were in?
(01/24 03:23:07)  Kreel: hey,,,there's another nook over here
(01/24 03:23:12)  Irena: it sure is pretty out there!
(01/24 03:23:25)  Kreel: well, yes, and also from the city itself.
(01/24 03:23:30)  Irena: yup - that's where i saw the diary, on the desk.
(01/24 03:23:37)  Kreel: look!
(01/24 03:23:39) Kreel points
(01/24 03:23:48)  Irena: a viewr and a stone
(01/24 03:24:04)  Irena: so - to share or not to share before we link...
(01/24 03:24:11)  Kreel: This stone...hmm
(01/24 03:24:27)  Kreel: looks like it goes back to where we were in Teledahn
(01/24 03:24:31)  Kreel: take a peek
(01/24 03:25:04)  Kreel: wanna try it?
(01/24 03:25:15)  Irena: so it does...looks like someplace new though. want to try it?
(01/24 03:25:20)  Kreel: sure
(01/24 03:25:27)  Irena: great minds and all  ;)
(01/24 03:26:53) Kreel cheers
(01/24 03:27:20)  Kreel: OOC...says we're in "Kreel's Teledahn"
(01/24 03:27:49)  Kreel: what are you doing?
(01/24 03:27:55)  Irena: OOC - yup - so from my Teledahn, to yours, very strange...
(01/24 03:28:16)  Kreel: OOC..I went first to Sharper's office...
(01/24 03:28:25)  Irena: was looking for you - you appear on my KI list long before you appear in person, so i was scanning and waiting ...:)
(01/24 03:28:33)  Kreel: And it was MY link, not yours
(01/24 03:28:45)  Kreel: Really?  I saw you the whole time
(01/24 03:28:58)  Irena: ooc - wonder if that is part of the deciding factor - who shares it out...
(01/24 03:29:05)  Kreel: OOC  How many bugs can you cram into one session?
(01/24 03:29:24)  Irena: hm...i was spinning in place, waiting to see you...
(01/24 03:29:40)  Irena: OOC - wonder if i have a few too many other things running in the backgound on my system...
(01/24 03:29:43)  Kreel: Okay...let's go back to the hood, then your Relto, to the office and this time YOU go first
(01/24 03:30:12)  Kreel: no wait...let's go to your Relto right from here..
(01/24 03:30:14) Kreel says DOH!
(01/24 03:30:31) Irena says DOH!
(01/24 03:31:18) To Kreel: UGH - Double DOH on that one...sigh...long day before i arrived in cavern i guess...
(01/24 03:31:22) To Kreel: see you in the hood.
(01/24 03:31:27) From Kreel in Kreel's Teledahn: I can't believe it..she forgot me again
(01/24 03:33:02) To Kreel: maybe i should consider dying my hair blonde...:)
(01/24 03:33:07) From Kreel: I'm beginning to get a complex
(01/24 03:33:16) Kreel roars with laughter
(01/24 03:34:31) To Kreel: so, how do i look blonde?
(01/24 03:34:35) From Kreel: wow...you have a multi colored shadwo
(01/24 03:34:39) From Kreel: shadow
(01/24 03:34:54) To Kreel: really? what colors?
(01/24 03:35:03) From Kreel: well it was red and blue
(01/24 03:35:14) To Kreel: did it change when i moved?
(01/24 03:35:14) From Kreel: you're blonde???
(01/24 03:35:21) Kreel takes a closer look
(01/24 03:35:25) Kreel starts to laugh
(01/24 03:35:31) Irena laughs
(01/24 03:35:41) From Kreel: fits for tonight...
(01/24 03:35:43) To Kreel: seemed appropriate for tonight
(01/24 03:35:51) From Kreel: lrotfl
(01/24 03:35:57) Kreel roars with laughter
(01/24 03:36:05) To Kreel: back to the aquarium?
(01/24 03:36:11) From Kreel: ok
(01/24 03:37:42) Irena waves hello
(01/24 03:37:48) Kreel says hey
(01/24 03:38:00) To Kreel: ok - i'm heading to the office...
(01/24 03:38:02) From Kreel: okay...last time I went first,,,this time you
(01/24 03:38:48) From Kreel: well...that worked
(01/24 03:39:03) To Kreel: well - same label - D'ni Aegura..
(01/24 03:39:05)  Kreel: OOC  I think we have our own "Hood" instance for the city
(01/24 03:39:18)  Kreel: does that make sense?
(01/24 03:39:34)  Irena: OOC - i think you're right..and it does make a bit of sense...:)
(01/24 03:39:37)  Kreel: blondie
(01/24 03:39:59)  Irena: uh, were you like uh talking to me, just now?  LOL
(01/24 03:40:11)  Kreel: okay...now you go first to the stone and share it with me..
(01/24 03:40:18)  Irena: ok
(01/24 03:40:23)  Kreel: let;s see where we end up
(01/24 03:40:42)  Irena: ready?
(01/24 03:40:45)  Kreel: ready
(01/24 03:42:07)  Irena: My Teledahn this time
(01/24 03:42:15)  Kreel: Yep
(01/24 03:42:25)  Kreel: so...whoever holds the stone is the key
(01/24 03:42:37)  Irena: so, first person to touch sets the place...
(01/24 03:42:41)  Kreel: I guess
(01/24 03:42:42)  Irena: very interesting...
(01/24 03:42:51)  Kreel: Look...I need to go...for now...;-9
(01/24 03:42:54)  Kreel: :-(
(01/24 03:43:08)  Irena: ok - great to see you again!
(01/24 03:43:19)  Irena: i might be back in tomoorrow, i hope!
(01/24 03:43:30)  Kreel: Remember not a word to Shandi about my peeking at Kiril's MYST diary
(01/24 03:43:37)  Kreel: I don't know what he'd do
(01/24 03:43:53)  Irena: ok - no mention, but i'll be looking through her stuff when she's not around - that's for sure!
(01/24 03:44:04)  Kreel: BE Careful!!!  
(01/24 03:44:11)  Irena: i will - you too!!
(01/24 03:44:17)  Kreel: I'll try to get another look when Kiril is gone
(01/24 03:44:31)  Kreel: I'll let you know what I find out...so check you Ki for messages
(01/24 03:44:37)  Kreel: Its the only safe way
(01/24 03:45:03)  Irena: i will, and i'll send you anything i find as well.
(01/24 03:45:25)  Kreel: okay...deal...I hope to back tomorrow night...but can't say for sure.
(01/24 03:45:41)  Irena: yeah - i don't know for certain either - hope to though.
(01/24 03:45:47)  Kreel: Okay...
(01/24 03:45:52) Kreel waves hello
(01/24 03:45:56)  Kreel: bye
(01/24 03:45:57) Irena waves hello

NEXT Session
/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

(01/26 02:54:43) Chat.log started...
missed the first bits - mentioned Shandi's disappearance over christmas break in 93-94, mentioned transcription of possible text docs - Kreel mentioned if in 93-94 might not have had as much access to computers

he was puzzled by the Game aspect of the disks on Shandi's shelf. - play with this a bit

(01/26 02:55:21) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: And if she also went to MYST like Kiril, she may not have been able to use a computer...
(01/26 02:55:37) To Kreel: true - although, the disk i found looks like either her diary from then or a transcription of a paper item. still, there are places in the apratment where she could have papers stashed.
(01/26 02:56:12) To Kreel: i'll be checking them out.
(01/26 02:56:27) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: Just keep your eyes open...there's more going on here than we've been told, that's for sure
(01/26 02:56:41) To Kreel: she doesn't tend to travel though. Kiril gives you an advantage with that...:)
(01/26 02:57:12) To Kreel: yeah - i do get that mushroom feeling about now - kept in the dark and fed, well, you know...:)
(01/26 02:57:50) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: Yes, with Kiril gone, I'll more of a chance to read those secre
(01/26 02:57:57) To Kreel: i'm curious why the levels of secrecy though. Kiril and you were close, Shandi and I are close, yet there's this wall of silence...
(01/26 02:58:06) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: secret books of his
(01/26 02:58:19) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: I wish I knew the answer to that one..
(01/26 02:59:35) To Kreel: I'm thinking of asking Shandi if I can play her MYST games, once i've checked them for more data disks or notes...think that is wise, or should i stay low-key?
(01/26 03:00:20) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: You might just start by asking her what they are and see what she says.  You could tell her that you heard others mention MYST
(01/26 03:03:37) To Kreel: good idea. i'll try that when i see her, either tonight or in the morning.
(01/26 03:03:58) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: Well...the surface is calling....
(01/26 03:04:26) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: I'll be around some this weekend and hope to spend more time here.  I'd like to continue in Teledahn with you.
(01/26 03:05:24) To Kreel: ok - i should have some time saturday or sunday - it would be fun to continue!!
(01/26 03:05:41) To Kreel: i'll send more data when i find it - you take care, and be careful!
(01/26 03:06:02) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: okay...you, too.  Caution is the word!!
(01/26 03:06:16) To Kreel: it is indeed!
(01/26 03:06:39) ...Chat.log stopped.

/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
NEXT session
/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

(02/06 01:25:56) Chat.log started...
(02/06 01:26:13) To Kreel: Shorah!
(02/06 01:26:37) From Kreel in Shandi's Bevin: Meet me in the hood by the fountain?
(02/06 01:26:50) To Kreel: i'll be right there!
(02/06 01:27:37) Irena bows
(02/06 01:27:38) From Kreel: hey there
(02/06 01:27:44) Kreel bows
(02/06 01:27:47) To Kreel: heya!
(02/06 01:28:00) From Kreel: seems like months
(02/06 01:28:09) To Kreel: we got one of the shiny hoods! Lights, clock, beach ball...:)
(02/06 01:28:15) From Kreel: clock?
(02/06 01:28:20) To Kreel: yes - it seems like way too long
(02/06 01:28:28) To Kreel: clock - over by the linking room.
(02/06 01:28:43) From Kreel: I've got something to show you there
(02/06 01:28:54) Kreel beckons you
(02/06 01:29:00) To Kreel: at least i think it's a clock - it seems to move in a time-kind of fashion...
(02/06 01:29:26) From Kreel: that?
(02/06 01:29:31) Kreel points
(02/06 01:29:43) To Kreel: yup - that's what i was thinking anyway...
(02/06 01:29:52) Kreel looks it over
(02/06 01:30:13) From Kreel: hmm... could be a clock
(02/06 01:30:31) From Kreel: that number there is what?
(02/06 01:30:37) To Kreel: has Kiril taught you how to read the numbers? i haven't gotten it down yet, myself...:(
(02/06 01:30:57) From Kreel: I found some in the classroom over there
(02/06 01:30:57) To Kreel: ah, answers my question - i'm not sure either...
(02/06 01:31:00) Kreel points
(02/06 01:31:07) To Kreel: cool, lets go look!
(02/06 01:32:10) From Kreel: see around the walls?
(02/06 01:32:33) To Kreel: i see...any idea what the starting place is?
(02/06 01:32:37) From Kreel: starts over here...
(02/06 01:32:40) Kreel points
(02/06 01:33:37) From Kreel: at least I think so
(02/06 01:34:29)  Kreel: I also found the same symbols in one of the books in my Relto.
(02/06 01:34:43)  Kreel: I think you have it, too
(02/06 01:35:02) To Kreel: oh, yeah, the one refering to the symbols on the four pillars...
(02/06 01:35:09)  Kreel: right
(02/06 01:35:26) To Kreel: ok, so, on the wall to the right the first symbol looks like the first page marker...
(02/06 01:35:30)  Kreel: Seems to be based off 5 somehow
(02/06 01:36:10)  Kreel: well.. I can't see back there, but the others seem to match up in order
(02/06 01:36:22) To Kreel: yeah...so the number on the thing outside is, what, 20?
(02/06 01:36:46) To Kreel: oops, maybe more like 19...
(02/06 01:36:53)  Kreel: yeah...19
(02/06 01:36:57) To Kreel: counting along the wall behind you...
(02/06 01:37:11)  Kreel: so...is it 1900 hundred hours?
(02/06 01:38:31) To Kreel: hmmm...what does my KI say?
(02/06 01:38:57)  Kreel: Mine says 18:37
(02/06 01:39:11)  Kreel: maybe it moves right to left?
(02/06 01:39:33) To Kreel: yeah, mine too... maybe it does at that - we can come back and look after some time has passed...
(02/06 01:39:47)  Kreel: okay
(02/06 01:39:54)  Kreel: Let me show you something else
(02/06 01:39:56)  Kreel: come
(02/06 01:39:59) To Kreel: Teledahn?
(02/06 01:40:15) To Kreel: ok - right behind you...
(02/06 01:40:34)  Kreel: notice anything in here
(02/06 01:40:44)  Kreel: that!
(02/06 01:40:47) Kreel points
(02/06 01:40:47) To Kreel: two more books
(02/06 01:41:02)  Kreel: this one looks like some sort of garden
(02/06 01:41:15)  Irena: it does...
(02/06 01:41:27)  Kreel: that one looks like a machine
(02/06 01:41:29)  Irena: and this one like some kind of small room.
(02/06 01:41:48)  Kreel: I say...let's go back to Teledahn
(02/06 01:42:17)  Irena: sounds good!
(02/06 01:42:35)  Irena: ready for a share?
(02/06 01:42:38)  Kreel: yup
(02/06 01:43:47)  Irena: after you?
(02/06 01:43:53)  Kreel: here we go..
(02/06 01:45:55)  Kreel: well we made it
(02/06 01:46:04)  Irena: odd...i linked after you, yet arrived before...temporal shift?
(02/06 01:46:13)  Kreel: I hate temporal mechanics!!
(02/06 01:46:16) Kreel starts to laugh
(02/06 01:46:20) Irena laughs
(02/06 01:46:34)  Kreel: did you remember your antihistimine this time
(02/06 01:46:52)  Irena: so, scary thought - i hit the zero box under the book at first - what happens if you remove an age with somebody in it?
(02/06 01:47:10)  Irena: yes i did - let's see how it works...
(02/06 01:47:16)  Kreel: Good
(02/06 01:47:22)  Kreel: Take a look at this map...
(02/06 01:47:41) Kreel gets up so Irena can see it
(02/06 01:48:16)  Kreel: what do you think?
(02/06 01:48:22)  Irena: interesting - more of those numbers...
(02/06 01:48:35)  Irena: maybe a key to a lock or the positions of something?
(02/06 01:48:41) Irena shrugs
(02/06 01:48:44)  Kreel: yes...I wrote them down in my notes...
(02/06 01:48:47) Kreel shrugs
(02/06 01:48:59)  Irena: cool! 
(02/06 01:49:02)  Kreel: It looks more like a place, don't you think?
(02/06 01:49:21)  Irena: it does - like a cave or the inside of a weird shroom...
(02/06 01:49:34)  Kreel: Right
(02/06 01:49:36)  Irena: haven't seen anything like it yet
(02/06 01:49:52)  Kreel: Do you remember that ladder under the hut when we first got here?
(02/06 01:50:01)  Irena: but the other papers have been useful, so i bet that one is as well.
(02/06 01:50:13)  Irena: yes, i was going to suggest the ladder...:)
(02/06 01:50:25)  Kreel: Let's go down and take a look
(02/06 01:50:35)  Irena: could you try not to fall through that small space again? that was really scary!!
(02/06 01:50:45)  Kreel: so far, so good
(02/06 01:51:37)  Kreel: well, let's hope you're medicine is working
(02/06 01:51:49)  Kreel: look...no water
(02/06 01:52:02)  Irena: didn't we leave this open?
(02/06 01:52:14)  Irena: wonder who else has been here...
(02/06 01:52:16)  Kreel: nope...we couldn't open it at all, remeber
(02/06 01:52:33)  Irena: hmm - i knew it was a long week...sigh...:)
(02/06 01:52:46)  Kreel: woo hoo...wonder woman
(02/06 01:53:02)  Irena: those trips to the gym actually made a difference!
(02/06 01:53:11)  Kreel: you're not kiddin
(02/06 01:53:21)  Irena: um, i know they say ladies first, but it Smells down there!
(02/06 01:54:23)  Irena: OOF, rotting things, wow...:(
(02/06 01:54:24)  Kreel: what a lovely smell
(02/06 01:54:39)  Kreel: what's that?
(02/06 01:54:42) Kreel points
(02/06 01:55:02) Kreel sneezes
(02/06 01:55:13)  Kreel: Man...you think this smells...just wait
(02/06 01:55:22) To Kreel: uh oh - something really bad down there?
(02/06 01:55:35) Kreel holds his nose
(02/06 01:55:55)  Kreel: yuck!!!
(02/06 01:56:03)  Kreel: why are we down here?
(02/06 01:56:03) Irena chokes back the gag reflex and tried not to breath..
(02/06 01:56:26)  Kreel: This doesn't look promising
(02/06 01:56:36)  Kreel: a sewerr pipe?
(02/06 01:56:40)  Irena: yeah...:(
(02/06 01:56:51)  Kreel: less water here
(02/06 01:57:13)  Irena: light ahead
(02/06 01:57:20)  Kreel: I see some light ahead
(02/06 01:57:35)  Kreel: holes in pipe
(02/06 01:57:44) Kreel looks around for a bit
(02/06 01:57:48) Irena sucks in a deep breath from the small breeze
(02/06 01:58:01)  Kreel: are you sure about this?
(02/06 01:58:18)  Kreel: Symbols
(02/06 01:58:20)  Irena: no, but it smells just a bit better here...
(02/06 01:58:30)  Kreel: and a hole!!
(02/06 01:58:38)  Kreel: stairs
(02/06 01:59:00)  Kreel: smells better up here
(02/06 01:59:03) Kreel sneezes
(02/06 01:59:18) To Kreel: those symbols were shackled together - that doesn't look pleasant!
(02/06 01:59:28)  Kreel: look
(02/06 01:59:29) Error: Don't know how to '/whew'
(02/06 01:59:31) Kreel points
(02/06 01:59:56)  Kreel: what was that noise??
(02/06 02:00:00) Kreel cringes
(02/06 02:00:02) Error: Don't know how to '/catchbreath'
(02/06 02:00:22)  Kreel: are we in a prison?
(02/06 02:00:29) To Kreel: one of those things in the floor moved. did you step on it?
(02/06 02:00:53)  Kreel: step on that one
(02/06 02:01:09)  Kreel: Hmmm...some sort of touchpads?
(02/06 02:01:11)  Irena: what happened?
(02/06 02:01:21)  Kreel: nothing that I can see
(02/06 02:01:24)  Irena: why would you put touch pads in a cell?
(02/06 02:01:34)  Kreel: Good question
(02/06 02:01:50)  Kreel: Maybe they were some sort of torture device
(02/06 02:02:04)  Irena: can i just say EWWWWW
(02/06 02:02:11)  Kreel: sorry...
(02/06 02:02:40)  Kreel: There's door here, but its locked...and an open one beyond
(02/06 02:02:47)  Irena: bowls - looks like they weren't completely starved...
(02/06 02:03:18)  Kreel: those bones are big...what do you think they were?
(02/06 02:03:31)  Kreel: that ain't no cow
(02/06 02:03:53)  Kreel: stools, stones, bowls, bones...wierd
(02/06 02:03:55)  Irena: inmates or the keepers, i wonder...
(02/06 02:04:06)  Kreel: another door
(02/06 02:04:28)  Kreel: Hmmm...how many of those pad thingies are there?
(02/06 02:04:37)  Irena: and a weird panel of something over on the far wall
(02/06 02:05:01)  Kreel: I count 7
(02/06 02:05:04)  Irena: looks like seven pads, why?
(02/06 02:05:18)  Kreel: look at those panel things again
(02/06 02:05:21)  Irena: oh, there are seven things on the wall - related, maybe?
(02/06 02:05:27)  Kreel: that's my guess
(02/06 02:05:44)  Irena: if i step on a pad, does anything happen on the panel thing?
(02/06 02:05:49)  Kreel: let me look
(02/06 02:06:02)  Kreel: nothing
(02/06 02:06:05)  Kreel: step off
(02/06 02:06:07)  Kreel: nope
(02/06 02:06:23)  Kreel: there's 4 up and  3 down on that wall, though
(02/06 02:06:36)  Irena: yeah, hmmm...
(02/06 02:06:45)  Kreel: 4 up, 3 down....
(02/06 02:07:00)  Irena: so would that be 3 pads down to match?
(02/06 02:07:16)  Kreel: that would make sense...but which three?
(02/06 02:07:50)  Irena: ok - do we know if the D'ni count left to right or right to left?
(02/06 02:08:03)  Kreel: here's what I see...1 is down, 2 up, 3 down, 4 up, 5 down, 6 & 7 up
(02/06 02:08:27)  Irena: ok, sounds reasonable...
(02/06 02:08:37)  Kreel: well, in the classroom it was left to right
(02/06 02:08:43)  Kreel: and so is the book
(02/06 02:08:46)  Irena: wait - that diagram you had - do those panels look like these pads?
(02/06 02:09:00) Kreel looks around for a bit
(02/06 02:09:15) Kreel checks his notes
(02/06 02:09:20)  Kreel: Yes!!!
(02/06 02:09:29)  Kreel: That map was this place
(02/06 02:09:40)  Kreel: That's the hole in the middle of the map
(02/06 02:09:42) Kreel points
(02/06 02:09:50)  Kreel: this pillar
(02/06 02:10:00)  Irena: and the pattern looks right on the floor...
(02/06 02:10:55)  Irena: so - we have to hold down the three somehow...the 3 from the diagram-map
(02/06 02:10:56)  Kreel: okay so that means 1,3 and 5 are down...that's these here
(02/06 02:11:28)  Kreel: That one
(02/06 02:11:31) Kreel points
(02/06 02:11:41)  Irena: this one?
(02/06 02:11:41)  Kreel: this one
(02/06 02:11:52)  Kreel: and that one...
(02/06 02:11:55) Kreel points
(02/06 02:12:24)  Kreel: do you think this bone would work
(02/06 02:12:34)  Irena: it looks heavy enough
(02/06 02:13:04)  Kreel: I was not good at soccer
(02/06 02:13:13)  Kreel: missed
(02/06 02:13:19)  Kreel: Rocks will work
(02/06 02:14:07)  Kreel: maybe the basket
(02/06 02:14:39)  Irena: ok, i'll work on getting a rock on this one
(02/06 02:14:44)  Kreel: that did it
(02/06 02:14:58)  Kreel: and she's coming in for the big goal...
(02/06 02:15:08)  Kreel: close
(02/06 02:15:38)  Kreel: walk into backwards
(02/06 02:15:53)  Kreel: damn
(02/06 02:16:51)  Kreel: so close
(02/06 02:17:13)  Kreel: that rock
(02/06 02:17:16)  Kreel: score
(02/06 02:17:43)  Kreel: hmmm...nothing changed...were still blocked
(02/06 02:17:52)  Irena: ok....maybe it's a mirror image thing? four down, three up?
(02/06 02:18:02)  Kreel: hmmm....
(02/06 02:18:11)  Kreel: okay...let's try that
(02/06 02:18:49)  Kreel: Ouch!!!  stubbed my toe
(02/06 02:19:09)  Irena: got one!!!
(02/06 02:19:19)  Kreel: me too
(02/06 02:19:43)  Kreel: there's two
(02/06 02:20:22)  Kreel: can you get that one?
(02/06 02:20:44)  Kreel: THat's it
(02/06 02:20:54)  Kreel: the door opened
(02/06 02:21:17)  Kreel: now that one is shut...
(02/06 02:21:25) To Kreel: ewww, more chains...:(
(02/06 02:21:31)  Kreel: Is this a joke!
(02/06 02:21:54)  Irena: holding tank? can't be opened with the cells at the same time?
(02/06 02:22:10)  Kreel: Well...I haven't been to prison...but that would make sense
(02/06 02:22:31) To Kreel: i had a friend who was a cop - it kind of worked that way in the temporary cells...
(02/06 02:22:45)  Irena: damn, no labels....
(02/06 02:22:47)  Kreel: look at these handels
(02/06 02:22:59)  Irena: they set something...
(02/06 02:22:59)  Kreel (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):  
(02/06 02:23:07)  Kreel: what did I just do?
(02/06 02:23:18)  Irena: you closed the cells and opened the other door!!
(02/06 02:23:23)  Kreel: cool
(02/06 02:23:26)  Kreel: lead on
(02/06 02:23:50)  Irena: you know, this is really kind of creepy...
(02/06 02:24:07)  Irena: wonder who or what they were keeping...
(02/06 02:24:08)  Kreel: well,it is a dungeon of some sort..
(02/06 02:24:20)  Kreel: you don't wantto know
(02/06 02:24:47)  Irena: wow - nice view here though.
(02/06 02:25:17)  Kreel: more shrooms
(02/06 02:25:27)  Kreel: and those floppy thing
(02/06 02:25:30)  Irena: yeah, i probably don't want to know, still, never hurts to know what a group considers to be the "dangerous" ones...
(02/06 02:25:57)  Irena: nice waterfall in the distance
(02/06 02:26:02) Error: Don't know how to '/gesturesmall'
(02/06 02:26:11)  Kreel: yes
(02/06 02:26:44)  Kreel: what is that thing
(02/06 02:26:47) Kreel points
(02/06 02:27:12)  Kreel: some kind of bridge
(02/06 02:27:32)  Irena: jammed?
(02/06 02:27:39)  Kreel: you try it
(02/06 02:28:16)  Kreel: well...back on the farm we had door that stuck...a good kick did the trick
(02/06 02:28:17)  Irena: doesn't move when i push on it...
(02/06 02:28:31)  Kreel: try it now
(02/06 02:28:39)  Irena: wicked - that did the trick
(02/06 02:28:53)  Kreel: what is that!
(02/06 02:28:56)  Irena: what's this?
(02/06 02:29:17)  Kreel: what did it do?
(02/06 02:29:29)  Irena: sprayed a fountain of spores. a feeder?
(02/06 02:29:39) From Kreel: to feed what?
(02/06 02:29:42) Kreel cowers
(02/06 02:29:48)  Irena: uh, i don't know...
(02/06 02:29:50) Irena shrugs
(02/06 02:30:00)  Kreel: I don't like this
(02/06 02:30:03)  Irena: ugh - i hope nothing Large!
(02/06 02:30:19)  Irena: leaving now....:)
(02/06 02:30:40)  Kreel: you need to go?
(02/06 02:31:03)  Irena: away from the feeder, yes! if it calls something, maybe i don't want to meet it...:)
(02/06 02:31:09)  Kreel: oh, right
(02/06 02:31:34)  Irena: then i was trying to see if the flying thing we saw before ate spores, but it didn't look like it...
(02/06 02:31:47)  Kreel: look more stuff
(02/06 02:31:59)  Kreel: someone's been here!
(02/06 02:32:14)  Irena: yeah - this is current stuff
(02/06 02:32:28)  Kreel: wonder what is or was in these crates
(02/06 02:32:42)  Irena: they say fishtanks.com
(02/06 02:33:07)  Kreel: Fishtanks?
(02/06 02:33:11)  Irena: no shipping labels though
(02/06 02:33:21)  Kreel: And cable spools...
(02/06 02:33:29)  Irena: that's a lot of tanks...
(02/06 02:33:52)  Kreel: Here's a door
(02/06 02:33:52)  Irena: look up - i think i see where some of the rope went....
(02/06 02:34:02) Kreel looks around for a bit
(02/06 02:34:08)  Kreel: oh yeah
(02/06 02:34:20)  Kreel: Those stones look like wieghts
(02/06 02:34:41)  Irena: looks like one attaches to that ladder
(02/06 02:35:00)  Kreel: could be
(02/06 02:35:09)  Irena: and there's a cloth under it...
(02/06 02:35:15)  Kreel: oh yea
(02/06 02:35:37)  Kreel: too high to jump
(02/06 02:36:08)  Kreel: can you jump that?
(02/06 02:36:16)  Irena: it's possible here - but i'm not sure about the gap....
(02/06 02:36:28)  Kreel: I'll catch you
(02/06 02:36:36)  Kreel: ready
(02/06 02:36:40)  Irena: ok...
(02/06 02:36:48)  Kreel: woot
(02/06 02:36:57)  Irena: Whew!!
(02/06 02:37:43)  Irena: can't get to the ladder though...
(02/06 02:37:54) Kreel looks up
(02/06 02:38:04)  Kreel: I think you'reright about the ladder
(02/06 02:39:15)  Irena: dead end over here - can't get any further around or back down either...
(02/06 02:39:27)  Kreel: let's try the door
(02/06 02:39:59)  Kreel: something that opens without a lock..that's scary
(02/06 02:40:29)  Irena: yeah - either isn't important or they forgot...
(02/06 02:40:30)  Kreel: something here
(02/06 02:40:51)  Kreel: what do you make of it?
(02/06 02:41:00)  Irena: i think the damp faded it - i can't really read the script
(02/06 02:41:24)  Kreel: hmmm...
(02/06 02:41:30)  Irena: same with this orange piece
(02/06 02:41:37)  Kreel: you know that big thing you didn't want to meet?  I think this is it!
(02/06 02:41:53)  Irena: oh my....youch!
(02/06 02:42:20)  Kreel: another door up there
(02/06 02:42:22) Kreel points
(02/06 02:42:31)  Irena: yeah - lets see where that goes...
(02/06 02:43:07)  Irena: no lock here either - just a tunnel into the rock.
(02/06 02:43:40)  Kreel: what the??
(02/06 02:43:46)  Irena: wow - check out the door - looks kind of like that tree one in the cleft...
(02/06 02:44:18)  Kreel: nothing?
(02/06 02:44:38)  Irena: nothing - a very faint glow and that's it...
(02/06 02:45:05)  Kreel: another cloth!
(02/06 02:45:09)  Irena: ahha - a cloth!
(02/06 02:45:44)  Kreel: Looks like we only have one to go
(02/06 02:45:50)  Irena: what's that on the ground behind you?
(02/06 02:46:00)  Kreel: Odd light
(02/06 02:46:22)  Irena: yeah - i've seen that symbol somewhere - on pillars in my Relto...
(02/06 02:46:49)  Irena: two passages - left or right?
(02/06 02:46:55)  Kreel: Which way?
(02/06 02:47:03)  Irena: left?
(02/06 02:48:18)  Irena: weird machine and another feeder...
(02/06 02:48:33)  Irena: don't know about you, but i think i'll leave the feeder alone...
(02/06 02:48:58)  Kreel: is that a telescope
(02/06 02:49:29)  Irena: not sure - lots of buttons, kind of like that sun tracking thing we found erlier
(02/06 02:49:35)  Irena: take a look...
(02/06 02:50:05)  Irena: shit, what the frell was that?
(02/06 02:50:06)  Kreel: umm...its a GUN!!!
(02/06 02:50:19)  Kreel: I pushed the flashing blue light and it fired
(02/06 02:50:25)  Kreel: I almost hit that flying thing
(02/06 02:50:30)  Irena: damn - that's a big-ass gun...
(02/06 02:50:34) Kreel does not like guns
(02/06 02:50:47)  Irena: me neither...:(
(02/06 02:51:37)  Irena: ok - blue button fired it. maybe we should aim it away from the water? in case it goes off again?
(02/06 02:51:55)  Kreel: okay...you try it
(02/06 02:51:59)  Irena: think those others might move it - without firing it?
(02/06 02:52:14)  Kreel: ladies first
(02/06 02:52:17) Irena approaches very cautiously...
(02/06 02:52:49)  Kreel: it's turning
(02/06 02:53:31)  Kreel: well
(02/06 02:53:41)  Irena: ok - it's pointing into the rock under the crates right now.
(02/06 02:53:52)  Kreel: letme
(02/06 02:54:03)  Kreel: let me see
(02/06 02:54:08)  Irena: the other controls move it or zoom it's targeting scope in and out. didn't find a safety though...
(02/06 02:54:08)  Kreel (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):  
(02/06 02:55:20)  Kreel: got the rock
(02/06 02:55:35)  Irena: good on rocks i see...
(02/06 02:55:50)  Irena: huh - wonder if we can get the one holding the ladder?
(02/06 02:55:54)  Kreel: Hmmm...I wonder if we shoot those rocks if the ladder will fall?
(02/06 02:56:06)  Kreel: How's your aim?
(02/06 02:56:13)  Irena: i'll try, unless you want to...
(02/06 02:57:31)  Kreel: get it?
(02/06 02:57:43)  Irena: got it. it's scarily easy to use...
(02/06 02:57:53)  Kreel: the ladder is down
(02/06 02:57:57)  Kreel: good one
(02/06 02:58:09)  Irena: looks like it's back to the ledge for the ladder...
(02/06 02:58:14)  Kreel: okay
(02/06 02:58:18)  Irena: want to check the other passage on the way?
(02/06 02:58:34)  Kreel: yes
(02/06 02:58:40)  Irena: lead on...
(02/06 02:58:59)  Irena: did you hear that!!!!!?????
(02/06 02:59:15)  Kreel: what was that?
(02/06 02:59:20)  Irena: that beast sound in the distance??
(02/06 02:59:29)  Kreel: uh oh...
(02/06 02:59:41)  Kreel: maybe our shooting awakened something
(02/06 02:59:52)  Irena: maybe...set out carefully?
(02/06 03:00:28)  Kreel: isn't that where we were?
(02/06 03:00:32) Kreel points
(02/06 03:00:43)  Irena: yeah - wow! full circle
(02/06 03:01:13)  Irena: a gate? but for what?
(02/06 03:01:16)  Kreel: did I release or capture something just now?
(02/06 03:01:34)  Irena: the gate dropped....so released, maybe?
(02/06 03:01:43)  Kreel: How can we know?
(02/06 03:02:28)  Kreel: dead end
(02/06 03:02:40)  Irena: can we jump across?
(02/06 03:02:58)  Irena: although, we'd have to get back then...
(02/06 03:03:07)  Kreel: but we couldn't get back up
(02/06 03:03:33)  Kreel: I vote for the ladder
(02/06 03:03:35)  Irena: true - not a good plan...:)
(02/06 03:03:42)  Irena: yup - ladder it is!!
(02/06 03:03:57)  Irena: besides, this diamond plate, a little harsh on the feet...
(02/06 03:04:14)  Kreel: are you barefoot?
(02/06 03:04:26) To Kreel: always
(02/06 03:05:45)  Kreel: yep...the ladder is down now!
(02/06 03:06:32) Kreel looks around for a bit
(02/06 03:06:42)  Irena: stash o books...
(02/06 03:06:48)  Kreel: looks like an office
(02/06 03:06:58)  Kreel: look behind you..a cloth
(02/06 03:07:10)  Irena: wicked!
(02/06 03:07:57)  Kreel: do you think that door will open now?
(02/06 03:08:00)  Irena: was that weird sound you, or something else??
(02/06 03:08:14)  Kreel: not me
(02/06 03:08:30)  Irena: i was afraid of that.
(02/06 03:08:53)  Irena: wonder where the passage goes? these documents are unreadable...:(
(02/06 03:08:54)  Kreel: another door
(02/06 03:09:23)  Kreel: anotheer door...
(02/06 03:09:31)  Irena: locked?
(02/06 03:09:31)  Kreel (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):  
(02/06 03:09:40)  Kreel: nope
(02/06 03:10:01)  Kreel: this is where we came in
(02/06 03:10:08)  Irena: well...a "secret" office...
(02/06 03:10:18)  Kreel: why, I wonder?
(02/06 03:10:26)  Irena: this guy seems like he was a bit on the paranoid side.
(02/06 03:10:32)  Kreel: I'll say
(02/06 03:10:55)  Irena: shall we try the door?
(02/06 03:10:59)  Kreel: sure
(02/06 03:11:33)  Irena: hey - do you see a linking stone off the side of the platform here?
(02/06 03:11:45)  Kreel: where?
(02/06 03:11:47)  Irena: have to come back to that!
(02/06 03:12:14)  Irena: down there - under us
(02/06 03:12:19)  Kreel: oh yeah...
(02/06 03:12:56)  Irena: ok...ready?
(02/06 03:13:09)  Kreel: I'll need to go back to the surface after this.
(02/06 03:13:19)  Irena: ok.
(02/06 03:13:26) Irena takes a deep breath
(02/06 03:13:26)  Kreel: try it
(02/06 03:14:54)  Irena: wow!
(02/06 03:15:37) From Kreel in ???: where am I?
(02/06 03:15:53) To Kreel: i don't know - i'm in a blue room with Yeesha talking...
(02/06 03:15:53) From Kreel (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):  
(02/06 03:16:01) From Kreel in ???: me too
(02/06 03:16:22) To Kreel: interesting - but not the same room....very strange!
(02/06 03:16:28) From Kreel in ???: wow...I touched the hand thing and this pillar thing disappeared
(02/06 03:17:04) To Kreel: wow - very interesting, indeed!!
(02/06 03:17:05) From Kreel in ???: there's 3 other pillar things here
(02/06 03:17:34) To Kreel: so i see. so the D'ni imprisoned beings to do their work...
(02/06 03:17:51) To Kreel: i'm going to try and jump for another pillar...
(02/06 03:18:26) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: Irena..that pillar thing is in my Relto!!
(02/06 03:18:58) To Kreel: mine too. wicked cool!
(02/06 03:19:12) To Kreel: i missed the other ledge and fell through a star field - how about you?
(02/06 03:19:36) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: Yes...I tried to jump across and ended up here
(02/06 03:19:45) To Kreel: meet in the hood?
(02/06 03:19:57) From Kreel in Kreel's Relto: okay...justf for a moment
(02/06 03:21:01) From Kreel: That was fun
(02/06 03:21:08)  Irena: well, that was a strange thing.
(02/06 03:21:20)  Kreel: what?
(02/06 03:21:26)  Irena: wonder what the other pillars have in their books? :)
(02/06 03:21:36)  Kreel: Me too!!
(02/06 03:21:52)  Irena: the strange blue cave, a pole, and all the talk about the least and Bahro souls...
(02/06 03:22:01)  Kreel: Make a mental note to return to that stone
(02/06 03:22:14)  Irena: next time we're here we'll have to try another book :)
(02/06 03:22:18)  Kreel: Yes...something awful happened in those cells
(02/06 03:22:44)  Kreel: Okay...next time, my Relto
(02/06 03:22:53)  Irena: true - hope there was some release for the prisoners in the end, at least...
(02/06 03:23:10)  Irena: ok - sounds good! your Relto that is.
(02/06 03:23:36)  Kreel: Well, surface is calling.  Have a great evening, or morning, or day, or whatever is up there
(02/06 03:23:39)  Irena: not the whole prison thing.
(02/06 03:23:51)  Irena: ok - you too! see you soon i hope. :)
(02/06 03:24:02)  Kreel: Shorah, my friend.
(02/06 03:24:05) Irena gives Kreel a quick hug
(02/06 03:24:14)  Irena: Sharoh!
(02/06 03:24:40) ...Chat.log stopped.

(03/02 03:58:06) Chat.log started...
(03/02 03:59:30)  JWPlatt: scuze!  :)
(03/02 03:59:52)  ResEng B. Mathias: Shorah All.
(03/02 03:59:57)  JWPlatt: Shorah!
(03/02 04:00:06)  ResEng B. Mathias: Welcome to the Orientation Session.
(03/02 04:00:14) kd5piq kneels down...
(03/02 04:00:24)  ResEng B. Mathias: any one here new to the cavern?
(03/02 04:00:26) Wayneji waves hello
(03/02 04:00:36) kd5piq waves hello
(03/02 04:00:37)  JWPlatt: Holy cow
(03/02 04:00:54) Irena waves hello
(03/02 04:00:58)  OTLaxguy: I am new
(03/02 04:01:13)  JWPlatt: Sorry to interrupt, but did something strange just happen?
(03/02 04:01:24)  ResEng B. Mathias: Welcome OtL.
(03/02 04:01:41)  ResEng B. Mathias: LIke what JW?
(03/02 04:02:20)  JWPlatt: I found myself walking uncontrollably toward the door, then I was outside the door pressing the button, and walking in again.  Very odd.  Then there's that Bahro scream again..
(03/02 04:02:40)  ResEng B. Mathias: Shorah, all.  I'm ResEng
(03/02 04:02:51)  ResEng B. Mathias: B. Mathias
(03/02 04:03:07)  Wayneji: Hi
(03/02 04:03:11)  ResEng B. Mathias: JW, I've had that happen several times tonight.
(03/02 04:03:22)  ResEng B. Mathias: I'll be covering the following topics
(03/02 04:03:59)  Illuvatar: greetgreetings and salutations, let us drink Tranya!  I hope you relish it as much as I!
(03/02 04:04:06)  ResEng B. Mathias: 1) getting help, 2) sight seeing, 3) history of D'ni and the DRC, 4) Linking   and then a Q&A session....please hold all questions till the Q&A
(03/02 04:04:33)  ResEng B. Mathias: There are many forms of help.
(03/02 04:04:54)  ResEng B. Mathias: The Notebook in front of me covers the operation of the KI.
(03/02 04:04:59) JWPlatt thinksIlluvatar is a kindred spirit
(03/02 04:05:46)  ResEng B. Mathias: One of the Telepromters in the fountain area gives a list of emotes.
(03/02 04:06:29)  ResEng B. Mathias: The DRC website (drcsite.org) is full of usefull information including FAQ's and a forum)
(03/02 04:07:12)  ResEng B. Mathias: ResEng's like myself, give Orientation Sessions, help you if you get stuck (like in a wall) or if you have problems with another explorer.
(03/02 04:07:21)  ResEng B. Mathias: We are available 24/7
(03/02 04:07:52)  ResEng B. Mathias: You can contact us using your wrench on your toolbelt (where you Relto Book and KI can be accessed)
(03/02 04:08:42)  ResEng B. Mathias: ResEng's do NOT provide help for cavern exploration...ie we won't help you with puzzles you might find.
(03/02 04:08:50)  ResEng B. Mathias: But FEAR not!
(03/02 04:09:01) JWPlatt cowers
(03/02 04:09:12)  En'duruin: hello everyone
(03/02 04:09:26)  ResEng B. Mathias: The Guild of Greeters (GOG) have volunteered to provide help a ResEng is not allowed to give.
(03/02 04:09:49)  ResEng B. Mathias: the GOG can give suggestions, hints, etc.
(03/02 04:09:59) Wayneji laughs
(03/02 04:10:14)  ResEng B. Mathias: If you ask for a hint/spoiler, please do so via private messages.
(03/02 04:10:16)  Tubros: Hi
(03/02 04:10:25)  Tubros: Yes
(03/02 04:10:38) JWPlatt Greets Dalken and politely promises not to do anything rude with his harmonica if he'll just let me play it once.
(03/02 04:10:55) Dalken Starbyne hides his harmonica defensively
(03/02 04:10:56)  ResEng B. Mathias: You can contact the GOG in their neighborhood, accessable via the Nexus and their public 'hood link.
(03/02 04:11:11)  Tubros: Just getting started
(03/02 04:11:17)  TDream URU: hi three
(03/02 04:11:19)  TDream URU: there
(03/02 04:11:25)  ResEng B. Mathias: Another great source of help is your fellow explorers!
(03/02 04:11:27) JWPlatt is very sad...
(03/02 04:11:28)  Tubros: Greetings
(03/02 04:11:43)  ResEng B. Mathias: You can meet them in your 'hood, public 'hoods and the city.
(03/02 04:12:03)  ResEng B. Mathias: Most explorers are more than willing to give help
(03/02 04:12:22)  ResEng B. Mathias: And asking for help is a great way to make some new friends.
(03/02 04:12:49)  ResEng B. Mathias: And with friends, you can go explore the cavern together.
(03/02 04:13:19)  ResEng B. Mathias: Please feel free to go explore at any time.   Next topic is sight seeing.
(03/02 04:13:54)  ResEng B. Mathias: I tell all new comers to first fully explore their Relto's (the place you start).
(03/02 04:14:19)  ResEng B. Mathias: Its your private space and only you can go there unless you invite guests.
(03/02 04:14:44) JWPlatt quickly grabs Dalken's harmonica and links into oblivion!
(03/02 04:14:44)  ResEng B. Mathias: Its a dynamic place and will change over time based on items you discover in the cavern.
(03/02 04:15:18)  ResEng B. Mathias: Explore the cavern, the 'hoods, the city, the Books....new sights are around every corner.
(03/02 04:15:38)  ResEng B. Mathias: You'll find things everywhere...some modern, some ancient...don't be afraid to interact.
(03/02 04:16:13)  ResEng B. Mathias: Remember that the Ages of D'ni do not always work the way you think...you have to figure out what they were thinking.
(03/02 04:16:36) Dalken Starbyne deployed a decoy harmonica, unknown JWPlatt
(03/02 04:16:56)  ResEng B. Mathias: The DRC sill try to communicate to you via you KI, via their website (drcsite.org), or via personal interaction.
(03/02 04:17:21)  ResEng B. Mathias: there is a lot going on in this massive space...somethimes you just have tofind it.
(03/02 04:18:03)  ResEng B. Mathias: Next topic:  History of D'ni and The DRC....please follow me to fountain area if you want to continue.
(03/02 04:19:19)  ResEng B. Mathias: Hmmm the whole classromm might need to be rescue!!!!
(03/02 04:20:07)  ResEng B. Mathias: Alternate plan...I will give  history lesson here
(03/02 04:20:30)  BIG TUNA: What is the new age?
(03/02 04:20:40) Logs dumped to "stuckreseng"
(03/02 04:20:44) Dalken Starbyne waves goodbye
(03/02 04:21:21) ResEng B. Mathias redface, the ResEng continues
(03/02 04:22:00)  ResEng B. Mathias: Most everything you will see is the result of a civilization known as the D'ni.
(03/02 04:22:16)  Demelza: i'll go
(03/02 04:22:37)  ResEng B. Mathias: The D'ni lived in this cavern for nearly 10,000 years after arriving from another Age.
(03/02 04:22:42)  Demelza: slash "dance"
(03/02 04:23:21)  ResEng B. Mathias: About 200 years ago, a disgruntled citizen, using a lethal gas, tragically destroyed all his people and their history :(
(03/02 04:23:39)  ResEng B. Mathias: And we thought postal workers were bad.
(03/02 04:23:42)  ResEng B. Mathias: :)
(03/02 04:23:49)  Ja'run: where is the linking stone?
(03/02 04:24:14)  Ja'run: did it jump bevins or is it gone?
(03/02 04:24:36)  ResEng B. Mathias: Ever since the gassing, the cavern, the Ages, and the rest of  the D'ni creations have been practically empty save a few lonely explorers.
(03/02 04:24:44)  Tayrtahn: ah, so it is gone...
(03/02 04:25:19)  Tayrtahn: huzzah, I'm stuck too
(03/02 04:25:22)  Tayrtahn: logout time
(03/02 04:25:25)  Ja'run: by the eyes of Yeesha, where did it go?!
(03/02 04:25:51)  ResEng B. Mathias: The D'ni Restoration Council, the DRC, is generally considered "in charge".
(03/02 04:26:29) Ja'run checks his PA system
(03/02 04:26:37)  Ja'run: Does anyone know anything about the stone?
(03/02 04:26:48)  ResEng B. Mathias: The DRC was formed by Mr Elias Zandi in 1997 ten years after the modern day discovery of the cavern.
(03/02 04:27:02)  Ja'run: the Bahro stone
(03/02 04:27:15)  ResEng B. Mathias: Stone was turned off...it was turned on by accident.
(03/02 04:27:45)  Zin: ahh i see
(03/02 04:28:21)  ResEng B. Mathias: Mr Zandi contacted a number of specialists that he hope would aid in the Restoraton effort.
(03/02 04:28:32)  ResEng B. Mathias: Eventually there were 5 leaders.
(03/02 04:29:14)  mtn'man: greetings explorers
(03/02 04:29:14)  Nonphat: Hello
(03/02 04:29:30)  ResEng B. Mathias: Dr Watson led the Council and Dr. Marie Sutherland, Dr Ikuro Kodama, Victor Laxman and Michael Engbert were under him.
(03/02 04:30:06)  ResEng B. Mathias: Dr Watson left the Council in 2004 when the cavern's restoration was shut down due to lack of funding.
(03/02 04:30:37)  ResEng B. Mathias: In 2006, Cate Alexander, provided a new source of funding.  The DRC is happy to be back in business.
(03/02 04:31:27)  ResEng B. Mathias: Next topic  and last topic is Linking.  Please follow me to the Linking room if you want to continue.
(03/02 04:32:19)  En'duruin: k meet me in the lobby
(03/02 04:32:24)  En'duruin: by the fountain
(03/02 04:32:56) ResEng B. Mathias Takes a big swig from an hidden flask ( and guess what, it wasn't coffee)
(03/02 04:33:34) Wayneji starts to laugh
(03/02 04:33:34)  ResEng B. Mathias: If there is one word that sets apart the D'ni from all other civilizations, it is Linking.
(03/02 04:33:39) Irena laughs
(03/02 04:34:24)  ResEng B. Mathias: The D'ni called Linking "The Art" and The Art enabled them to connect to new Ages written in Books.
(03/02 04:35:06)  ResEng B. Mathias: The D'ni did not actually believe that they were creating those new Ages but instead were creating a Link to an already existing location.
(03/02 04:35:14) Waldorf bows
(03/02 04:36:03)  ResEng B. Mathias: As a result it was possible, in many instances, to uncover things that were not specifically written when the book was created, to find the unexpected.
(03/02 04:36:25)  ResEng B. Mathias: Linking was the pride of the D'ni and ironically, considered by some, their downfall.
(03/02 04:36:42) En'duruin bows
(03/02 04:36:50)  ResEng B. Mathias: Thanks for listening...You may now start asking questions.
(03/02 04:36:51) ResEng B. Mathias bows
(03/02 04:37:10)  Shoemaker: Mr. Mathias -- can you take OOC questions, even one?
(03/02 04:37:12) Wayneji cheers
(03/02 04:37:39)  ResEng B. Mathias: depends if I can get a laugh with my answer.
(03/02 04:37:56) Kultheran waves hello
(03/02 04:38:00)  Shoemaker: No, but you may encourage people here.  Is Tim Larkin still associated with the URU project?
(03/02 04:38:02) ResEng B. Mathias waves hello
(03/02 04:38:39)  ResEng B. Mathias: I'm sorry, I don't know
(03/02 04:38:40)  Kultheran: Nice helmet, Mathias!
(03/02 04:38:47)  ResEng B. Mathias: thank you.

(04/20 02:18:05)  ResEng G.Buddell: I can tell you a couple of things about it.
(04/20 02:18:22)  ResEng G.Buddell: It's called Tetsonot, and it was placed in the City Museum this afternoon.
(04/20 02:18:48) Kimmie cheers
(04/20 02:19:28)  ResEng G.Buddell: Beyond that, we like to let explorers find out about the Ages on their own.
(04/20 02:19:50)  Kimmie: thats good news  ResEng Buddell :)
(04/20 02:21:40)  Irena: It seems a little empty tonight. Not as many new explorers today?
(04/20 02:22:00)  ResEng G.Buddell: Nope.  My guess would be everyone's hanging out in Tetsonot.
(04/20 02:22:15)  ResEng G.Buddell: Or running marker missions... it's been kind of quiet since the 13th.
(04/20 02:22:22)  Kimmie: GoG was busy earlier....

(09/23 20:45:14) Kreel says hey
(09/23 20:45:32)  Kreel: Oh my gosh...its really you
(09/23 20:45:49)  Irena: in the flesh...:) for a change
(09/23 20:46:03)  Irena: how've you been?
(09/23 20:46:19)  Kreel: Very very busy with surface matters.  Work, mostly
(09/23 20:46:32)  Irena: yeah - have known that feeling!
(09/23 20:46:37)  Kreel: Since I saw you last, I've probably covered about 50,000 miles 
(09/23 20:47:06)  Irena: Wow - I've been mostly staying here, just lots of projects.
(09/23 20:47:24)  Kreel: My work requires a lot of travel.
(09/23 20:47:53)  Irena: Ah - is that good, bad, both, neither?
(09/23 20:48:37)  Kreel: mostly good.  I get to a lot of places and meet some really cool people!
(09/23 20:49:03)  Irena: Good. :)  Work is much harder when it sucks too...
(09/23 20:49:35)  Kreel: I love what I do...but sometimes I get physically worn out from the travel.
(09/23 20:49:57)  Kreel: And it takes a toll on my family sometimes, which I don't like
(09/23 20:50:41)  Irena: Do you know much of what is happeYeah, that is a serious down-side. I am glad you love what you do!
(09/23 20:51:20)  Irena: OOPS - two thoughts in one message...the first part was going to be - Have you kept up with cavern events?
(09/23 20:51:25)  Kreel: As or what's been happening here, I don't know a lot.  I've heard Kiril talk about some kind of Bahro war oing on
(09/23 20:52:00)  Kreel: And apparently someone was killed by a Bahro...I'd call that worrisome
(09/23 20:52:48)  Irena: I have followed some of the surface forums and have heard about the war and our shaky place in it. Wheeling Engberg was killed by a Bahro and a friend of hers was killed in a cave-in. They had gone someplace not-so-safe in the city.
(09/23 20:53:22)  Irena: It is troubling. Particularly that Wheely was alive until the rescue team was just about to get to her. I heard it was pretty aweful for them. :(
(09/23 20:53:32)  Kreel: I didn't know about the cave-in.  Yikes...worse than I thought.  I'va also heard that some guy named Phil is back...some have said they've been to is Relto
(09/23 20:54:39)  Irena: That's about as much as I've heard as well. Don't know anythong about this Phil. I've heard there's a way from Teledahn to his Relto, but haven't tried to find it yet.
(09/23 20:55:37)  Kreel: Neither have I.  The few times I've been here, I've only stayed long enough to get to Ae'Gura and try and catch up on recent events.  I've also seen a new age book show up in a place called the Watcher's Pub
(09/23 20:55:54)  Irena: The deaths have caused a shake-up in the DRC. Micheal Engberg left for a while. He's back, but not sure if he's back with the DRC. Sharper is off doing something related to Bahro again. Not sure about what though...
(09/23 20:56:25)  Kreel: Yeah, I heard some rumors about that, and some guy named Watson is around, too
(09/23 20:57:05)  Irena: I've been to the new place from the Watcher's Pub. It's oddly beautiful with lots of weird machinery. Seems we can feed the lake with it, and make the lake algea grow brighter.
(09/23 20:57:30)  Kreel: Wow...I didn't know that part.  
(09/23 20:57:34)  Irena: Ah, I'd heard the one about Watson too. Wasn't sure that one was true - he's been gone a long time!
(09/23 20:58:49)  Kreel: What time is it where you are?
(09/23 20:59:08)  Irena: I had some time a while back and managed to get the machinery on in the new age. It's a very convoluted system, hope those algea like the food...it sure is hard to make!
(09/23 20:59:37)  Irena: It's 4pm - what time is it where you are?
(09/23 21:00:14)  Kreel: You're on central, then.  I'm on EDT and its 5pm.  And in about 15 minutes, I have to make somedinner for guests coming ove tonight1
(09/23 21:00:32)  Irena: oh - sorry I was so late then...:(
(09/23 21:01:13)  Irena: I had a early afternoon project that took a lot longer than I had expected. What times work for you in the coming week? I have some flexibility...:)
(09/23 21:01:28)  Kreel: Well, can't be helped.  I got in here about 3pm my time and waited for you to show up.  Someone named White Rose, had a death in her family and several are holding vigil for her in the Uru Obsession Bevin, so I was over there for a while
(09/23 21:01:56)  Irena: Ouch, sorry to hear about that.
(09/23 21:02:16)  Kreel: Next week is not good...heading to Texas until Thursday night.  But I'll be around next weekend.
(09/23 21:02:22)  Kreel: And the week after
(09/23 21:02:33)  Kreel: Are you ever available during the daytime?
(09/23 21:03:44)  Irena: Crossing schedules again...:(... I am out of town next saturday until the 9th or 10th of October....sigh...Pout.
(09/23 21:04:29)  Kreel: Wow...the gates are against us ever exploring this place together!!
(09/23 21:04:44)  Irena: Daytimes I am at work - although from the 10th of Oct through the 21st i am on vacation, so should have most of those days available!
(09/23 21:04:44) Kreel sighs
(09/23 21:05:26)  Kreel: I'll be around a lot during that time, though not the entire time.  Maybe we can steal a few afternoons for a couple of hours of exploing"
(09/23 21:05:29)  Kreel: exloring
(09/23 21:05:37)  Kreel: Exploring, I mean..geesh
(09/23 21:06:02)  Irena: That would be Wicked Cool!! I do sometimes get frustrated at how the surface so often intrudes into my life...:)
(09/23 21:06:16) Kreel starts to laugh
(09/23 21:06:25)  Kreel: I know....
(09/23 21:06:42) Irena laughs
(09/23 21:07:11)  Kreel: Have you found anything new for your Relto?
(09/23 21:07:50)  Irena: I found the fungus plants in the algea feeding age - those are kind of fun, and fortunately, I don't seem alergic to those spores!
(09/23 21:08:16)  Irena: Oh, and a bird followed me home from the desert near Zandi the other night.
(09/23 21:08:18)  Kreel: Cool.  Yes, I recall how you sneezed in Teledahn
(09/23 21:08:40)  Kreel: Oh a pet bird..how nice!
(09/23 21:09:03)  Irena: Yup! How about you?
(09/23 21:09:58)  Kreel: Not really.  I just haven't had any time to do any exploring.  I've heard there's new linking books in the library and in the museum, too.  Lots for us to do, I think.
(09/23 21:10:30)  Irena: Sounds like it! I had almost given up on the Library - nothing ever seemed to be there.
(09/23 21:10:58)  Kreel: Well, apparently there is now.  So, we have that to look forward too as well. 
(09/23 21:11:35)  Irena: Very cool! Did anyone have any juicy rumors about what the DRC is working on at the moment?
(09/23 21:12:18)  Kreel: I've heard that they are about to open another linking age to some place called ayonnie or ahonanny or something like that.
(09/23 21:13:04)  Kreel: Kiril still keeps his journals, so I might try to steal a glance when I can.
(09/23 21:14:21)  Irena: Annoyingny? At least I've seen that pencilled on a pice of paper Shandi forgot to pick up...sadly, that was about all there was on the paper, other than a few things that helped me with the algea feeding place.
(09/23 21:16:16)  Kreel: Well, that's good.  I need to run now.  
(09/23 21:16:57)  Irena: I'll poke around at Shandi's stuff again and see if I can find anything else. Should I send it to your KI if I do? Or is there a different way you'd like me to send it?
(09/23 21:17:25)  Kreel: Ki is great.  I'll do the same if I hear anything.
(09/23 21:17:47)  Irena: Wicked! Have a great night and enjoy your dinner!
(09/23 21:17:56)  Kreel: See you soon...
(09/23 21:17:59) Kreel waves goodbye
(09/23 21:18:11)  Irena: what is the bye wave? i forgot...:(
(09/23 21:18:23)  Kreel: it is "/wavebye"
(09/23 21:18:33)  Irena: wicked!

/* message for Kreel */
I found a bit more in Shandi's stuff. Here's the rest of the notes on that new age:

The DRC site shows Annoyingny approachinbg completion. I hope it isn't as annoying as the version Cyan created for their Uru Complete Chronicles release. All that running around, back and forth, back and forth, and then dropping pellets and waiting. Worse than feeding the lake because you have to stand around and wait for the few seconds of glow from the pellet. Oh well, time will tell...

They were pretty close with Er'Cana, although the Cyan "recipe" for pellets was faster and not as optimal as what others have discovered now.

I was going to ask Shandi about her notes last night, but she was terribly distracted. Her company is working on an MMO for release in a few months. I was only half listening, until she mentioned one of their chief designers, Sophia Nelson, has gone missing. Sophia has been coming in to the bar where I work and we had been talking a lot on the slower nights. Turns out I might have been the last one to see her four nights ago.

If I seem a bit distracted, that might be why. I already asked Shandi if she had given Sophia a linking book in case she was just involved in exploration. She said she had tried but Sophia hadn't been interested.

(10/19 03:31:52) To Kreel: Yes, it has. sigh...
(10/19 03:32:13) From Kreel: what's been going on?
(10/19 03:33:07)  Irena: hmm, been busy on the surface. Still looking for the missing programmer, and still no leads...
(10/19 03:33:37) From Kreel: Wow...what a bummer that must be!
(10/19 03:34:23)  Irena: It's been weird. Almost as scary weird as the Bahro conflit rumors that have been going around.
(10/19 03:35:10)  Kreel: Yes, there's been all sorts of stories I've picked up on about Bahro and a killing and who knows what...something's up!!
(10/19 03:35:23)  Irena: It's got Shandi pretty freaked. She has to pick up the missing stuff at her job and she's trying to rope me in to help, since I am familiar with the source of their ie\deas as well. It's kind of a long story...:)
(10/19 03:36:09)  Irena: Yes, the Bahro stuff is truly scary! Two dead, wars raging, and the possibility we will be "in the middle"
(10/19 03:36:13)  Kreel: Kiril said shandi had been pretty busy lately
(10/19 03:36:33)  Kreel: Two dead?  Wow, I only heard about one...
(10/19 03:36:44) Kreel looks around nervously
(10/19 03:36:48) Kreel looks around for a bit
(10/19 03:37:19)  Irena: One directly attributed to the Bahro, the other from a cave in, but I sort of wonder if the cave in had anything to do with the Bahro...
(10/19 03:37:44)  Kreel: Hmmm...it wouldn't surprise me.
(10/19 03:37:45)  Irena: The crack the two were exploring did appear rather suddenly, and after some type of seismic shock.
(10/19 03:38:21)  Kreel: Do you think all the linking in and out creates some sort of energy wave that has a long term effect?
(10/19 03:38:37)  Kreel: Something not easily detected, i mean
(10/19 03:38:50)  Irena: The Bahro thing does make it feel less home-like here and more like a strange and possibly dangerous area.
(10/19 03:39:34)  Kreel: Well, we could link somewhere else.  Have you explored anything since we were last in that Mushroom world...Teledalhn
(10/19 03:39:36)  Irena: I hadn't thought about the energy of linking, but there might be something to that. There is a lot more linking activity with all the new explorers coming in.
(10/19 03:40:09)  Kreel: Its just an untested hypothesis of mine...
(10/19 03:40:34)  Kreel: But it might explain the state of decay down here.
(10/19 03:40:50)  Irena: I have been to Er'cana, the place for making lake feeding pellets, and I went to four pod ages. The DRC was talking them up a while ago. That's about it, other than gathering books for my shelf when I hear of them.
(10/19 03:40:51)  Kreel: I mean there's no natural erosion here, right?  No wind, no rain.
(10/19 03:41:01)  Irena: Haven't used them though...
(10/19 03:41:21)  Kreel: Well, you're ahead of me, then.
(10/19 03:41:33)  Kreel: Shall we visit somewhere for a little while?
(10/19 03:41:52)  Irena: Right. And the only place I've seen water dripping from the ceiling is near the Great Zero - and that's more like a steady flow in a small area.
(10/19 03:42:11)  Irena: Sure! Any ideas where you'd like to go?
(10/19 03:42:30)  Kreel: Your choice.  Where do you want to start?
(10/19 03:43:28)  Irena: Wow, uh so many choices...do you know if the first four ages should be visited before any of the newer places?
(10/19 03:44:14)  Kreel: Well...I'm not sure.  But there does seem to be some connection between those ages and then the others 
(10/19 03:44:25)  Kreel: Those pillars in our Relto, for example
(10/19 03:45:08)  Irena: I should have looked, we finished Teledahn, didn't we? I heard someone say there's a different Relto we can visit from there though.
(10/19 03:45:18)  Kreel: Of course, "newer" is a relative term here.  They're new to us...but, that's only because the linking books have only been recently discovered
(10/19 03:45:33)  Kreel: I'm not sure there's a right order to explore in.
(10/19 03:45:35)  Irena: Want to take a look for that, then maybe some place like the fortress world, what is it called again, Gahresen or something like that...
(10/19 03:46:06)  Kreel: From Teledahn?...Hmmm...interesting.  Okay we can try that
(10/19 03:46:14)  Kreel: Your place?
(10/19 03:47:20)  Kreel: Wow...where did you get all these plants?
(10/19 03:47:31)  Kreel: and what is that?
(10/19 03:47:34) Kreel points
(10/19 03:47:48) Irena blushes
(10/19 03:47:54) Kreel is jealous..
(10/19 03:48:37)  Kreel: Hmmm...more floating stones.  Very odd, don't you think?
(10/19 03:48:41)  Kreel: I mean what is it?
(10/19 03:49:01)  Irena: Oh right, I forgot a few places...the Viewer thing came from the Great Zero and the Mushroom plants from Er'cana. The trees came from one of the garden ages, i think it was Eder Delin, someone invited me to it.
(10/19 03:49:29)  Kreel: Very pretty...very pretty indeed.
(10/19 03:49:47)  Irena: Yes, the floating stones seem to come from strange portals. The 4 pod ages each had a portal that appeared if you waited in the pods long enough.
(10/19 03:49:57)  Kreel: And you have more sparklie things than me, too
(10/19 03:50:03)  Irena: The top half came after finding more Journey Cloths in Er'Cana.
(10/19 03:50:06)  Kreel: Clearly I have some catching up to do!!
(10/19 03:50:23)  Kreel: Well, shall we try to find that other Relto?
(10/19 03:51:00)  Irena: For the sparklies, I'm embarrassed to say i just hung around and listened until I heard them mentioned, then kind of followed along to see them...
(10/19 03:51:32)  Irena: Ok, guess we should start at the beginning of Teledahn. I'll set the pages...
(10/19 03:52:21)  Kreel: OOC for a sec...if I get CTD'd or something, I'll come right back
(10/19 03:52:24)  Irena: Teledahn is set to the linking image. Want to go first?
(10/19 03:54:20)  Kreel: Wow...I forgot how pretty it is here
(10/19 03:54:41)  Irena: True. I don't come to some of these ages nearly enough...
(10/19 03:54:54)  Kreel: Where do we start?
(10/19 03:55:14) Kreel sneezes
(10/19 03:55:29)  Irena: I'm not entirely sure. We are looking for a linking book in a nitch somewhere, i think...
(10/19 03:55:35) Error: Don't know how to '/sneez'
(10/19 03:55:41) Irena sneezes
(10/19 03:55:58)  Kreel: A nitch or a niche?
(10/19 03:56:02)  Irena: Oh, right, now I remember why I don't come here as often...
(10/19 03:56:02) Kreel starts to laugh
(10/19 03:56:26)  Irena: Nitch, i think i heard.
(10/19 03:56:33) Irena sneezes
(10/19 03:57:04) Kreel forgot the allergy pills again
(10/19 03:57:14) Irena nods
(10/19 03:57:20)  Irena: yeah, me too
(10/19 03:57:22) Irena sighs
(10/19 03:57:38)  Kreel: Well, let's think for a moment.  
(10/19 03:57:42)  Irena: I was going to take a check here before moving on.
(10/19 03:57:52) Irena sneezes
(10/19 03:57:54)  Kreel: Would the nitch be more likely to be insdie or out?
(10/19 03:58:01)  Irena: Thinking is good! :)
(10/19 03:58:44)  Irena: Good question. And would it be more likely in the flesh of the shrooms or in some of the rocky bits.
(10/19 03:58:56) Irena sneezes
(10/19 03:59:24)  Kreel: Well, if you wanted it to be secure, I'm not sure the shrooms would be.
(10/19 03:59:39)  Kreel: They could die, or erode, or get broken
(10/19 04:00:06)  Kreel: But the caves...now they would be strong
(10/19 04:00:20)  Irena: Right, for security, the rock would make more sense. There are already semi-secure cells...
(10/19 04:00:45)  Irena: Maybe we should start there instead.
(10/19 04:00:53)  Kreel: And, wasn't there some sort of hidden nitch in one of them we found before?
(10/19 04:01:12)  Irena: We could go around and work our way back, or go through the cage...thoughts?
(10/19 04:01:19) Irena says DOH!
(10/19 04:01:21)  Kreel: I remember we found a secert stair or something after we got up that ladder
(10/19 04:01:41)  Kreel: Doh?
(10/19 04:01:50)  Kreel: you remember something/
(10/19 04:02:10)  Irena: You're right! And there was the weird empty shelf nitch in the cell area, the one that opened up when we closed the cell door, and closed when we opened it.
(10/19 04:02:34) Irena sneezes
(10/19 04:02:36)  Kreel: Oh yeah.  I remember we saw that.  But it was empty, as I recall.
(10/19 04:02:45)  Kreel: Bless you
(10/19 04:03:01)  Kreel: Can we get back there from here?
(10/19 04:03:17) Kreel sneezes
(10/19 04:03:20)  Irena: True, it was. But it was one of the more secure areas.
(10/19 04:03:51)  Irena: I think we can - remember the broken walk-way? I remember jumping on it and it falling down to provide us a path...
(10/19 04:03:54)  Kreel: Well, let's look for thatt again.  Good place to start anyway
(10/19 04:04:13)  Irena: Also, there were fewer spores there!
(10/19 04:04:16) Irena sneezes
(10/19 04:05:08)  Kreel: wow, rhat macnine is still on!
(10/19 04:05:45)  Irena: Huh! Could have sworn I had that walkway down...
(10/19 04:06:25)  Kreel: Nope..that is definitely NOT down!
(10/19 04:06:38)  Irena: Guess we go back through the cells instead.
(10/19 04:06:59)  Kreel: Can't we use a journey cloth?
(10/19 04:07:10)  Irena: Maybe it was Shan saying she had jumped hers down...does stress make your memory go weird? Cuz mine sure seems whacked of late...
(10/19 04:07:26)  Irena: We could do that - might be faster...
(10/19 04:10:00)  Kreel: can't remember where we go...
(10/19 04:10:20)  Irena: Through the far door, i think...
(10/19 04:11:25)  Kreel: I think this is the path back
(10/19 04:12:11)  Irena: Too much coffee today? You seem a bit jumpy...
(10/19 04:12:26)  Kreel: I htink its the storms
(10/19 04:13:31)  Kreel: Was this the place?
(10/19 04:13:52) Kreel eamines the wall
(10/19 04:14:03)  Irena: Looks like it. I can just see an outline on  the wall. I can go through and flip a switch, see if it opens again..
(10/19 04:14:13)  Kreel: okay...
(10/19 04:14:35)  Kreel: Yes, that opened it
(10/19 04:14:45)  Kreel: And there's a bahro stone here
(10/19 04:14:47)  Irena: Do I see something in it?
(10/19 04:14:57)  Kreel: uh oh
(10/19 04:15:15) Kreel hands you your ration of bread and water
(10/19 04:15:33)  Irena: MMM, Bread...but no beer???
(10/19 04:15:44)  Kreel: Hey, this is prison lady!!
(10/19 04:15:47) Kreel starts to laugh
(10/19 04:16:09)  Irena: But i signed up for the country-club prison - what went wrong?
(10/19 04:16:23)  Kreel: You fell for that???
(10/19 04:16:28) Irena says DOH!
(10/19 04:16:34) Irena laughs
(10/19 04:16:58)  Irena: Glad I have a linking book. nya-nya-nya...:)
(10/19 04:17:01)  Kreel: Well, I think the solution here is for you to link back to your relto then back where we justwere
(10/19 04:19:05)  Kreel: Do we have to share it to end up in the same place?
(10/19 04:20:07)  Kreel: Hmm... I see it, but when I touch it, it disappears
(10/19 04:20:42)  Irena: Hmm, now i can't give it to you, or release it either...
(10/19 04:21:04)  Kreel: Hmm...
(10/19 04:21:16)  Kreel: can't you just clikc off it
(10/19 04:21:44)  Kreel: And I can't move...aren't we a pair!
(10/19 04:21:59)  Irena: Ok, who put super-glue on the Bahro stone? it's not funny....
(10/19 04:22:00) Kreel does a dance
(10/19 04:22:15) Irena does a dance
(10/19 04:22:27)  Kreel: Hmmm.. I can dance, but not walk or jump
(10/19 04:22:33)  Kreel: or even turn
(10/19 04:22:42)  Kreel: I'm stuck
(10/19 04:22:44)  Irena: and i didn't see you dance...
(10/19 04:22:51)  Kreel: stuck I say
(10/19 04:22:57)  Kreel: You didn't see me dance?
(10/19 04:23:01)  Kreel: you're kdding
(10/19 04:23:16)  Kreel: I saw you...great moves by the way
(10/19 04:23:53)  Kreel: Let me try giving you my Relto book and see if we link out of this mess
(10/19 04:24:04) Error: Don't know how to '/blushes deeply'
(10/19 04:24:06) Irena bows
(10/19 04:24:16)  Irena: thank you for the compliment!
(10/19 04:24:25)  Kreel: You need to come closer to me, since I can't move
(10/19 04:24:29)  Irena: ok - can you open yours?
(10/19 04:24:33)  Kreel: ye
(10/19 04:24:35)  Kreel: yes
(10/19 04:25:04)  Kreel: Nope, won't let me do that.
(10/19 04:25:09)  Kreel: Can you give me yours?
(10/19 04:25:24)  Irena: let me try. opening and closing mine didn't release the tablet, but...
(10/19 04:25:57)  Kreel: very odd
(10/19 04:26:06)  Kreel: I clicked on it,
(10/19 04:26:26)  Kreel: I see it, and click on it
(10/19 04:26:28)  Kreel: nothing
(10/19 04:27:10)  Irena: ok, now this is getting a bit scary...however, i seem to have finally dropped the tablet.
(10/19 04:27:10)  Kreel: And I can't even give you mine.
(10/19 04:27:19)  Kreel: Can you use your Relto book?
(10/19 04:27:31)  Irena: Let me see... back soon if i can.
(10/19 04:28:01) From Kreel in Irena's Teledahn: If your back in Relto...go to our hood and I'll meet you there
(10/19 04:28:22) To Kreel: ok - will wait for you there.
(10/19 04:29:44)  Kreel: Shall we try that again?
(10/19 04:29:53)  Irena: Welcome back! Shall we try that again? Maybe straight linking instead of sharing?
(10/19 04:29:59)  Kreel: okay
(10/19 04:30:11) Logs dumped to "SpyHoleShareFail"
(10/19 04:31:14)  Irena: I'm definitely sending a note to the DRC about that one!
(10/19 04:31:25)  Kreel: ME TOO!!!!
(10/19 04:32:42)  Kreel: After you..
(10/19 04:34:28)  Kreel: Man, I'm laggy tonight
(10/19 04:34:33) Kreel takes a swig
(10/19 04:34:48)  Kreel: shall I?
(10/19 04:35:02)  Irena: Sure - let's see what happenes
(10/19 04:35:32)  Irena: YES!!!
(10/19 04:35:34) Irena does a dance
(10/19 04:35:35)  Kreel: Wow...hope no one else shows up!
(10/19 04:35:45) Kreel does a dance
(10/19 04:36:01)  Irena: It would get really crowded in her in a hurry.
(10/19 04:36:10)  Kreel: What do you see
(10/19 04:36:34)  Irena: Looks like someone's office, but i can't make out what's on the whiteboard...
(10/19 04:37:08)  Irena: Any luck?
(10/19 04:37:18)  Kreel: looks like a map of some sort.  A map of D'Ni perhaps?
(10/19 04:37:33)  Irena: Maybe. A DRC office then?
(10/19 04:37:37)  Kreel: Man, this place is no bigger than a phone booth
(10/19 04:37:45)  Kreel: Sure looked like it
(10/19 04:37:59)  Irena: Ah, brings back memories - how many gamers can you stuff in a phone booth?
(10/19 04:37:59)  Kreel (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):  
(10/19 04:38:01) Irena laughs
(10/19 04:38:01)  
(10/19 04:38:25) Kreel starts to laugh
(10/19 04:38:39)  Kreel: There is a seat here
(10/19 04:38:45)  Irena: And a linking book
(10/19 04:38:48)  Kreel: But can't sit down for some reason
(10/19 04:39:05)  Kreel: Hmmm...looks like I've got you cornered now!!
(10/19 04:39:13)  Irena: Strange. Weird place for a chair, unless someone was spying...
(10/19 04:39:31)  Irena: oh no...
(10/19 04:39:33) Irena laughs
(10/19 04:39:33)  Kreel: That's got to be it...someone is spying on that office...but WHY?
(10/19 04:39:56) Kreel is a bit puzzled...
(10/19 04:40:14)  Kreel: who'd want to spy on that office?  Who's office is it?
(10/19 04:40:21)  Irena: I don't know. Maybe the DRC meetings were happening there. Or ssome type of high level discussions.
(10/19 04:40:33)  Kreel: We wonders, yes we wonder precious
(10/19 04:40:53)  Irena: gollum, preciousssss
(10/19 04:41:03)  Kreel: Well, for discussions you'd want a listening device...this spy wanted to SEE something
(10/19 04:41:27)  Kreel: Take another look...do you see anything important?
(10/19 04:41:32)  Irena: true, unless you could either read lips, or couldn't get access to plant a device.
(10/19 04:42:06)  Kreel: Unless.....
(10/19 04:42:18) Kreel is thinking
(10/19 04:42:39)  Kreel: What if the spy was the same person whose office that is?
(10/19 04:42:42)  Irena: hmm - the board looks like a copy of the map on display in the city. But the book on the table might be a linking book. it looks like there's a panel...
(10/19 04:43:06)  Irena: ah, not that could be - see who's doing what when you aren't around...
(10/19 04:43:12)  Kreel: Maybe he or she wanted to see if someone else was stealing into their office?
(10/19 04:43:33)  Kreel: Maybe they suspected someone of stealing something?
(10/19 04:43:45)  Kreel: Or perhaps the BAhro were looking for something?
(10/19 04:44:07)  Irena: Wonder what's in the crates. Or if they had as yet unreleased linking books that someone was slipping out with...
(10/19 04:44:44)  Kreel: Ah..I'll bet that's it.  I'll bet that office is wherre newly discovered linking books were brought...and someone found out
(10/19 04:44:55)  Kreel: And took one...unauthorized by the DRC
(10/19 04:45:16)  Irena: That would certainly wind them up! and prompt this kind of arrangement.
(10/19 04:45:23)  Kreel: You don't think....no couldn't be
(10/19 04:45:29)  Irena: Wonder where this book goes...
(10/19 04:45:36)  Irena: think what?
(10/19 04:46:01)  Kreel: Well....mind you this is wild guess...but what if the body in the cave were also the theif?
(10/19 04:46:14)  Kreel: And the cave in no accident
(10/19 04:47:15)  Irena: But the two killed in the cave in were only teenagers according to the reports. One was Wheely Engberg, Michael Engberg's daughter. and the other her friend.
(10/19 04:47:53)  Kreel: Hmmm....well, perhaps I'm overthinking.
(10/19 04:48:00)  Kreel: Meanwhile, here's a book
(10/19 04:48:01)  Irena: Although, they would have access to DRC places...ewe, not sure I like the thought of that kind of reaction on the DRC's part...
(10/19 04:48:04) Kreel points
(10/19 04:48:30)  Irena: The panel looks like a Relto. Shall we find out?
(10/19 04:48:36)  Kreel: go for it..
(10/19 04:49:22) To Kreel: Oh! Look, a sparklie!!
(10/19 04:49:24)  Kreel: Ooohhhh a sparklie
(10/19 04:49:45)  spacehead: Wow I thought I was alone
(10/19 04:50:00)  Suedera: where are we?
(10/19 04:50:14)  Kreel: Why your right here...
(10/19 04:50:39)  Irena: In somebody's Relto, uninvited...strange...
(10/19 04:50:40)  Kreel: My Ki says this is Phil's Relto.  Who the H*** is Phil?
(10/19 04:50:52)  Suedera: did you guys solve the panel puzzle?
(10/19 04:50:53) Murray waves hello
(10/19 04:51:01) Irena waves hello
(10/19 04:51:01)  
(10/19 04:51:04)  Kreel: Panel puzzle?
(10/19 04:51:08) Sophia waves hello
(10/19 04:51:22)  Sophia: I would like you to meet my hubby Murray :)
(10/19 04:51:23)  Suedera: yeah, with the gold panels and switches?
(10/19 04:51:24)  Irena: We found a Bahro stone in Teledahn, is that what you mean?
(10/19 04:51:32) Murray waves hello
(10/19 04:51:33)  Suedera: yeah
(10/19 04:51:54)  Kreel: Yes, that's how we finally got here.  Irena and I were exploring together
(10/19 04:52:08)  Suedera: so everyone used 2 people to get here?
(10/19 04:52:14)  Irena: Phil - wasn't he one of the early explorers?
(10/19 04:52:15)  spacehead: Not me
(10/19 04:52:18)  Kreel: Interesting that everyone seems to be able to get here so easily...why this Relto I wonder
(10/19 04:52:36)  Irena: Yeah, I wonder as well...
(10/19 04:52:41)  spacehead: It had to do with old story line
(10/19 04:52:43)  Suedera: whats the solution to the puzzle then? its had us stumped for hours now...
(10/19 04:52:59)  spacehead: Which puzzel?
(10/19 04:53:02)  Kreel: You must have solved it, because your here
(10/19 04:53:32)  Suedera: i think we cheated, he messed up the order so the door would open so i could go through and get here
(10/19 04:53:39) Kreel wishes he had his umbrella
(10/19 04:54:06)  spacehead: that isn't realy cheeting
(10/19 04:54:07)  Irena: Kreel, check this out - no sparklie island here.
(10/19 04:54:17)  Kreel: yes, i see that...wonder why?
(10/19 04:54:37)  Kreel: Hey, Irena, come see all these books
(10/19 04:54:46)  Irena: I see. WOW
(10/19 04:54:47)  Suedera (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):  
(10/19 04:54:47)  DunnyDave (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):

/* Notes for Kreel - about Surface Matters */

About the Surface stuff
Shandi, Sophia, Jaime, and I all met at university. We were such total geeks and really into the fantasy role playing thing. Jaime created a very elaborate "multi-verse", full of exotic characters, dangerous power plays, and a story arc spanning centuries of rising and falling civilizations. The rest of us were the players in these realms.

After university Jaime went off with some start up company that has since become a large supplier of networking systems. Shandi bounced around and ended up at a game development company and Sophia found her way there. They started creating an MMORG based on Jaime's original concepts. When they contacted her for the rights to use her ideas she arranged for her company to fund the project. There were some conditions and requirements, but I don't really know too many details at the moment.

The reason I am telling you all this is because of what I found at Sophia's.

About the Surface Stuff 2
(not sure what the limit on KI mail is - thus the break)

One of my skills is locks. I let myself in to Sophia's after her disappearance and copied off data for Shandi. I found the crystal I mentioned at the same time. What is so odd is the crystal behaves exactly like a fictional crystal from Jaime's game. It sends out a high intensity "calling" signal to a very powerful artifact. An artifact that travels through space, time, and dimensions. If you are geeky enough to remember Dr. Who, it is like a TARDIS on steroids.

Since the Cyan games were founded on something real, Shandi and I are wondering if Sophia's disappearance is similar to the fiction of Jaime's game. The premise for the online MMORG was: select random individuals from around the multi-verse, give them a cloned copy of the master Hut (the TARDIS like artifact), and ask them to help maintain balance in the multi-verse.

In game terms - throw them into various situations and see how they cope.

If there is any reality, it would mean Sophia has been selected and we may never know where she is or what happened. If it isn't real, then we are left with a strange hoax and an incredible special effect in the guise of the crystal.
