<p class="pagecaption">Chapter 6</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She faded into a round chamber with a strange pillar shaped device directly across the center of the room from her. It reached floor to ceiling and connected with a spinning toothed ring that made up a band just above the floor. Low mechanical rumbling accompanied the spinning gears. She turned, searching for a door. There was no door, only two unadorned pillars with the same spinning gear as the strange device.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her hand reached for her book and she faded back to her cloud island without a conscious thought. The open airiness did wonders for her nerves. Outside her hut she walked to an edge of her island, sat, and tried to make sense of what she had seen. Her sister's instructions about numbers slowly came back to her. She raised the strange KI on her wrist, stared at the various buttons and items on it, then remembered the purple book she had seen in the neighborhood. She rose and hurried back inside to teleport back to where the classroom was.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She ran through the empty sections and to the classroom. Grabbing the notebook, she scanned through it until she found the section on adding buddies using KI numbers. She fished the scrap of paper with the various numbers from her pocket and stared at it for a few minutes. The first number registered as Shandi, the second as her sister Katya, and the third as Katya's roommate Tatyana. With each entry the name returned an offline message. She hesitated before entering the last number. When she did, the name Kreel appeared with a note of "Shandi's Bevin" next to his name.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Not sure what to expect next, she waited in the classroom. When nothing happened she scanned the notes again and realized she needed to send the first message. She started several times before deciding on, "Hi, I'm Irena and my sister Katyarina said I should talk to you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few seconds later a message appeared on her KI, "Hi! I'm Kreel, Shandi and Katya said you might be coming down tonight. Where are you now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure? In a classroom somewhere, looking at a KI manual."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm going to send you an invite to Shandi' Bevin, that's Shandi's Neighborhood. That way we can talk face to face without having to type everything. Sound ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, uh, where will it show up and how do I use it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It will appear in your KI screen. To use it, go to the Nexus. It should be pretty clear, however, you might want to read the section on the Nexus in the KI manual. You remember the room you went to to link to where you got your KI? On the pedestal in the center of that room is the linking book for the nexus." Within moments the invitation arrived. She followed the instructions back to the circular room with the strange device. The mechanical sounds increased once she had selected the invite from Kreel. After several moments a book slide out and flopped open. She touched it and faded out of the Nexus.</p>
