<p class="pagecaption">Shandi's Diary</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">26 Sept 92</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dear Diary - ok, scratch that, it's too corny. I'm writing this because my shrink recommended it. It's supposed to help me deal with the death of my parents and all the changes that caused. I don't understand that. They died, nothing will bring them back. I cry for them almost every night. Maybe it would have been just a bit better if I had friends to help with the grief. It certainly would have been better if I had died with them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So here I am at university, same old boring me, same old lack of friends, and dead parents. How do the popular people do it? And I've got this totally sports obsessed roomie, up at 5, out running, every morning. And she can't get up with the first four times the alarm goes off! I've got to get a new life, and a new roomie.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">12 Oct 92</p>

<p class="regtxt5">New roomie. At least this one doesn't wake me up every morning, but she's kind of a zero like me. Hangs out with a bunch of fantasy role player geeks. I don't know what to write in this thing. I go to class, go work at the library, shelving books, and study. Why can't I be less boring?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And it still hurts. After two months of appointments and countless talks, it still hurts! When does it get better?</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">14 Nov 92</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Francine has been regaling me with tales of her gaming adventures all morning. I should be more bored, but I can almost see the attraction. It's a way to vicariously experience excitement, and it sounds like the creator of the scenarios is good with characters. Fran says every main non-player character created is very different.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">21 Nov 92</p>

<p class="regtxt5">More game stories. I'm more than mildly envious. Fran was talking about a new character the creator, "game master", introduced, a crazy woman named Shandi. Sounds like she is really wild, very insane, but also fearless and dynamic and doesn't take crap from anyone. I wish I could be like that. Every time someone says anything even a bit harsh, I'm in the corner in tears.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">10 Jan 93</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Okay....maybe writing in here will give me the courage to step away from myself. Mommy, Daddy, please don't be mad, but I can't keep on being that perfect little shy girl you raised. If I don't change I don't think I'll make it much longer. So lonely and so scared. Don't worry, it'd be pills, so there would be less mess. I know it's wrong, but it's either change or die. I'm going crazy thinking all the time without any real contact.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Classes start tomorrow, I'm getting a new roomie, the last one failed out from playing too many role playing games and not studying enough, and I have my name changed in all my documents. I haven't told anyone on campus yet. Guess it's easier when you don't have many friends. Who am I kidding, I don't think any of them even know who I am.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tomorrow, Shandi Zarev, the new, less inhibited version of Mary Jane Flatbush, emerges on the university scene. Why am I so nervous? Ok, why wouldn't I be? How do I really do it? Throw inhibitions to the wind and launch into an out-going, ready to meet people, persona?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ok, find the anti-anxiety meds from last semester and take a maximum dose, hope it lets me sleep. New roomie late tomorrow, first class 10 am. Fuck. Oh! There's a word Mary Jane wouldn't use. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Wow, that feels good! No wonder people use those words.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Have to make an appontment with Erica, get a new scrip for the anti-anxiety things. I think I'll need them again. Oh yeah, got to tell Erica what I'm doing. That'll be weird. I know she's a shrink and all, but I've seen some things rattle her. But she's been a good resource and she deserves to know what's going on, especially if I need her again!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ok, enough rambling, I've got to get some sleep.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">11 Jan 93</p>

<p class="regtxt5">What a fucking day! There I said it. What a Fucked Up Fucking Day!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Go to class and look the total moron because they call the new name and it doesn't register. So I sit there all stupid and make the instructor call my name four times. Then, I get back to my room and find the new room mate has already arrived and almost say the old fucking name when she introduces herself as Irena Valenskya. I think I recovered fast enough and the claim of a migraine helped too.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">12 Jan 93</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Today was better. I didn't come off the total moron in today's classes and the library staff, other than some funny looks, started using the new name.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena is, I don't know, pleasant, as a roomie. She doesn't snore, doesn't use the god-awful alarm clock to get up, and is good at conversation. Pleasant, well, it's a good enough word for now. I hope she thinks I'm ok as a roomie.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ok, stop right there. I can't keep bending over to get along. If something bothers me, I'll tell her. If I like something, I'll tell her that too.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">14 Jan 93</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Long conversations with irena last night. I told her about my parents. Didn't mention the name thing, or any of that, yet. She was quite supportive. She lost a younger brother to luekemia. Damn, that sucks bad!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talk about 6 degrees of separation stuff, turns out she knows the game master my old roomie was playing with. They came from the same town and Irena lived in her dorm before moving in here. Irena said her name was Marla Sanger. I see that name a lot at the library. Now that I think about it she's always haunting the old books, architecture, and witchcraft sections, and scribling notes in a personal journal of some kind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Got to get my courage up for tomorrow somehow. I promised myself I'd go to Mr. Syn's, the local Goth Club, and at least listen to the music. Don't think I can dance, never could dance, but I have to go. I bought a couple of not too daring things to wear over the break, after making that promise.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">16 Jan 93</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Wow, I had a wonderful time last night. While I was getting ready I found out Irena had been into the club scene ever since she arrived. We went together and she talked me into dancing, after a few stiff drinks, but I did it!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We met some cute guys, drank way too much, and had a marvelous time. Makes me wish I had figured this out long ago.</p>
