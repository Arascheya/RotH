</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Irena needs to find something in Shandi's stuff that pertains to MYST and the like. Not the same things as Kreel in Kiril's stuff though. Shandi would be more focused on the events of the characters, the treachery of the brothers, the plight of Saavedro, Yeesha's background and confrontation over the Bahro. Shandi is a bit troubled in her own right and tends to side with the crazy people.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia has gone missing, Irena was interested in her and had been chatting her up at the pub over the past few weeks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* when game starts up again */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">create Shandi, Irena, Chani - definitely, maybe Irena's sister as well</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena posed for magazine and her "friends" from home call to chastise her. She is unrepentent.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Messages - Kreel and Irena</p>
<p class="regtxt5">First Message - Found Something Important - ms</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena,</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I found something today that I thought you ought to know about. Apparently my dear twin brother, Kiril, knows a whole lot more about this D'Ni stuff than he's ever let on. (And I'' bet Shandi does, too!) And to think he's kept all of it from ME...his own twin!!! I'm still not sure whether to be angry, hurt, or just shocked! We shared everything growing up...but I digress.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kiril, it seems, has been to some place called MYST. He has a journal about his adventures there and found it by...er, "accident" (that's another story I'll tell you later...don't have much time right now). I found his journal this morning and while he's out running a couple of errands for his work, I thought I'd take a peek. (Bad thing to do, I know, BUT I just HAD to know -- you know?) Seems that Apparently my dear twin brother, Kiril, knows a whole lot more about this D'Ni stuff than he's ever let on. (and I'll bet Shandi does, too) He just left for a couple of errands and while I was looking for a book I needed I "accidentally" (another story I'll tell more about when I have more time) found a journal -- journals actually...7 in all...he has titled just MYST. That's a name I've heard him mention and I've heard a lot down in D'Ni. I've just started reading it and I can't believe Kiril has kept all this from ME...his own TWIN. I don't know whether to be angry, hurt, or just shocked. We've NEVER kept secrets from one another...but I digress...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">According to the journal 15 years ago, Kiril and his family were vacationing in new Mexico and, being lovers of old books, they stopped in some dusty old used book store in some long lost Southwestern town. In a back room, his journal says, was a shelf filled with very old and odd looking books. According to his journal, some of these were familiar titles: Dickens, Tolstoy, Dumas...others were unknown to him. But one had no title on the spine but the word Myst on the front. Drat...I hear his car...got get this journal back right where I found it. More later!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">PS to earlier message</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena,</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Please don't say anything to Shandi about Kiril's MYST journal. If she talks to him and he finds out I looked at it, I could be in deep weeds!!!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thanks,</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kreel</p>

<p class="regtxt5">from Irena to Kreel - Something Interesting</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I went looking yesterday. I'm sorry I wasn't around last night. I had errands to run during the day and had to cover a night shift last night. Sometimes being manager sucks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi has the entire series of MYST games, which I remember seeing her play fairly often. Not finding anything in the way of books, I was going to play MYST, just to see what it would tell me. When I opened the case there was the game disk, but there was also an unmarked data disk as well. I kind of wish I hadn't found that. I thought it would be notes, like in Kiril's books. Instead it was her diary from around the time we first met. I don't know why she hadn't encrypted it, it was the first thing she taught me when I got a computer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So much happened to her that she didn't tell me about. I mean, she didn't have to tell me, we aren't lovers, or family, or anything like that...it's just I might have been able to help, make it less painful and hard, if she could have talked about it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I'm sorry, I'm rambling, it's just..I don't know...it just hurts to know my best friend was in so much pain and I wasn't given a chance to help. I'm going to take another look tomorrow, after she's gone to work, and see if she mentions anything related to D'Ni, and try and not to read any more personal bits.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Update and Confusion</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I sure wish there was a way to jack a laptop into a KI and direct-upload data, ah well...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi spent most of the day working from home so I didn't get much chance to look through her stuff. Instead I spent the day at a local coffee shop, surfing the web for information. Now, I really am confused. I found lots of references to Cyan Worlds, MYST - the game, yet I also found detailed timelines and descriptions of events that seem too detailed to come from any game I'm familiar with.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Back home I had a chance to finish looking through the game cases. There was nothing else.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Shandi returned home last night, I asked her about MYST. She said they were games and that I could play them if I wanted. Then she added: "But they didn't get it right, not really. The puzzles are close, but the characters in the game were just cardboard cutouts of the real people. It was criminal how they were trivialized. But, play the games. When You're done I'll tell you what really happened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Back from Kreel</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Your message was interesting. Shandi's reaction to your innocent question and being defensive about them being "just games" sure seems a mite suspicious to me. Couple that with some of what you found on the internet and you gotta wonder.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Your suggestion about the net, by the way, inspired me to some checking as well. It seems that some people do consider the entire Myst enterprise as just a computer game series. But there are others who seem to think that the "game" is just a cover for something actually happening. Given our experiences with these linking books, I'd say something's up!!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">See you later</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kreel</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To Kreel</p>

<p class="regtxt5">RE: Cover Up</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sorry I haven't been around much of late. Surface matters have kept me very busy at work.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I have been slowly going through Shandi's games as time allows. Very interesting and very strange. She is still being cagey, not really talking much about what she does in cavern or where she spends her time. She has mentioned a bit about the DRC and the strange power struggles of a while ago. And she sent me links to the revived DRC forums and a game forum claiming to deal with Cavern affairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Interesting reading in both cases. Given the limited time I have to explore, I'm not sure how much these political events will effect my explorations, but power groups are rarely anyone's friend.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hope to see you soon!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena</p>

<p class="regtxt5">p.s. - happy Valentine's day past, if you do such things...:)</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Uru Reborn</p>

<p class="regtxt5">add to Irena's tales a message from Shandi when she gets back - communication from someone she knew on the DRC who spoke of the cavern re-opening - no real moneys for continued sxploratoin, but the cavern would be declared safe enough for visitors to return.</p>
