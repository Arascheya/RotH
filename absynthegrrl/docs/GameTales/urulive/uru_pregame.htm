<p class="regtxt5">When MOUL returns.....and may that come soon, whatever form of content is added and how, above all the story is the heart of the MOUL experience and i so look forward to a furthering of the story and the Journey, there is so much to learn and to think of......</p>

<p class="regtxt5">and in honor of that and thanks to the wonderful resources on John Lynch's Arcive , here is the very first Zandi Journey and the story of how it happened...to get us in the mood for new surprises... Smile</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yeesha Journey</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Journey #1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This was the very first journey that the majority of people knew about. Preperation for it began in in June, 2001 however it didn't truly begin until May, 2002 before ending sometime in 2003. Its purpose was to interest people in Yeesha's message by engaging them in a series of puzzles which would culminate in them going to D'ni and beginning Journey #2. Much like the other journeys, this one was split into several parts. However unlike future journeys, each part could only be completed once.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zandi Prime</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This began in 2001 when Jeff Zandi went to an inn called the Carlsbad Inn on Highway 62 near Carlsbad, New Mexico. He approached the manager and asked to place a picture on the back of his billboard and offered good money if he were allowed to do it. The manager of the inn told Zandi of a local sign man and a contract was paid for the sign to be placed for 1 year from June, 2001 to the end of May, 2002. The picture that was put up also had the co-ordinates N35 09.770, W106 43.084. Apparently Zandi's first intention was to have a series of co-ordinates attached to the image on the billboard, however for reasons unknown Zandi changed his plans.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In May, 2002 Zandi made a series of cryptic posts on the DRC forum to get people to go to the sign on the billboard which would be taken down at the end of May. It began with the Billboard thread as well as page. He made a final post in the form of changing Victor Laxman's username into his own and adding a PS note which can be read in this thread. For the first post Zandi's e-mail was 080401@N3217997W10416448 with the his e-mail changing for the second post to 080501@currentargus.com. The original "e-mail" were co-ordinates to the billboard with the second one involving a website located in New Mexico which would have served to reaffirm that the location was in New Mexico. However the people following Zandi's clues misunderstood the co-ordinates at first and thought they pointed to a location 24 km south of Carlsbad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Next Adreitz, one of the members of the forum, discovered a puzzle on Spyder's website, someone who had secretly released information from inside of Cyan through puzzles. His connection to Zandi isn't known, although it is possible Zandi contacted him somehow and asked his help. However after completing Spyder's puzzle, the members of the forum were still unsure what to do. The sign was taken down unseen by anyone from the DRC forum.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Next stage was during the Mysterium event where Myst fans got together. One of the attendees had a shirt that he wore with a picture of a spiral. The purpose of that is currently unknown, although it may have been worn with the hopes someone would ask them about it so they could provide some information. During Mysterium Zandi also sent a fax to them (that can be found here) on the 19th of July, 2002. The members of the DRC forum finally understood where Zandi's co-ordinates were pointing to.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The DRC forum members approached the members of the Yahoo New Mexico Geocaching forum about going to the GPS co-ordinates. While a couple did, it wasn't until Jim of Team Ziacache went and spoke with the inn manager that the sign was discovered. After this was announced by Jim, Zandi sent him and another geocacher who had been involved a link to a picture gallery Zandi had set up. At this stage Zandi had placed three pictures in the gallery, one of the t-shirt attendee during Mysterium, a partial of the picture that had been on the billboard along with a spiral design on a piece of paper. The DRC forum members eventually tied each image to three e-mail addresses Zandi had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The DRC forum members hit a dead-end until NetWatcher called the sign man in New Mexico and discovered the co-ordinates that had been attached to the image on the billboard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zandi One</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The co-ordinates connected with the sign on the billboard were to location around Boca Negra Canyon. Initial searches of the area didn't reveal anything so Zandi sent a further hint in an e-mail to a geocacher that can be read here. Geocacher Dave Plugge went to the area once more and after some further digging found a spiral. When Zandi planted the spiral is unknown, however it is possible he planted it back in 2001. Engraved on the back of the spiral was the work preafter which led to Zandi's website preafter.com.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The website's intention at this stage was to have a spiral dim after each part of the journey had been completed and would then link to whatever the final solution involved. The following spiral would then link to a clue to begin the next part of the journey. Zandi sent one more hint in a post on the geocaching website which can be read here. Dave Plugge sent the e-mail of the spiral and the first spike was dimmed and then linked to a page with the picture that was sent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zandi Two</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zandi placed a new link on the preafter website that led to a webpage that he updated with h a series of 10 digit numbers with the message "Personal proof is required." below those numbers. The DRC forum members were quick to realize the numbers were ISB numbers, which Zandi chose based on the letter of the first word in their title, and released them in an order that when the first letters from the titles were taken and placed together it spelt "ITS BENEATH THE TREE." The forum members didn't realize this at first but did realise they needed to send pictures themselves and the book, which they did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zandi edited the pictures to have numbers on them. The numbers pointed to specific words in the Myst books that had been published by Cyan Worlds. He used the format Book.Page.Paragraph.Word with the book corresponding to the D'ni numeral on the cover of each book. When placed together the words were to co-ordinates to the Tent Rocks monument in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He placed the images on his website and the explorers were quick to discover the co-ordinates. They also now they discovered the hidden message in the book titles.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Before Zandi revealed the final number, a website was set up to track a radio that Jim of Team Ziacache, Dave Plugge, and Mike S when they went to the location that the final number would reveal. Already knowing that they needed to be somewhere at Tent Rocks, the 3 geocachers went there on the day that Zandi revealed the final number. After the number was revealed, the 3 geocachers found the spiral and took a picture of it before e-mailing it to Zandi. Zandi then dimmed the second spike and placed a link to the picture with the third spike leading to the next clue.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zandi Three</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zandi selected a number of albums and took a word or number from each that when placed together would lead to a payphone number with the message "Be there October 26, 6 o'clock". To begin with Zandi placed the numbers 075992544726-7 onto the page. The first group of numbers are the Universal Product Code to Graceland by Paul Simon. The 7 referred to Zandi's wish for there to be 7 people in the picture that was to be sent to him. The purpose of having 7 people in the picture would be to foreshadow the fact that there would later be 7 journey cloths in Journey #2. However the 7 was misinterpretted by the forum members to refer to the track number. After they began searching for clues in this manner, Zandi finally sent them the message "Get off the track" which resulted in them correctly interpretting the 7.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After Zandi was sent a picture of the album with 7 people in the picture, he updated the page with a track number and time. The forum members worked out the purpose and the message was worked out. When Zandi called the payphone he provided the GPS co-ordinates N34 58.942 W107 29.185 and the third spiral was quickly discovered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zandi Four</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On the 1st of November, 2002 Zandi provided a link to a page titles Uru with a list of requirements that would be needed to enter D'ni, along with a message for people who did met those requirements to e-mail Zandi. The Uru title was to further the idea of a gathering that had been previously introduced in the group photos sent to Zandi. This page was updated on the 13th of November, 2002 after many people had e-mailed Zandi to say that he had enough people who met his requirements for now. The requirements Zandi had posted were not intended to be exclusionary, but were merely necessary to meet if someone wished to journey to D'ni. Aprroximately 1 week later a selection of people who had e-mailed Zandi was made and invited to begin Journey #2. Only a small percentage of those who originally e-mailed Zandi were selected, how they were selected is currently unknown.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While this was happening, Zandi Four had also begun on the 1st of November, 2002. Zandi had selected 14 movies to be used to encrypt his message "BE READY FOR A HIKE" which was in reference to those who he would invite to D'ni. He did this by providing the IMDB ID along with the message "Unique group proofs are required" along with the message to hint that the number was related to movies "Books... CDs... ??...". For this part of the journey Zandi decided to have pictures with the movie and a certain number of people in the picture. How people knew how many picture each movie required is unknown although it appears the first was done by luck witha barrage of proofs sent to him, with the successful one being with four people in it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After each proof had been sent Zandi would then place a quote on his website that corresponded to a specific scene in the movie. The explorers were able to get the scene numbers which when placed together corresponded to a URL on the preafter website, as well as the hidden message warning of a hike. However they misunderstood the numbers and thought them co-ordinates that were somewhere in Bluff City. Zandi stopped them from planning a trip there by sending the message "Bluff City. Don't go there" hinting that the numbers had purposely been a redherring. He then went on to say "Use the number at the site" which resulted in the URL: http://www.preafter.com/Four/36284728215725.html</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On the new URL Zandi had placed "Before and after" underlined with beneath it "Washington ------ Berlin." This was an old palor game that required a 6 letter word so that "Washington ------" and "------ Berlin" resulted in something that made sense. The answer was quickly discovered to be Irving. After it was discovered Zandi placed two more of these puzzles on it and the three missing words hinted at Millennium Park in Irving, TX.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On the 26th of November, 2002 Zandi posted the date 11/30/02 and time 2pm below the palor game puzzle before finally posting "Be at the fountain" the next day. On the 30th, DRC members LRBolt and Sowden went to the fountain at the Millenium Park at the correct time and met Zandi there. Zandi gave them the coordinates to the edge of the De-Na-Zin Wilderness alongside the Navajo Reservation in New Mexico. He also gave them the cryptic message "For the next stage, it's in your face." On the 1st of December, 2002 Rbnh00d222 went to the location and found the next spiral hidden in a rock formation that looked like the profile of a face when viewed from a certain angle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zandi Five</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This last portion of the journey began on the 5th of December, 2002 when Zandi posted a link to a new page on the 9th spike rather, which was unexpected as it was expected that the link would appear on the 5th spike. Zandi decided to have those who had the four spirals to meet and take a picture of the meeting with the spirals. However because they were spread out across at least two states, the owners of the spikes began to decide to just mail the spikes to a central location. Upon seeing this Zandi posted a message on his website asking them that this wasn't the preferred solution, but could be done if the owners meeting together was impossible. Eventually the owners of the spikes arranged to meet in Santa Fe, New Mexico on the 21st of December, 2002. Upon receiving the picture of the meeting, Zandi changed the spiral design to the hand present on journey cloths. The reason for the original design is still unclear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zandi Six</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zandi took down the requirements to go to D'ni on his website on the 2nd of January, 2003 before he sent this e-mail out asking people to sign up once more. Those that did receive an invitation to go to D'ni were later sent this e-mail.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Zandi Six began sometime in 2003 when Zandi asked for pictures of hand symbols from the journey cloths that people had made. The larger the symbol and more public the place the better. Zandi would accept a certain amount of pictures of the symbols of a certain size and public area before raising the bar and requiring a larger size and more public area. Those that he did accept were sent a t-shirt from him with the hand symbol on it and a link to the preafter website. This was the last part of the first journey.</p>
