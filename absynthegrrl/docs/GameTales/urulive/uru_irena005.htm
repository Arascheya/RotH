<p class="pagecaption">Chapter 5</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She faded into a large stone area. At first she thought it was a room, but the sounds of birds made her look up. She was at the bottom of a well-like courtyard with a patch of blue sky overhead. The air was warm and almost too humid, with scents of flowers and water. A small window showed clouds rotating by. Under her feet the rock vibrated and shuddered slightly, most likely the cause of the rotating sky. The open book with a circle above symbol from the pillar on her cloud island was everywhere. It was inlaid in the center of the well and it was the covering for the lights set into the walls.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A single open doorway led out of the courtyard. Slowly she approached it and looked into the next area. Even the open door had the symbol embossed into the rock, positioned so it would be a single image across the door if the door were closed. Right now it was separated into two halves. She shook her head and walked through into the next room. The doors were massive slabs of rock hung from an overhead track and resting on the floor. For each side of the door one slab hung facing the entry yard and a second one hung facing the next room. Each slab was three feet thick at the widest and over a foot thick at the narrowest. For a few moments she wondered what would require such heavy security, then she eased her way into the next room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The DRC easel with its white paper notice was jarring and reassuring at the same time. Something about this place was entirely too creepy with the massive stones and the quiet rumbling. Two grilled windows faced each other across the corridor, guard posts or check points of some kind. The DRC sign pointed to the open door across the way and indicated she should go deeper into the building for the KI device.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Beyond the door a corridor went to her left and to her right. To the left a small grouping of cones and a barricade blocked most of the passage before a closed door. To the right the passage ended in an open door. Directly across from her was another closed door. It did not respond to her touch. She slipped around the barriers and tried the other closed door with the same results. Beyond the open door was another stretch of hallway with a barricade set just beyond an open side door. Beyond the barricade was another closed door at the end of the passage. This time she didn't bother to try the closed door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The open door led into another rock chamber, slightly larger than the corridor. For a moment she considered investigating the strange items on the floor, but the unease that had been building the deeper into this place she ventured drove her to scan the room quickly for anything with the symbol from the DRC notes on it. Not finding it, she almost ran to the next door. On one wall was a strange round thing with cables and wires attached. In the center of it a symbol glowed, close enough to the DRC notes for her to approach it slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was examining it when a brief change in sound startled her. Her left hand shot out and slipped into the machine. Before she could yank it back out a cold blue beam snapped on and pinned her hand in place. The machine made a noise, another symbol lit for a few seconds, then everything turned off allowing her to pull her hand free. On her wrist was a strange watch-like device, held in place by a wide band. Panicked, she forgot about the book on her hip and ran to the book, on the pedestal, near the strange machine. She slammed her hand down on the image and sighed with relief as the creepy rock building faded from her view.</p>
