<p class="pagecaption">Klahraka - Origins</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Life in the Durotar wastes was brutal and harsh. Fighting was the currency for everything and if you weren't strong enough, you lost out. By the time I was seven I had figured out taking from others was better than fighting them. It was pretty simple most of the time. We aren't stupid, not like the other races think, but many of our fighters have been hit in the head a few too many times. It makes them less watchful and easier marks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cactus brew made life more bearable. Once I realized what the grown-ups were drinking, I began stealing my own. I'd take my water skin and slip around to various places, drain a bit from each, then find the back parts of the caves to hide and get drunk. It was more fun that getting beaten in mock combat like my brothers and sisters always were.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time I started to bleed, I was an accomplished requisitioner. I found that word in a book of words I lifted from a traveling adventurer. It means thief in a more pleasant way. Alright, it's a bit more involved than that, but I still like the word. Anyway, the first year I started to bleed was also the first time I skirted banishment. I had been too bold and had gotten caught by Urigtahr when I had tried to snag his second best knife. He had turned and seen me as I was leaving, blade in hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The headman, Gornek, had me confined while my parents argued my side and Urigtahr demanded satisfaction. Gornek told them he would decide in the morning, then he came to where I was. "You are a disgrace little Klahraka, but I will let you stay if you do something for me." His words stung more than I had expected, but I agreed and he went on, "Grimligsh has challenged me to leadership by combat. He had his brother, Targlith, take my weapon of office. If you steal it back, I will let you stay and banish Targlith instead. Fail, and you will be sent away. Here is the key, I expect to find my weapon in my cave in the morning and you still locked away in here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was the easiest acquisition I have ever done. Grimligsh and his brothers were sleeping off a massive drunken celebration. I had the weapon back and was back in my cell within a very short time. Gornek kept his word and I was allowed to stay. I've skirted banishment a few times since then, but every time Gornek would come through for me. I have done a few more dirty deeds for him as payment, but so far it has been mostly good for both of us.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I met Zroteyla when we were fourteen. She taught me a bit about hunting, I taught her a bit about being sneaking and drinking, and we taught each other about love. She had the curious way of humming that would vibrate her tusks and when she would rest one against my clit, it would send me into a frenzy. She liked it rough, demanding that I pinch and twist her nipples, claw her back and thighs, and ram my fingers into her ass and pussy. In return the smell of her blood and juices took me to the heights. We spent many hours in her cave screaming, and howling in passionate loving.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her parents walked in on us once. We stopped, tried to cover ourselves and waited for the outrage. Instead they growled "don't stop," almost in unison and yanked each other's clothes off. For a few minutes it was very weird, but the sounds of their passion soon had us going again. After that it was common for them to be nearby as we spent glorious afternoons and nights locked in loving.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We weren't in love, exactly, more like fuck buddies. We reached dizzying heights of passion but had little to keep us together long term. Zro would see boys on the side, but wouldn't let them fuck her. She didn't want to get pregnant and end up tied to a family. I had little interest in the orc or troll boys and spent my time honing my requisition skills.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was one incident that changed everything in my seventeenth year. There was another challenger to Gornek, one who favored combat as status even more than Gornek. This time there was no easy way to make him lose face and I was again facing banishment, this time without any supplies. Gornek came to me and promised a pardon if I removed the threat. "Let me be clear on this little Klahraka. If you do not do this, I will personally see you escorted to the top of the ridge and chained to a stake. You will be weaponless, naked, and without food and water. How long do you think you would last?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once again I agreed. This group was paying attention. I had slipped out in the middle of the night but found the cave well watched, with the fires tended and guards alert and on patrol. It felt strange to kill someone. I had gone hunting and killed food, but never had I killed another someone. When the knife slid through the first guard's flesh and the blood sprayed, it was intense. I remember the feel of it spraying on me and liking the warmth and wetness of it. I deliberately stood where each new kill could add his blood to that already dripping from my clothes and running across my skin. I had thought I'd only have to kill a few, but in the end all the guards were dead and I was bleeding from dozens of cuts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time I reached his chamber the blood was clotting and drying on my clothes, making them stiff and uncomfortable. I left them in a side cave and approached him naked. The blade slid in from behind and his eyes widened as I stepped in front of him. The blood splashed on my face and breasts and I dropped the knife to rub it into myself. As the light faded from his eyes I lifted my hand and licked the salty blood from my fingers. My hands danced across my breasts and down to my clit. I traced circles around myself, then plunged my fingers deep inside. I came in shuddering waves as I rolled in the blood on the cave floor, glad that my screams wouldn't summon anyone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gornek found me sprawled naked in my cell, dried blood covering me, and numerous scabs on my wounds. He healed me, threw water over me until the was no more blood, and handed me fresh clothes.His face showed disgust but the bulge in his leggings said otherwise. I made a great show of letting him see my sex as I bent over to pull on the clothes. His face turned red as I looked at him and licked my lips. He reached for the cell door but I shook my head, "No touching."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I won't pardon you," he growled, sliding his key in the lock.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's enough questionable evidence to point to you doing the slaughter," I replied sweetly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Abomination," he snarled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Honorless user," I answered back. I tried not to let his words hurt, but they danced around in my head. "And what does that make you? Someone who deals with an abomination is even lower."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll protect you," he spat out, "But I want you gone. You'll have to go through the coming of majority that everyone else does, otherwise it'll look suspicious, and then you will go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Consider me gone when the tasks are over."</p>
