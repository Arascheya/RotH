<p class="pagecaption">Satyari - Origins</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Life in the tiny village was so incredibly boring. We had been far enough from the center of everything that the big battles of the Scourge had only been a distant rumbling of rumor. Daily life revolved around the garden plot and the fields we worked. My older brothers were fine with it, but I chafed under the constant sameness. Any time I tried to ask about the wars, my father or mother would hush me and send me to my bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I didn't even know I had an Aunt Eleran until a rider came to our house to say she had died. My mother took the news very poorly but my father just looked annoyed. Mother insisted on going to the next village, being part of the mourning and funeral services, and gathering up her things. Father just continued to look annoyed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The arguments started once they thought we were all asleep. "You know what she was. We should stay away from her," father hissed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She was my sister and I owe this to her. She wasn't always that way. Once she was like Satyari, sweet, kind, loving," mother replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Loving? Have you seen how she holds her brother's baby? It's like she's holding a sack of grain. There's no warmth in her. I fear she's just like your sister. Already she craves the adventurer's life. You've seen how she hangs on the words of any stranger that comes through the village. I've tried, we've tried, to change her, but I fear she is one of the lost."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. No! You are wrong about her. I know she'll come to the light. I know she will. It's just some aren't meant to be farmers. We need to let her go, let her come back of her own will. The harder we try to force her into this life, the more she will pull away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And that worked so well with your sister. I won't fight you on this, but I fear for you when she ends the same way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We left the next morning in the family wagon. We were at the next village by mid-day and at the hut that had belonged to my aunt a few minutes later. It was set slightly apart from the rest of the homes. My father went to gather the mourners while my mother went inside. I trailed her in and took a look around. Nothing supported the fear my father had shown the night before. It was clean, tidy, and as boring as our home. My aunt lay on her bed, surrounded by the cloud of flies that always gathered after death. She looked peaceful in death. I moved closer to examine her, fascinated by the look of death. She wasn't the first I had seen, but something about the dead always interested me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Satya, get away from there. You don't need to see her that way," mother was openly crying as she gathered up the meager belongings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why not? It's as much a part of life as living."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why must you be so creepy? Noone likes it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why is it creepy to realize life and death are connected. Why do you fear it so? It is just another change, like going from girlhood into womanhood."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come with me. We need to make the proper preparations." I followed her back into the sunlight but my mind was still thinking about my aunt. There was nothing in her hut that should have scared people, yet the fear was there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I dutifully followed my mother around, talking to the boring people, and acting appropriately distraught. When I had a chance, I slipped away and back into the hut. I stood in the center of the single room and thought about where I would hide something very important. At last I sprang to the fire pit and carefully brushed away the ash and coals and then the coarse sand. One of the flat rocks underneath looked like it had been disturbed more recently than the others. Under it was a small scrap of hide with a crude map on it that pointed the way to a small cave in the mountains to the north. I slipped it inside my dress, put the stone and ashes back, and went back to the group.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Back in our village I waited a few days, until I could slip away unnoticed and head into the hills. The map led to a small cave, barely fifty feet deep, but hidden in brambles and brush enough to remain hidden. Inside was a small brazier, a large table, and various scattered parchments and scrolls. I tried to be slow and careful, but found myself scanning each one and moving on until one stopped me. I read it over and over until I thought I understood it and then I raised my hands and concentrated.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Black, oily energy oozed through me, focusing in a clot at the edge of my fingertips. A flick of fingers and mind set it racing toward the wall. A dark violet flash erupted as a chip of stone blasted loose from the cavern. A harsh grin split my lips and I tried once more. The oily energy fizzed and sped along my nerves and erupted in a steady melon sized projectile, screaming to the wall and blasting a chunk of rock loose. I screamed in triumph. I understood in an instant my father's fear and my aunt's path.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The decision to leave was simple. I packed my meager belongings that night and slipped through the dark toward the Northshire Abbey and the road to Goldshire.</p>
