<p class="pagecaption">Irishkah - Orgrimmar</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I arrived at the Orgrimmar flight tower after what seemed to be a short flight. The air over the city was full of flying patrols, smoke rose from countless forges and fires, beings hurried from place to place with weapons and supplies, and great fortifications were rising under hordes of laborers and make-shift hoists. The tower guard gave me a brief look and motioned me to the stairs down to the ridge of rock above the linked valleys of the city. "Ask anyone below for directions," she said as she turned to help departing passengers onto the zeppelin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Excuse me, but why can't I remember much of the flight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned back to me with a mild look of annoyance. "I don't know. Magic, I guess. I've never bothered to ask. Now, if you don't mind?" she said, motioning to the crowd. I nodded and turned away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bright heat of Durotar beat down, driving the gloom and cold of the Undercity from me. The dry air shimmered in the distance. Bright sunlight painted the barren rocks and sand in patterns of red, ochre, and brown. Gnarled, stunted trees poked up in random locations, thrusting greenish yellow foliage into the heat. It was a strange land after my home lands, but beautiful in a harsh and barren kind of way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I walked around the rock upthrust that held the flight towers and wyvern master. Smells of cooking meat, spices, dung, animals, and incense rose from the valleys wrapped around the rock. The sound of drums and music mingled with the sounds of people and beasts. A lazy wind would puff across the rise, dissipating some of the heat from the sun hammering down on the barren rock.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was slightly cooler in the valleys. I had used one of the lifting platforms to descend into the valley, sharing it with stacks of cargo and a black vapor spewing goblin contraption. Everything in this new place was loud, raucous, and vibrant. As I wondered among the orcs, trolls, goblins, and tauren, I began to understand why my sister found Silvermoon City so stifling. Everything there had moved in a slow, measured pace, unchanged by time while everything in Orgrimmar was in constant change.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The day passed quickly while I explored the shops, taverns, and other places of the city. I found myself in the Valley of Spirits as the sun sank below the edge of the valleys. This valley was and oasis of cool air, gently flowing water, and relative calm after the bustle in the rest of the city. Too tired to go any further, I turned to the nearest inn, run by the troll Sijambi. The open form of the bent tree and thatch building was far more inviting than the enclosed stone, iron, and slate buildings of other areas in the city. For a small sum, I was given a simple dinner, bedding, and a sleeping pallet near the top of the building. The sleeping area was open, just spaces to throw bedding over simple pads on the floor. There was a privy area behind woven grass mats for changing and other duties. A steady breeze rose as the sun set and the land began to cool. The music drifting through the valley helped me slip into a deep and dreamless sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">The sun was just rising when someone stumbled over me and fell heavily on the floor near my head. I had thought I had managed to be outside the path when I set up my pallet, but the room had filled almost to overflowing between nightfall and morning. The young troll woman stammered out an apology as she pushed herself up. Trolls were strange that way, they seemed so clumsy when walking or running, but they were poetry in motion when they danced, and they danced a lot.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No harm done. I was waking up anyway," I replied as she finished her apology.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You be Sloak?" she asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You be knowin' Sloak?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sloak be seen with a friend. I be tryin' to find dem. Dey last seen headin' dis way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who you be?" she blushed a darker shade of blue under her skin tone and stumbled over an explanation, "That was blunt, mon, I be sorry. I ain't seen many non-kin dat stay in our buildings. Dey like da stone walls around dem." Rather than get to her feet, she twisted around until she was sitting near me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Jen'ne'esha trips over her in the morning, that is how they first meet. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Irishkah arrives at the flight tower and spends some of the day wandering the city. she is drawn to the troll enclave because of the music and the unabashed joy of life they seem to have. */</p>
