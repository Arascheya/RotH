<p class="pagecaption">Irishkah - Origins</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The note, written in mother's hand, came to my rooms just after I had met Mythria. I had taken rooms at Velandra's inn in Silvermoon City and begun serious study with the Blood Knights at the temple in Farstrider Square. The note asked that I return immediately, something had happened that she didn't wish to entrust to a note.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Father explained what had happened as soon as I entered our home. My younger sister, Narshala, had disappeared the night before. They had searched her room but all she had taken were a few clothes and her dagger. Her training armor, sword, and shield were still hanging in neat order within the closet. Mother was frantic having arranged the hand-fasting with Fenryssal Windsinger for two days later. Father was grim and determined, looking hard at me and saying, "You wanted to prove yourself, Irishkah, here is your chance. Find your sister before she brings dishonor on us all. See that she is back here in time for the ceremony and don't return without her. I will send word to the temple and clear this with the Order for you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I drew myself up straight, touched sword pommel to forehead and replied, "Yes sir!" in my best paladin tones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She didn't say anything to you, did she?" mother asked. "She was becoming distant with me, but I couldn't find out why."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had a couple of suspicions, but didn't want to voice them without proof. Mother would have been crushed and father would have been more angry than he already was. "No mother. Nar has told me nothing. It might just be nerves, you have arranged a wonderful marriage for her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I turned to leave, hesitated in case there were further words, then slipped out into the late afternoon light. It was a prestigious marriage, but I wouldn't have said good. Fenryssal was a pompous windbag, more interested in his exploits and advancement than in anyone around him. Narshala would have been a trophy-wife, sitting at his side during feasts, but left to herself most other times.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had hoped to find Narshala at her favorite place, the Shrine of Dath'Remar. The shrine oozed a chill, dark presence that had fascinated her. All I found was a quick note, tucked behind the plaque, in a space where we had traded notes as children. "Ri, I have to leave. I wish I could tell you where I went and why, but I know father will send you after me. Please, know that I love you, my dear sister. Be well and try not to think too badly of me when you learn the truth. Nar."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took until moon rise to find someone that could tell me whom to ask about my sister. One of her training companions told me Narshala would always go off with Saritavya, the warlock, after weapons training. Mother was going to be pissed, father livid, and Fenryssal's family would call everything off. I was supposed to be angry as well, but it made some sense to me. Nar was always interested in the darker things, drawn to the pools of strange left after the Scourge.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Saritavya..." I had found her in her small home, sitting at a floating desk, reading some half unrolled scroll.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was wondering when I would see you, Irishkah," she replied as the scroll rolled itself back up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where is my sister?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Safe. She doesn't want to be a paladin, but I think you already knew that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not that simple. There's duty, honor, expectations..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you have done all those things. Why does your family expect everyone to be the same? Do you expect Shala to be just like you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not entirely, no. I knew she wasn't happy but I thought it was because the training was so hard for her, not that she didn't want to do it. But it's still not that simple. My father told me not to come back without her. Now my future is tied to this as well and I know him, he won't back down on this. The marriage was a matter of pride and another alliance of power to him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What will you do, then? She won't want to come back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. Every paladin in the Horde knows my family. If I don't bring her back, we'll both be hunted. If I try to bring her back we will fight and hurt each other. I don't want to give up what I am, but I don't want to hurt my sister either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aren't there some in the order that oppose your family? Could you go to them for training and information on safe places?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's Cyssa Dawnrose, my mother's sister. She fled to the lands of the Forsaken after serious arguments with my father over how he treated mother and what his plans are. My family would never go there, unless it were to kill Forsaken, which would be bad for our alliance. Cyssa is on friendly terms with Sylvanas Windrunner, the Banshee Queen. But I don't want to lose my family. Maybe I could bring her back and she could run away again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're not a fool. Don't try to play one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're right," I sighed heavily. "She's never be able to and she'd fade away with Fenryssal. So I hurt my sister or my parents. My parents have lots of people and my sister has no one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I started to fidget, then squirm as Saritavya studied me for a very long. "You should talk to your aunt in the Undercity. She might know where your sister went."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You came and talked to me, but I didn't know anything either. I don't know where you went to look after that. You'll be alright. It'll hurt for quite a while and, maybe, sometime in the future there can be a reconciliation."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I left Saritavya's and wandered the higher hills of Sunstrider Isle. The sun was setting when I came across Matron Arena, priestess and advisor to many on Sunstrider Isle. "You seem troubled, Irishkah. Is there any way I may help?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, I don't know. Narshala has run away and I have to go bring her back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The hand-fasting, yes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I don't blame her for running, yet father will have me cast out of the Order if I don't bring her back, yet bringing her back will destroy her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What does your heart tell you is the right course of action?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My father wants to manipulate and control, my sister just wants to live."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then you know the answer, don't you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I nodded heavily and walked slowly back home where I gathered my gear and headed out. Mother pulled me into a tight hug and said softly, "I love you and I know you will do what is right." I held her tightly for a long moment, then released her and stepped away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Father touched his palm to my chest, "Bring her back. Make me proud." I nodded, turned, and left.</p>
