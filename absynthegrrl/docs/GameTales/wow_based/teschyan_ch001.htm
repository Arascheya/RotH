<p class="pagecaption">Teschyan - Origins</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I came of age in the manicured beauty of the forests of Sunstrider Island. Stately, sculpted trees arched over perfectly trimmed lawns of immaculate green. The weather never changed, allowing outdoor living spaces and work areas, all as perfectly kept as the surroundings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My training into the knighthood began almost at my birth with stories from my father, grand father, and mother. I never thought there would be any path for me other than through the ranks. When I reached puberty I began to have second thoughts. All the talk about the Light and the holy order of things didn't fit the world around me. We lived in a faded beauty, with scars of destruction spearing through it. Magical energies corrupted more people than they helped and the knighthood stood in aloof judgement of it all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I took to prowling the edges of my culture, talking to those who followed the darker arts, the shadowy figures that the knighthood denied the existence of, but everyone knew about. I talked to the thieves, the mages, and the warlocks. Each had a story to tell about the forces of the light and how they ignored vast numbers of our people. Slowly I was seduced away from the knighthood and my family's traditions. I began to seek the darker paths, although I never fell so far as to consider the dark sorceries of the warlock.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Every spare minute I had was spent with Arathelyas, learning the arts of the mage. The energy flowing through me soothed a raw ache deep within. My race was prone to addiction and corruption by the arcane energies used in magic, but like so many before me, I was certain I could control it. There were times in my training where I came so close to crossing the line, however, I was always able to turn aside at the last minute.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Arathelyas taught me of love as well. With her I learned that I was drawn to women, not to men, and particularly, not the men of the blood elves. My family was busy making other plans for me as I was off learning magic and spending time with my teacher.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As my childhood approached an end, my mother explained they had arranged a hand-fasting between Fenryssal Windsinger and myself. Fenryssal was a promising young lieutenant in the knighthood and was thought to be a rising star, headed for the highest ranks. This arrangement revealed just how well connected my family was within the knighthood and how lucky I was. Unfortunately, I had encountered young Fen a few times and found him to be repulsive. He was a braggart and an ass-kisser. He was somewhat competent with his weapons, but had no concept of tactics or command.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I managed to look excited enough to not prompt any questions, but as soon as my mother left I was pacing my room, wondering what to do. As soon as darkness fell I slipped out and ran for Arathelyas. She was quite blunt in her analysis, "You either have to go along with their wishes, or you will have to flee."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Many among our people accept mages and even warlocks, however, your family is one of the staunchest supporters of the Purity Acts and only support magic through the auspices of the knighthood. Surely you already know this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I am their daughter and they love me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Never bet on love to win over fanaticism. Your parents are fanatics and you will lose to their zeal. If you attempt to stand up to them, you will be disowned, disavowed, and possibly banished. This might happen in absentia, but you have a better chance of being able to return later and beg forgiveness for your actions. I know a mage in the Undercity, the city of the Forsaken, that could continue your education. You will need to put aside the prejudices of our race and learn to accept the Forsaken to follow this path."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The undead? I don't know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Forsaken. The undead are the tools of the Lich King. The Forsaken are free beings, like you and I, that make their own destiny in the world. Like any other people, there are the good, the bad, and the totally messed up. The good are as good as you or I. Just remember they have their own goals and choose your friends among them with care. The mage I am sending you to, Anastasia Hartwell, I would trust with my life."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure? The stories..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are just that. Think of the stories told by your family and then by others of our people. It's the same thing. You should leave as soon as you can. Any delay might further entangle you in their plans."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do I get to the Undercity? Is there something I should tell Anastasia?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Follow the road to Falconwing Square, then go through the south gate. Turn to your left and enter the main section of Slivermoon City and go to the Orb of Translocation in the Sunfury Spire. It will send you to the ruins of Lordaeron and from there you can easily find your way into the Undercity. Tell Anastasia that you know me and that I sent you to her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We embraced for a long time, made long, slow love, and then I ran for home. Grabbing only the most essential items, I filled a small pack and slipped out. I though about leaving a note but decided not to. I'd send a note through the mails when I felt safe enough, until then, better they not have any idea where I was.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was dawn when I walked into the square in front of the Sunfury Spire. I expected the guards to challenge me, but no one did. It seemed the Orb was used by many different peoples. I saw large cow faced tauren, green skinned orcs, and even a blue skinned troll coming from the Orb. Reddish energy swirled and pulsed around the central sphere, drawing the eye and inspiring dread at the same time. It took a moment to prepare myself to walk toward it. Tendrils swept out, enfolded me, pulled me apart and blackness sucked me away from the screaming agony.</p>
