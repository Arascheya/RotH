<p class="pagecaption">Irishkah - The Hunt Begins</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everyone knew where the Orb of Translocation was and everyone knew it was open to all. While the concept was easy, the reality was not. I stood a long time in front of it, staring into the slowly spinning device and watching the shimmers of energy floating around it. At last I approached, reached out, and touched the shimmering field. Warmth enfolded me, cushioning me for a few, almost sacred, moments, then released me into the ruins of Lordaeron.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gloomy grey skies spit rain through the skeletal fingers of ruined buildings. Weeds choked the courtyard, competing with graves to clutter the space. I had heard of the path to the Undercity and began walking it quickly. The throne room and mausoleum behind it had been cleared of rubbish, however, the rain still filtered down through the holes in the roof, dripping icy tendrils down my back. Obscene horrors guarded a dropping room to the main city. The tunnels were damp, dank, and smelled of mold and other unnamed things. I could feel the tons of earth above me, pressing down, trying to fill the empty spaces. The tunnel opened to a central shaft where rotting banners were hung in a loathsome parody of festivities on the surface. Every stone surface was carved and worked into skull, fang, and bone shapes. Thick greenish sludge oozed slowly from grinning skull mouths and plopped heavily into the open troughs at the base of the shaft. The chamber was lit by smoking lanterns and a noisesome putrid green phosphorescence from the thick sludge. A sharp, acrid stench rose from it, more intense when bubbles of gas would erupt on the surface.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Forsaken shuffled to and fro in their bent, stumbling gait. Flesh gaped, exposing bone and sinew at the joints. Rotting clothes hung in ragged tatters from them, yet they wore them as if they were the latest fashion. The smiles and the greetings they gave me felt alien in this cold, ugly place. It took enormous control to force polite smiles in return and keep my feet from turning and bolting for the tunnel out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took several inquiries to find the right set of passages to the royal area and Cyssa Dawnrose. My skin was crawling and it took every ounce of will not to flinch and jerk whenever a Forsaken would talk to me. No one paid me any special notice as I made my way to the throne room and Cyssa at her station near the Banshee Queen. "Lady Ambassador, may I have a word?" I said, dropping to one knee and waiting.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rise. What is it, paladin? Wait, you are Irishkah Tathalyas, Evester's daught, are you not?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, lady."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She peered at me closely. "What brings you here? I know of your family's dislike of this place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I seek news of my sister, Narshala, lady."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh please, stop with the lady nonsense. We are kin through your mother. Why do you think your sister would be here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I explained what little I knew, then continued, looking down from her gaze, "May I, may I appeal to you for training and sanctuary? I cannot return without my sister, yet to do so is to condem her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you really believe that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. My father will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, and mother dares not oppose him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"True. He is more of a tyrant than many of the rulers I have seen. I will train you, or, should this place be too much for you, seek out Master Pyreanor in Orgrimmar. His family is also suspicious of your father's intent. As to your sister, I am not certain she is here right now. She was here, talking to Luther Pickman, but she didn't say if she was going to remain. You could go talk with him," she continued at my visible twitch, "Or I can ask around, discreetly, and see. You can return and check with me in a few days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes please!" I responded in relief. "How do I get to Orgrimmar?" Cyssa detailed the path, from the Lordaeron ruins, to the flight tower, and the zeppelin ride to Orgrimmar. I almost ran from the claustrophobic darkness of the Undercity. The dim twilight of the Forsaken lands was almost as bad as the pressure of the earth overhead in the city. It wasn't until I was on the zeppelin, and passing out of the Forsaken lands, that I started to feel better.</p>
