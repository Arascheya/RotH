<p class="pagecaption">Arascheya - Origins</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was gone. In the middle of the night my younger sister, Teschyan, disappeared. We searched her room but all she had taken were a few clothes and her dagger. Her training armor, sword, and shield were still hanging in neat order within the closet. Mother was frantic having arranged the hand-fasting with Fenryssal Windsinger for two days later. Father was grim and determined, looking hard at me and saying, "You wanted to prove yourself, here is your chance. Find your sister before she brings dishonor on us all. See that she is back here in time for the ceremony and don't return without her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I drew myself up straight, touched sword pommel to forehead and replied, "Yes sir!" in my best paladin tones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She didn't say anything to you, did she?" mother asked. "She was becoming distant with me, but I couldn't find out why."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had a couple of suspicions, but didn't want to voice them without proof. Mother would have been crushed and father would have been more angry than he already was. "No mother. Yan has told me nothing. It might just be nerves, you have arranged a wonderful marriage for her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I turned to leave, hesitated in case there were further words, then slipped out into the early morning light. It was a prestigious marriage, but I wouldn't have said good. Fenryssal was a pompous windbag, more interested in his exploits and advancement than in anyone around him. Teschyan would have been a trophy-wife, sitting at his side during feasts, but left to herself most other times.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took most of the day to find someone that could tell me whom to ask about my sister. One of her training companions told me Teschyan would always go off with Arathelyas after weapons training. The mage trainer, so that was what little sister was up to. Mother was going to be pissed, father livid, and Fenryssal's family would call everything off. I was supposed to be angry as well, but it made some sense to me. Yan was always interested in the things she wasn't supposed to be.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Arathelyas..." I had found her in her small home, sitting at a floating desk, reading some half unrolled scroll.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was wondering when I would see you, Arascheya," she replied as the scroll rolled itself back up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where is my sister?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Safe. She doesn't want to be a paladin, but I think you already knew that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not that simple. There's duty, honor, expectations..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you have done all those things. Why does your family expect everyone to be the same? Do you expect Teschya to be just like you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not entirely, no. I knew she wasn't happy but I guess I thought it was because the training was so hard for her, not that she didn't want to do it. But it's still not that simple. My father told me not to come back without her. Now my future is tied to this as well and I know him, he won't back down on this. The marriage was a matter of pride and another alliance of power to him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What will you do, then? She won't want to come back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. Every paladin in the Horde knows my family. If I don't bring her back, we'll both be hunted. If I try to bring her back we will fight and hurt each other. I don't want to give up what I am, but I don't want to hurt my sister either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aren't there some in the order that oppose your family? Could you go to them for training and information on safe places?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's Cyssa Dawnrose, my mother's sister. She fled to the lands of the Forsaken after serious arguments with my father over how he treated mother and what his plans are. My family would never go there, unless it were to kill Forsaken, which would be bad for our alliance. Cyssa is on friendly terms with Sylvanas Windrunner, the Banshee Queen. But I don't want to lose my family. Maybe I could bring her back and she could run away again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're not a fool. Don't try to play one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're right," I sighed heavily. "She's never be able to and she'd fade away with Fenryssal. So I hurt my sister or my parents. My parents have lots of people and my sister has no one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I started to fidget, then squirm as Arathelyas studied me for a very long. "You should talk to your aunt in the Undercity. Your sister is there as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You came and talked to me, but I didn't know anything either. I don't know where you went to look after that. You'll be alright. It'll hurt for quite a while and, maybe, sometime in the future there can be a reconciliation."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* could switch to use "official" mage trainer on Sunstrider Isle - Julia Sunstriker */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Arascheya doesn't like the Undercity much - too confined, smells odd - of corpses and has an evil feel, and is dark, dreary, and cold, and the green goo really disturbs her */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gloomy grey skies spit rain through the skeletal fingers of ruined buildings. Weeds choked the courtyard, competing with graves to clutter the space. I had heard of the path to the Undercity and began walking it quickly. The throne room and mausoleum behind it had been cleared of rubbish, however, the rain still filtered down through the holes in the roof, dripping icy tendrils down my back. Obscene horrors guarded a dropping room to the main city. The tunnels were damp, dank, and smelled of mold and other unnamed things. I could feel the tons of earth above me, pressing down, trying to fill the empty spaces. The tunnel opened to a central shaft where rotting banners were hung in a loathsome parody of festivities on the surface. Every stone surface was carved and worked into skull, fang, and bone shapes. Thick greenish sludge oozed slowly from grinning skull mouths and plopped heavily into the open troughs at the base of the shaft. The chamber was lit by smoking lanterns and a noisesome putrid green phosphorescence from the thick sludge. A sharp, acrid stench rose from it, more intense when bubbles of gas would erupt on the surface.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Forsaken shuffled to and fro in their bent, stumbling gait. Flesh gaped, exposing bone and sinew at the joints. Rotting clothes hung in ragged tatters from them, yet they wore them as if they were the latest fashion. The smiles and the greetings they gave me felt alien in this cold, ugly place. It took enormous control to force polite smiles in return and keep my feet from turning and bolting for the tunnel out.</p>
