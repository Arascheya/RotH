<p class="pagecaption">Teschyan - Undercity</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stumbled on the rough stones of a ruined hall. Pain was a distant memory behind a fading warmth and tingling of the translocation magic. Dark green tinged grey skies spit a chill rain through the shattered roof. An overgrown courtyard lay beyond the only open door and a forlorn wind howled softly through shattered stone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I crossed to the door, out onto a raised porch and to the steps down to the courtyard. Old graves marred what was once an immaculate lawn. A strange greenish yellow liquid flowed sluggishly in the moat below a lowered bridge. Bent figures shambled across the bridge, past the closed main doors, and across a narrow grass sward to open side doors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you needing help?" A thin, breathy voice asked from behind me. I spun and beheld another of the shambling ones. Bluish-green flesh gaped open to the bone at her joints, tendons ticked and popped as she moved, yet she didn't seem in discomfort. Her eyes glowed with a strange yellowish light and her mouth was pulled into a rictus-like smile. She stood relaxed and easy under my gaze as my hand tightened instinctively on my staff. Her face had been pretty, in a way it still was, although the ragged holes, where her cheeks had been, were disturbing at best. Coarse greyish-blue hair stuck up and out from her head and rotting robes hung from her shriveled frame.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stared at her, at the leaden sky overhead, and the shattered buildings around me. I have tried to understand what happened, but I still don't know how it suddenly became beautiful to me. Something about the imperfections called up a love of place that I had never felt in the perfection of the soaring towers, floating palaces, and manicured loveliness of Sunstrider Isle and Eversong Wood. I smiled at her and asked, "Is this Lordaeron? Am I near the Undercity?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, this is Lordaeron. I can show you to the Undercity entrance. What has brought you here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am seeking the magician, Anastasia Hartwell, to continue my training."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have trained under her. But, aren't there magicians where you lived? Why come here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My life was not to be my own at home."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome then. I will take you to see Anastasia."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May we exchange names? I am Teschyan Brightmoon."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of the Brightmoons that are paladins? No wonder you fled. We may, although you are being very trusting, giving me your name. I am Irislaynya. You might not want to mention Brightmoon in the city. Many here are not fond of paladins, considering so many hunt us for sport."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I followed Irislaynya through the left side door, past shattered statues, bricked up doors, and through ruined chambers until we came to a door between two grotesque figures. Each one pulsed and shimmered with a sickly green aura. In their hands were enormous clubs. Glazed, bleary eyes peered from the sliding flesh of their ruined faces. Bones stuck out from their rib cages and viscera hung from gaping abdominal wounds. A smell of old dust, damp earth, decay, and a faintly acidic tang surounded them. Iris was surrounded by a fainter version of it as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Those weird things should have horrified me, instead, I found them fascinating. They didn't seem to mind when I circled them, examining them from every angle, before moving on through the door. Iris watched with a sense of indulgence and spoke when we walked away, "Not many are so calm the first time they encounter us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is all so new and different from the enforced perfection of my home. The contrasts here are like a breath of wind through an overly perfumed garden, or a torn bit of cloth on a courtier's gown." The circular floor of the chamber dropped swiftly as I finished speaking. I stumbled and would have pitched forward if her chill hand hadn't grabbed me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a bit startling the first time. You get used to it." The floor dropped thirty or more meters before grinding to a halt and revealing a door across from us. "This way." She led the way down a short series of corridors and stepped out onto a platform near the top of a circular space. It was so beautiful it stopped me in my tracks and took my breath away. Massive stone blocks had been used to hold back the earth under the ruins. Lanterns cast a warm yellow light over intricate carvings of skulls and bones, festive banners hung from carved stone horns, greenish liquid oozed from skull shaped drains and added a pale yellow-green phosphorescent glow, further warming the cool blues, greys, and browns of the stone. Forsaken hurried about, talking of old quests, haggling and bartering for weapons and goods. Giant bats flew in and out through a high, round tunnel, depositing more visitors and taking others away. In front of me the floor dropped away, connected to a central column by wide wooden bridges.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's..it's so beautiful!" Tears clogged my eyes and throat, making it hard to speak the words. I pulled Iris into an impromptu hug, then backed away quickly as I realized what I had done. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. My parents have always said I'm too open. Can you forgive me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her cool hand touched my cheek for a moment. "Yes. Do you really think it's beautiful?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes! And so are you," I dropped my head and blushed furiously as I realized I had said it all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are a strange one. Let's go find Anastasia." We went down the nearest ramp to the top platform of the central column. "These are the bankers." She motioned toward the grilled windows set into the central area. Next, she pointed at several small platforms jutting from the outer wall, "Those are various vendors and trainers." We descended a set of stairs to the lowest point, crossed a bridge over the greenish liquid, and through a tunnel into another vaulted, circular hall. "On the inside wall are the auctioneers." We crossed the hall and exited through another tunnel. "This is the outer ring. There are four main quarters, war, magic, rogue's, and apothecarium. There is also an entrance to the sewers and the entrance to the royal section. Anastasia is in the magic quarter." We followed the bank of a large cannal, filled with more greenish liquid, until we came to an arching stone bridge.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is the green liquid toxic?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She gave me a very odd look, "No, why?" I took a running leap and dove for the water, ignoring her cry of, "What the hells...?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was cool, almost cold, fizzing and bubbling with strange gases, thick and murky with a bright yellowish glow, and it tingled on my skin like warm summer sun. I swam down, looking for the bottom, found it to be rather shallow, and swam along it for a small way before swimming back for the surface. As my head broke the surface understanding hit with the first breath. The liquid contained raw, unfocused, untapped potential magical energy. It soothed the soul deep ache that had been with me all my life. I didn't have to focus it, channel it, or risk myself, I could let it enfold and comfort me without fear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slowly walked up the steps on the far side, watching as the liquid drained off in thick ropes, pulling itself away from my skin and clothing, and draining back into the canal. As it left, I slid slowly down to recline against the chill stone, eyes half lidded, feeling better than after any orgasm I had ever had. Iris hurried up and I smiled radiantly up at her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What were you thinking?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, that felt soooo good!" I moaned in response.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The green liquid is highly magical and is the basis for the elixer that animates us. Shall we continue, crazy person?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mmm, I figured out the magic part of it. Umm, is it ok that I took a swim?" I stood, completely dry, with only a faint greenish tint to my hair and skin. I stretched like a large cat, feeling joints pop and loosen. "Mmm, we can go now." The just been laid smile refused to leave my face as we walked toward the outer areas of the magic quarter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's no rule against swimming, but most people take one look, or get a whiff of the odor, and run the other way. Some make pretty paterns on the floor with their last meal first."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Odor? It smelled quite wonderful to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Weird," she mummbled, shook her head, and kept walking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
