<p class="pagecaption">Freya - Origins</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It started like any other story, a city of humans attacked by monsters. It was terriblr fighting, viscious upright wolf-like humanoids tore into our ranks with teeth and claws, and battered our weary forces. They died, but it was slow and draining work. Their fur provided extra protection and they could withstand amazing amounts of damage before dropping. We were losing people at the rate of 1 for every two of the beasts we killed, until a truce was reached between King Genn Greymane and Lord Darius Crowley. I was one of those asked to recover a stash of weapons Crowley had hidden in the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The weapons turned the tide and gave us a chance, however, Josiah Avery, the keeper of the weapons, turned into one of the beasts and bit me as I was talking to him. It stung like crazy, even though it wasn't very deep. We fought through the streets, killing massive numbers of the beasts, before taking a stand at the cathedral.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The beasts pounded on us, pushing their way into the cathedral and attacking all in sight. Then they just stopped. The quiet was deafening after the growls and snarls of the assaults. Someone started to say something when unimaginable pain wracked through me. Screams bubbled from my throat before darkness overcame me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dark dreams of killing, running, and tearing wild beasts with my teeth played over and over until I awoke. My back burned with pain, my wrists were raw and chafed, and I couldn't straighten up. As my surroundings came into focus, I saw I was in stocks, in a compound with many of the beasts locked in other stocks. I looked at my hands and saw fur.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lord Godfrey was speaking as he came closer, but all I heard was, "They've kept you alive because they still believe you can be saved. To which I must ask... Is there even a shred of humanity left within you? Perhaps... we will find out, soon enough..." as he poured foul tasting fluid on my tongue. Reflex had me swallow it before I could even think about it. It hit my belly hard, causing cramps and dry heaves. My vision blurred as Godfrey unlocked the stocks and let me fall to the ground.</p>
