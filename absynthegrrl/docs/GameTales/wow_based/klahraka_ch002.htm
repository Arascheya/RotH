<p class="pagecaption">Klahraka - On the Road</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gornek opened the cell once I was dressed. I walked out into the passage and stripped off the new clothes. "As you rid yourselves of me, so I rid myself of you." After a few very shaky breaths I stepped into the sunlight and into the gazes of my clan. Some looked away in shame from my nakedness, others just stared.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My clan," Gornek pronounced. "Klahraka is leaving us today, a proud warrior of the clan." I started to object until he hissed in my ear, "Shut up. I'm doing this for your family, not you." He continued to the crowd, "She goes with honor into the world to represent our clan and our break from the Scourge. May her life be long and bring honor to herself and the clan." My mother cheered through her tears and it prompted a ragged showing from some of the others. Few were sad to see me go and I was long past ready myself. I walked through the crowd, down the road to the gates, and into the world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My feet started to turn right toward Sen'jin and Zroteyla when I left the village. I stopped myself, not wanting to explain what had happened and why I was leaving. She might have understood, but she would have wanted to come with me and the life I was heading toward wouldn't be for her. By leaving I was freeing her to settle down and have a future with her family and friends.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I turned left and headed north, toward Razor Hill. My heart started to beat faster with excitement at the thought of new places, sights, and people. </p>
