<p class="pagecaption">Zroteyla - Origins</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was born the second child, of three, to the troll chief Vol'jin and his mate Vanira. When the shattering happened and the land changed, a new Horde warchief was selected. Some of his policies were not to my father's liking and he led our people to the Echo Isles, where we rebuilt the ruins into our new villages. I loved the airy huts and palm shaded village, but missed the orc children I had grown up with.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Father assigne grandfather, Canaga Earthcaller, to be a liason to the orc village. I would often go with him to see my friends. There was one in particular, Klahraka, an orc girl of my age, that I missed most. She was an odd one, quiet, a bit cold, but more adventurous than the others. We would sneak out, into the rough areas around the orc village, and spy on the other residents. Klahra was much better at it than I was. If we had to run, it would be because I had been spotted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Klahra intoduced me to the potent orc brews. She'd swipe water bags of it from the barrels placed in the caves for aging and we'd drink until we couldn't stand. I introduced her to the ganj. I liked the burn of the brews, but ganj was much better. I wouldn't wake up with the nasty, parched, headachy feeling of a hangover after indulging in ganj. The best was grown on Bloodtalon Isle, where the raptors were bred. The combination of raptor droppings and warm, sandy soil gave it the best properties.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I don't remember when I first started to notice the boys. It seemed like one day they were disgusting and the next they were curiously different. I found myself staying by windows where couples were making out and looking at the man-parts, wondering what it would feel like to have one inside me. Klahra found the thought disgusting. It would have bothered me more if I hadn't been wondering what it would be like to taste another woman as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One night, when we were fourteen, we were watching Klahra's parents in one of the back caves. As her mom started to howl, it became too much for me. I grabbed Klahra and planted a heavy, passionate kiss on her. I expected her to pull away, istead, she pressed against me, then grabbed my arm and dragged me to her cave. We spent the rest of the night learning how to love each other.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Over the years I grew to love her, but I don't think she ever loved me. I was a convenient fuck-toy and someone to do things with, but she was always restless. One day, shortly after my seventeenth birthing day, she was gone. She hadn't shown up for my party, which had never happened before, and, when I went to her village, no one would talk about her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Klahra's mom came to see me the next day, finding me helping Tegashi and Kijara tend the young raptors and the ganj plants. She stood for a long time before she spoke quietly, "I never told you this, ok?" I nodded. "Klahra was, was exiled. I know you were with her on some of her less extreme doings. Did she ever tell you about the other things she did?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, mon, she told me noting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She wasn't just a peeper. She stole things and, and she, she killed people, our people, for the head man of the village. He was afraid of her because she liked it too much. At least that's what he said."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could see dat. She had a cold side. Do ya know where she went? I miss dat girl, even wi' da cold."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had hoped she'd come to you. She liked you, you know. She must have gone to Razor Hill instead. From there, I'm not sure I could even guess, maybe Orgrimmar, maybe into the Northern Barrens. If you see her, could you tell her I miss her? Ask her to send word that she's ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could do dat. It be close to da end a my trainin', mebe, when data be done, I go ta find her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, Zroteyla. You're the best friend my daughter had," she gave me a tight hug and turned to go. "Stop and see Huklah and I any time. We've missed you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">I walked back into Klahraka's village, after my first solo hunt, covered in scratches and bites. Once I presented the scorpid tail stinger to my older sister and hunting trainer, Sen'jin, Klahra ran up. I had met Klahra earlier in the summer, when her parents had come to see my father, the headman of my village. We had talked, well I had talked, while our parents discussed village matters. We continued to hang out since I had been coming to her village for training.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Klahra hurried me to her cave and asked me to tell her all about the hunt, asking for details when I tried to skip over them. Retelling it brought the excitement and tension of the hunt back again. At the end of my story, I grabbed her and kissed her, then backed away in shock. "Uh, I'm sorry, I don't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She grabbed my head, pulled it to her, and kissed me passionately. "I've wanted to do that since we met!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">I would have lived out my life in my home village of Sen'jin if I hadn't met Klahraka when I was fourteen. Her family had come to talk with Master Gadrin, my father, and I was asked to show her around while they talked. I found her intriguing and tried to get her talking about herself. Instead, I ended up telling her a lot about me, my family, and the rest of my village. By the end of the afternoon we were friends.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We would visit each other as the summer grew warmer. Most of the time I was going to her village with my older sister, Jen'shan, hunting trainer. She was training some of us for our rites of passage. I had hoped she would be a bit easier with me, her kid sister, but she was harder, wanting to avoid claims of favoritism.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Klahra and I would hang out after I was finished with training, talking about whatever came to mind. Some things hadn't changed, I was doing most of the talking while she listened. It didn't matter how hard I tried to get her to talk she would turn it back to me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mid summer was my first solo hunt. Sen'jin sent me out to bring back a tail from one of the scorpids roaming the areas outside Klahra's village. Finding my prey was easy, killing it was much harder. Its claws were everywhere, swiping at my face and arms, while the tail stinger snapped past my face and chest. Once it grazed my arm with shooting pain and dizziness from the venom. By the time it was dead, I was covered in small bites and scratches.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* switch to Zro as primary thread instead of Klahra - spice it up and consider submitting to Stories once it is more complete */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the middle of summer we were lovers. I was her lover, I think I was her fuck buddy. She had a curious coldness about herself that I never was able to thaw all the way through. She didn't like herself very much. She wasn't self conscious, like some of the troll girls of my village, but she made no effort to look good. And she ranted about everything in her home, the boys, the men, the way things worked, everything. Sometimes it was charming and sometimes it was annoying, but it didn't stop me loving her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were together until our seventeenth year. Something happened in her village, bringing the death of an entire family. Afterwards, she disappeared. Her family didn't know where she went, other than to say she left. Gornek, the orc village headman, wouldn't say anything, although there was relief in his voice when he said she was gone. Stories came out that Klahra was a thief and there were hints she was more than that. I knew she was a sneaky person because she had shown me some things while we were together, but the other rumors worried me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For weeks after her departure I fretted and struggled with myself. In the end I started out to follow her. The trail was old, however, Ukor remembered a naked orc heading toward Razor Hill about the time Klahra disappeared. Grosk, the innkeeper in Razor Hill remembered a naked orc coming in as well. She had kept to herself, getting a message from someone, and drinking in the back. Mid afternoon a blood elf had come in, talked with her, and they left together. He had overheard talk of going to Orgrimmar and the zeppelin towers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I followed the trail as far as the zeppelin towers outside Orgrimmar, but last the trail there. No one remembered which zeppelin they had gotten on. Apparently the site of a naked orc and a naked blood elf wasn't that memorable. With no more trail, I returned home and through myself into the problems of my village and around Razor Hill, trying to move on. Sometimes I would see another orc girl who looked just like her, but it never was her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Zro is usually not afraid, however, the ramps and bridges of Thunder Bluff scare the crap out of her. They're steep, slippery, and wind swept. She's completely baffled by the ease with which the Tauren navigate them */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Zro is sex positive and likes it rough */</p>
