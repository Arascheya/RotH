<h1 align="center">Koriana: chapter-1</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">My name is Koriana and I am the
youngest from a family of three.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
brother, Terrel, is six years older than I am and Jannel, my sister, is one year
older. We lived in a village several days ride from Provlan, in the West
Kingdom. I don't remember much about it except life was not easy but most
everyone seemed happy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We were well
off but mom tried to make sure we didn't take it for granted.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I would probably be there still if
my mom hadn't died when I was eight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At
the time I thought it was just a bad case of dysentery but with what I've
learned working at Thomas and Magnusson I'm not so sure any more.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">After my mom's death father was
off in the city more often than he was at home. We spent our time with Philip
and Marya, one of the neighbors, and their kids. They agreed to watch over us as
a favor to the memory of my mom. We were three additional mouths they had to
feed, but I never heard them complain. Philip was always busy around town,
mending this, or fixing that while Marya would make simple herb preparations and
do sewing. We ran wild through the town with their brood, returning to eat and
sleep. In many ways the entire village became our family, watching over the herd
of us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I've always been more curious than
is healthy, so when I found a locked door open I was through it immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was midway through the room, examining a suit of armor that told me
stout, staid Marya hadn't always been so dull, when Philip leapt through the
door brandishing sword and dagger. When he saw me jerk up, trip over a rug and
crash back in a heap, with the armor on top, he burst out laughing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Finally he slid down the wall to sit on the floor, still laughing, and
motioned for me to come closer. Warily I slipped closer and squatted just out of
reach. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&quot;The look on your face
was priceless! You know, Koriana, if you are going to snoop into things the very
least you should do is close the door behind you.&quot; After a few more
chuckles he continued,&quot; Now, just out of curiosity, what did you see and
what has it told you?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I never did get the ass chewing I
expected. Instead he just complimented me on my one observation then used each
item to detail his background. He had been a sleuth assigned to investigate a
particularly brilliant theft. During his investigations he met and fell in love
with Marya. As his investigations progressed he linked two other crimes to the
thief he was tracking. After three years he finally tracked the thefts to Marya.
He confronted her one night and offered her an alternative. She could leave the
city with him and he wouldn't turn her in. Apparently the arrangement was
agreeable since they have been here ever since.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Then he gave me some of the best
advice I have ever gotten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Always
look beneath the surface, look for the hidden agenda, the real reasons for an
action. For example, Marya didn't need the things she stole, she needed the
challenge of the theft, as I needed the challenge of the hunt. Your father, now
there's something more going on there, too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When he first arrived and started courting your mom parts of his story
never seemed quite right. Keep your eyes open but I wouldn't let him catch you
at it.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I was to remember those warnings
well when father arrived home after my 10th birthday and introduced Rachel, his
new wife. She seemed to be good for father, he was more interested in us than he
had been since my mom's death. She seemed very friendly and warm, yet every so
often I would catch her looking at Jannel or Terrel with a very calculating
look. When I'd mention this to the others, they would just say I was imagining
things. Once, I mentioned this to Philip. His only comment was to keep my eyes
open and trust my feelings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Three weeks after father's arrival
I couldn't sleep and was headed out for a midnight walk. As I passed his door I
heard voices and, being curious, stopped to listen. At first they were talking
of finally being together and how all the obstacles were gone between them. I
thought I had misjudged Rachel until I heard, &quot;Besides that cow you married
gave you three fine bargaining chips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
old regime is gone and as you can see, no one remembers anyway.&quot; Confused,
I continued to listen, only to hear father reply, &quot;Well at least something
good may have come from hiding in this hell hole with those squalling
brats.&quot; Father's words left me strangely frightened. Mind whirling I
continued out into the moonlight. I wandered a long time, until the chill of the
night began to overcome the chill of the words. When I finally stopped to look I
had wandered into the woods beyond Therese and Samantha's hut. When I turned to
start back I saw a small clearing brilliantly lit by the moon. Something drew me
into it and I started randomly moving, trying to get my body to copy movements I
felt I needed to do. For a brief instant I thought I heard a faint chanting
coming from all around. It only lasted a moment but left me calm and warm.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The next thing I remember was
waking up to bright sunlight and the sounds of Jannel getting dressed. The
feelings of peace and calm lasted into the morning and even cushioned the
resurgence of fear when father announced we were moving to the city.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The journey to the city was a
torment. We were dressed in &quot;proper&quot; uncomfortable things and packed
into a carriage for the journey. Rachel continuously told us how we would have
to act and who to associate with once we got to Provlan. Our meals were passed
in to us as was the chamber pot. When I wanted to get out for some air I was
lectured on the evils of caravans and the dangerous men that ran them. Either
Rachel or father was constantly in attendance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The second night I managed to slip
out while father slept. Keeping to the shadows I slipped close to the main fire
and listened to the caravaners talk, laugh, and sing. As my gaze traveled over
the group it came to rest on a thin, scarred woman seated near the fire, very
close to where I was hiding. She was laughing and joking with the rest of them,
unconcerned by the crude comments and rude banter of the crew. She was dressed
in leather armor and wore a large sword strapped to her back. Fascinated, I
stared at her, trying to decide if I should talk with her when Rachel grabbed me
from behind. &quot;What are you doing out here? Don't you know you could be
raped or killed? Now come on before there's trouble.&quot; As she dragged me
away the woman spun and looked straight at us. When Rachel's gaze was turned she
smiled and nodded at me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The city was even worse. We
couldn't just wander around or talk with just any one. Every other word from
Rachel was what will people think, what sort of impression will you make. We had
many sets of clothes and constant instruction on how to pick the right ones for
the occasion. In no time at all my head was spinning from all of it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Two weeks after arrival when
Rachel announced it was time to correct our lack of religious training, father
agreed. The very next holy day we were dressed in fine new clothes and taken to
the temple of Rachel's god.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
an imposing granite edifice looming over everything near it. Inside it was dark
and damp, lit only infrequently with torches. Everywhere was a feeling of weight
pressing down, crushing the light, resting heavily on your shoulders. The main
chamber was an echoing cavern shrouded in shadow, with the altar and statues
absorbing the light around them. As the service began and the chanting built the
shadows thickened, seeping out of the walls and flowing over the worshippers. As
the priests added their voices feathery wisps of darkness drifted into my
thoughts, like thick fog through the trees. As the chants built the fog
thickened and solidified, seeping deeper into my thoughts, suffocating me. When
I began to twitch and shiver father elbowed me hard and told me to stop fighting
it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Thicker and deeper grew the
darkness until I was trapped in a shrinking patch of self. Suddenly I remembered
the moonlight and the clearing. Concentrating on it with all my strength, I
willed myself to remember. Slowly, very slowly the darkness oozed back,
reluctantly withdrawing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">By the end of the ceremony I was
so weak I could barely walk to our carriage. Jannel and Terrel had ecstatic
looks on their faces, father looked relaxed, and Rachel looked like a sated
predatory bird.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Next holy day I ran and hid,
refusing to go back to that temple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
everyone got back I was beaten and locked in a storeroom for three days. At the
end of this time father came and explained how he feared for my soul and how
because he &quot;loved me&quot; he wanted me to go with him and see one of the
priests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I refused, was beaten
again, and left in the room another two days.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The next time father just came in and bodily escorted me to
the temple.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The priest looked at me and began
to chant. Darkness flowed from his hands and closed over my head, pressing
inward. The pressure built as his chanting intensified until I was clutching my
head. Bands of pain crushed in, as oblivion closed over me, I heard screaming. I
came to face down on the floor with the priest telling father I was a creature
of hell and could not be saved. He further counseled abandoning me to the
temple. Father said he could not do that to one of his daughters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He dragged me, weak and shaking, to our carriage and took me home.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">After that I was given the choice
of being locked in the storeroom or going with them whenever they went to the
temple. Even when Jannel and Terrel started telling me how wonderful the new
religion was, I wouldn't even consider going with them. Even now the thought of
that place starts the shakes again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
I was 13 Terrel was married off to an older woman of a politically advantageous
family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It actually turned into a
good match. They were compatible and grew to love one another.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Terrel took to the life of a young
lord like a duck to water. Jannel was less enthusiastic but loved the fancy
clothes and attention she got at parties. As we grew Jannel blossomed into a
truly stunning woman. She was always quiet and demure with just the right amount
of shyness to spark anyone's interest. Me, well I couldn't get used to the fact
when I was asked what I thought no one really wanted to know. I never got much
in the way of looks either, as Rachel was always fond of reminding me, often
with &quot;Don't worry Anna, we'll find you someone, even if you aren't much to
look at.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Jan developed an interest in boys
early on and took to pointing out the really interesting ones to me. I often
found myself looking more at the woman with the guy, than at the guy himself.
&quot;If you weren't my sister I'd think you were gay or something. How can you
have such little interest in guys?&quot; I couldn't answer her, I couldn't even
answer myself, I just knew at best guys only sparked a passing interest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">We had dance and language lessons
daily. The courtly dances we were supposed to learn came easily but they weren't
enough, it seemed there had to be more. I kept pressing Isandra, our tutor,
until she showed me some performance dance moves. At that point I was hooked, I
kept pressuring her even more until she would take a few minutes each lesson and
teach me exercises and performance movements while Jan and Terrel practiced the
other dances. The discipline required forced me to concentrate on what I was
doing and allowed me to forget home life for a while. I practiced every chance I
could. Finally there was something I could do just for me. I couldn't wait to
find time to lose myself in practice, just letting go and moving, not thinking,
just being. Jan noticed almost at once that I was more relaxed and happy. After
a few weeks Isandra told me I could be good if I continued to work hard. She
wanted to increase the amount of time I spent but Rachel would not hear of it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I begged and pleaded with Isandra
until she agreed to teach me at her place, if I could get there. I managed to
slip away three nights a week for several months until Rachel found out and then
there was an incredible fight. She considered all dancers to be sluts and would
not allow me to bring that shame onto father. I would not back down, there was
no way I could stop dancing. Once more there was a round of beatings. From then
on she changed tutors routinely, all dance classes were monitored, and my room
was watched. I continued to dance whenever I could, mostly when I was sentenced
to the storeroom, or at parties, out in the gardens, where Rachel wouldn't find
me. When I was dancing I could forget about her and father.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">There were also lessons in history
and art. The history was fascinating but the tutor only gave out bits and pieces
of things. It wasn't until we started asking questions that he came into his own
and started linking the little bits together. When Rachel found out she was
furious. She immediately started in again about inappropriate behavior and I
blew up. &quot;What the hell is going on? How are we ever supposed to learn
anything?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;All you need to know is how
to enhance your husband's position, and how to care for his children. No man
wants a woman who is smarter than he is.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">At her words the image of the thin
woman, laughing with the caravaners as an equal, popped into my mind. I knew I
couldn't live like Rachel wanted. Scared and angry I screamed back,&quot; What
if I don't want a husband? What if I want to do something meaningful with my
life? I don't want to be tied to a man. I don't want any man to fucking touch
me!&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;Get out you hell bitch! Is
this how you repay your father, after all he's done for you? I swear the slut
that spawned you must have been fucking demons. You can't be your father's
daughter.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">With a strangled cry of rage I
leapt at her. As we fell in a struggling heap I heard Jan yelling for father.
Scrambling and rolling my hands closed around her throat as she clawed at my
face. When father and two others arrived to pull us apart, Rachel was turning
blue. &quot;Put Anna in the storeroom, I'll deal with her later.&quot; Then he
turned to Rachel as I was dragged from the room, still shaking with rage, past
Jan where she stood white faced and tear streaked in the hallway. Her refusal to
look at me hurt far more than anything Rachel had said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">In the storeroom I went through
several dance exercises trying to calm myself. I had just gotten control of my
breathing when father came in. Soundlessly knocked me back onto the cot, and
beat me until I almost passed out. Still without a word he turned and left.
Several hours later he came back and repeated the beating, still without
speaking a word.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">As I was drifting into sleep Jan
came in and sat down on the cot. &quot;Why do you have to fight with her all the
time? I hate what all this does to you. Annie, can't you stop pushing them,
it’s not that bad, really.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;I can't take it, all this
talk of subservience, do what's expected. There has to be more than that. Don't
you see? I want to be accepted as I am, not as a piece of art. I'm not ready for
marriage and babies. I don't even know if it's what I want.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;What you want? Do you really
think they'd let you have what you want, even if you knew what it was? Wouldn't
it be easier if you could compromise your wants a little. I know you admired
Therese and her weapon and outdoor skills, but you are from a higher station
than her, you have obligations.&quot; She sounded just like Rachel. All I could
do was sit and stare until she finally wound down.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">It was all I could do not to
scream at her as I said, &quot;I can't, not yet.&quot; Her tears burned like
acid as she got up and left. Hurt and angry, tears running down my cheeks, I
pounded the cot until my hands were raw from the rough cloth of the blanket.
Finally I drifted into troubled sleep.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The next morning father came back
again. In a cold, emotionless voice he told me, &quot;You are living here as a
daughter of mine. As long as this continues you will obey Rachel and give her
the honor she deserves. If you do not I will turn you over to the temple as the
hell creature you are. You will reside in this room for one week, to think on
your sins. If, after that time, you run away from this house, I will have the
watch find you and take you to the temple.&quot; With that he turned and left.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Think I did, mostly about what
would happen to me at the temple. I decided I would do everything I could to
keep Rachel happy. I made sure from then on that she never saw me dancing, that
I was always very polite to her, even when she would call me hell bitch. It was
harder to force myself not to rise to her baiting comments about my mom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">At 15 I met a noble boy, named
Landron, whom I really liked. He seemed interested in me. He asked what I
thought about things and listened with interest. He made me feel pretty with his
compliments and attention. We saw each other at many of the parties we had to go
to. He would always seek me out and spend most of the party with me. It was fun
to watch Rachel try and introduce the latest eligible boy when Landron was
nearby.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">After seeing each other for
several weeks he talked me into slipping off, into the far reaches of the
garden, during the one of the parties we attended together. The sex left me
unfulfilled, though it seemed like he was trying to make it good for me, but
didn't know how. His attention made me feel much better than the sex had.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>A few weeks later, as I was waiting for sleep, Jan asked,
&quot; So, do you have sex with Landron? How is it?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;It's nice...&quot; I replied
hesitantly, reluctant to tell her it was frustrating.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;Nice?? According to
Meredith, sex is the ultimate joy.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;What do you mean according
to Meredith? Maybe you should judge for yourself.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;Oh no, I couldn't, it
wouldn't be right. Actually, I don't think you really should either, but since
you have, well...I'm curious...&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;I don't know, it seems like
it should be better, but just as I start feeling really good, its over. What's
more important is his interest and caring for me, for what I am.&quot; I waited
for a while but no other questions came. After much thought I asked, &quot;Jan,
what do you think of when you see another woman?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;Oh, I don't know. I guess I
wonder if she has a boyfriend, or if she is on the prowl. Why? Is that what you
mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">After long moments I said, kind of
in a rush, &quot;No, I mean do you ever wonder what it would feel like to have
her caressing you, like your boyfriend does? Wonder what she would look like
undressed? How it would feel to hug and kiss her?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;Of course not, that's sick.
How could you even think such things?&quot; My face was burning as I turned
toward the wall, stung by her revulsion. &quot;I think you ought to see one of
the priests, ask him how to deal with these thoughts.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;A priest?&quot; I hissed,
the venom in my voice surprised even me. &quot;What would one of them know about
this? No, I will not go anywhere near that place.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;I wish you would come to the
temple, I really worry about you. You'll spend eternity in torment for what
you're rejecting now. Please?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The pleading in her voice tore at
me, but still I could not agree to go to that vile temple again. In a soft, hurt
voice I answered,&quot; I'm sorry Jan, I can't do it. Please forget I ever asked
these things. I'm sorry, lets just go to sleep and forget it, ok?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">At a party, a month later, I was
sitting in one of the gardens trying to avoid Rachel until Landron showed up
when I heard a group of guys approaching. I wasn't paying much attention until I
heard Landron saying, &quot;You want some? Hit on Jannel's sister, Annie.
Compliment her on her looks and she'll do anything you want.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;I thought you liked her,
Landron.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;Not really, I wanted to see
what it would take to break through her shell. She's always good for some and ok
in bed; but, she thinks and talks too much&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I sat there for a long time, numb
and hurting. Rachel found me much later, dancing in a far part of the garden. At
home it was storeroom time once more, but I was still so numb I didn't even feel
the beating.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I danced until I dropped but even
then I awoke twice during the night, the sound of Landron's laughter searing
through my memory. I wanted to humiliate him, hurt him in front of his friends.
At first I thought maybe I could best him at something, but then I couldn't
think of anything I did that they would consider important. I had to find out
more about what was important to his friends.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The next evening I donned the most
nondescript things I owned and slipped out to try and watch his house. Shortly
before dark four of his friends came by and they headed towards the Other's
Quarter. I was trying to stay close and unobserved when I felt a pressure on my
right side as a slurred male voice hissed, &quot;Ok slut, into the alley and
don't make a sound, or I'll cut you bad.&quot; Something snapped inside,
suddenly I was watching my body from a far distance as it stamped down hard on
his foot, pirouetted left and rammed a knee into his crotch. My hands reached
out, grabbed his head and slammed it into an upraised knee. As he collapsed I
staggered back to the far wall, gasping. Searing pain flashed through my side,
snapping me back into my body. I grabbed for the wound as I heard clapping,
followed by a sarcastic female voice, &quot;Bravo. Not bad for a noble bitch. We
don't see many of your type out slumming. What's wrong, your boyfriend so boring
you came here to find a man?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">She must have seen my flinch at
her question, for a moment she stopped talking. Not sure what she would do next
I pulled out my small dagger and remained against the wall. &quot;Oh come on, if
I'd wanted to take you, you wouldn't have heard me coming.&quot; As she moved
closer she must have seen the blood oozing between my fingers. For a moment I
heard actual compassion in her voice as she said, &quot;Looks like he tagged you
before you killed him. Where did you learn to do that anyway?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Reaction was setting in and my
voice shook as I told her I didn't know. I didn't believe I had killed him until
she rolled him over and showed me. I heard her laughing derisively as I puked my
guts out. Suddenly she stiffened, listened, grabbed my arm, and started to drag
me down the alley. &quot;Quickly before the watch gets here. Now try to walk
like I do, not like an arrogant bitch.&quot; Stomach still churning, I allowed
her to lead me down the alley. Finally she came to a door she seemed happy with
and we entered a dimly lit kitchen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The kitchen belonged to the Fox
and Goose, an average sort of inn, catering mostly to adventurers and travelers.
She had come to know the cook and sometimes helped out for an occasional meal.
She took great delight in pointing out everything I had done wrong coming down
this way, while we examined my side. The blade had skidded along a rib, leaving
a nasty looking cut, but it had already started to clot. It looked like it would
stay closed as long as I was careful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Alright,
so I don't know what the hell I'm doing. Either tell me how to do better or lay
off.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;Bitchy tonight, aren't we?
Want me to walk out and leave you here?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;What, a noble bitch
apologizing? I thought you couldn't do that. Why would one of you high borns
come here anyway? Seems like you have it made where you're at.&quot; Her mockery
was like a slap.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;Yeah, I guess you're right,
I do have it made. Any time I'm beaten father makes absolutely sure there are no
marks or permanent damage.&quot; I had her attention then. &quot;I don't need to
fear rape, all the noble boys treat me so well. They seduce with flattering
words, flowery phrases, and compliments until we willingly follow them to a
secluded spot. Unfortunately they're usually not very satisfying. Later they
tell their friends how easy it is to get some, just compliment her and she'll do
anything. She's not very good, but she's willing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Then of course there are parties.
You could spend your whole life just going from party to party. They're lots of
fun, even when you see families arranging to buy and sell their children for
political advantage. It’s always a matter of being seen only at the correct
events.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I still have two parents, a father
and a step-mother, both of whom are very concerned about my health. It doesn't
really matter that father disapproves of everything I do, and step-mother calls
me hell bitch to my face. They still take care of me. I'm sure it’s more than
damaged goods don't buy good alliances.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Yeah, I guess you're right, I
truly didn't realize how good I have it.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I could see I had shocked her, but
I couldn't enjoy it, the pain was suddenly too real again. I hadn't even
realized I had gotten up and started dance drills until she yelled, &quot;What
the hell are you doing? You'll tear open your side again.&quot; As she said it,
I felt a tearing pain and collapsed into the nearest chair, grabbing at the
wound. “So, you are a dancer,” she continued, awe tingeing her voice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;Of course not, nobles are
never dancers. It would allow us to be too ordinary.&quot; I couldn't keep the
bitterness and anger out of my voice and was immediately sorry as I saw her
recoil. &quot;I'm sorry, no I'm not really, it’s just something I do to feel
better.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;I always wanted to be a
dancer, but I messed up my knees in a fall, when I was young, now it’s all I
can do to run and climb.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Her name was Megan and we spent
the better part of the night talking in that kitchen. I told her about Landron
and coming to the city. She told me how she had survived until she became an
accomplished thief. I wanted to know how to move unnoticed in the city, she
wanted to know about the noble quarter. It was she who suggested I arrange for
Landron to be seen in bed with a non-human by his friends. The more I thought
about it, the more it appealed. Finally we struck a deal, she would teach me and
I'd scope out the noble quarter for her. Part of my training would be helping on
the simpler heists. She would help me watch Landron's movements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">As she guided me back to the edge
of the noble quarter I watched her move. Her knees were stiff but the rest of
her moved well. I almost offered to teach her the little bit of dance that I
knew, but stopped not knowing how she would take the offer. We agreed to meet
again in two days.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The next night was a required
party at the Christatos family country mansion. For the first half of the
evening I &quot;accidentally&quot; avoided Landron. As I dodged around I quickly
was caught up in the challenge of locating valuables and observing how they were
protected. Soon it became quite a game.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Even though I had decided to act
as if I hadn't overheard Landron, it was all I could do not to flinch when he
finally found me and slipped an arm around my waist. When he hit square on my
wounded side, I claimed cramps. I managed to beg off sex by claiming it was my
bleeding time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">After a week of practice I was
able to move around the Other's Quarter without attracting attention. Megan then
began to teach me some of the basic sneaky stuff. As I watched her demonstrate
moving quietly or climbing I would often find I was watching her move, not
watching what she was doing. The third time she caught me at it I told her I
would teach her what I knew about dance. She forgot what she had been saying and
hugged me for joy. At her touch a wave of raw lust surged through me. As I
reached up to stroke her head I remembered Jan's revulsion and quickly turned
the motion into a gesture towards the center of the room. &quot;Why don't I
teach you some now, then we can continue the other lesson.&quot; I used the
movements of the first exercises to channel away my desire and confusion.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">That day Rachel caught sight of me
returning from the Other's Quarter in my shabby clothes. &quot;You hell bitch,
why is everything you do designed to bring disgrace on this family? Now you're
out slumming, oh how I wish we could afford to sell you to the slavers.&quot;
When father arrived home it was storeroom time once again. The stay was for
three days.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">As I was waiting for sleep I
couldn't stop thinking about my reactions to Megan. The feelings didn't seem
wrong, yet I remembered all the comments I'd heard about how twisted and
perverted those people were. Then there was Jan's reaction and the story Landron
told about the gay noble boy and how much fun it was to beat up and torment him.
Yet in the village Therese and Samantha had gone around holding hands or arm in
arm. Nobody ever had anything unkind to say about them, except father. He always
muttered about perversions or said they couldn't find a man. I still couldn't
see where it was wrong, no one was hurt by it, except maybe an ego or two.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The next night I was supposed to
meet Megan for our first job. Just getting out of the storeroom and the house
was a good test my new skills. Our first target was the house of a minor family
allied with the Poriskel family. Their security was very poor and we were in,
had our target, and were out within a very short time. We headed down to the Fox
and Goose to celebrate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">At the Goose Megan brokered our
items with one of her contacts there. After concluding business we grabbed a
couple of drinks and headed for a quiet table. When I was mid way through my
stout Landron and his friends came in and ordered a round. When I pointed him
out to Megan she stared and said, &quot;You sure know how to pick a winner don't
you?&quot; She explained his habit of picking fights with non-locals, then
summoning the watch if things got out of hand. As she concluded her explanation
Landron grabbed a barmaid and headed for the stairs. Furious, I started to my
feet, only to be stopped by Megan, a look of cold fury etched on her face.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">After Landron had been gone about
an hour the others got up and headed for the stairs. Curious, I insisted we stay
until they returned. Megan tried to persuade me to leave but I would have none
of it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Two hours later they all came back
down and ordered another round. They left after they finished it. At that time
Megan silently lead me upstairs, her entire attitude screamed anger and
loathing. We went to a room where the barmaid lay, curled up on a large bed,
battered, bloody, and crying hysterically.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The next thing I knew I had the barman dragged half way across the bar
and was watching him through a red haze as he stammered out the owner was not
there. The fog began to thin as I continued to question him. He finally revealed
the owner lived in the Noble Quarter and hired a manager for this place. He did
not know who the actual owner was and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
manager would not be in until late the next afternoon.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The next day I went to see the manager but got nothing. He
was sure his noble outranked my family, leaving me with nothing to threaten
with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Frustrated and angry I began
tracking ownership through the city bureaucracy. I had no idea how to begin so
the search took almost a week. By the end I had a better idea how the whole mess
worked, gods it was screwy, but I had found what I had suspected, Landron was
the owner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Several nights later Megan and I were once again at the Goose after
another successful heist. Landron and his friends arrived shortly after us and
immediately picked a fight with a half orc adventurer sitting near the bar. The
poor guy tried to avoid it but was unable to get them to back off. The expected
result followed with the watch leading the fellow away.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Next day I headed to the garrison and bluffed my way in to see the half
orc, whose name was Kelecht. I paid the assessed fine from my spoils and asked
him how far he would be willing to go to get his own back. When he looked
hesitant I told him to think about it. I promised to find him at his rooming
house in two days to hear his decision.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Dodging Landron at parties was becoming easier, I think he must have
found another gullible girl to follow him around. Rachel was getting harder to
dodge at night though. Megan and I arranged to take a week off while I tried to
ally Rachel's curiosity. We arranged to meet at Kelecht's rooming house.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We arrived late the day we had agreed on and I presented most of my plan.
At least the part about enticing Landron up to his room, drugging him, and
having his friends find him with a non-human. When I reached that part I
couldn't quite manage to spit out the rest of the plan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After a strained silence, Megan blurted out the part about the victim
being a male non-human. He looked hard at both of us and laughed. &quot;So, you
obviously want me to be the poor sap who is the victim.&quot; Embarrassed
silence greeted his statement. He completely surprised me when he answered in a
cold, icy voice, &quot;Yeah, I'll do it. Not for you, but because I've always
wanted to screw a noble out of his position, and I don't care what it
takes.&quot; He seemed to think a bit more and the continued, &quot;You know if
you could find something to make your friend really horny the effect would be
better for his friends.&quot; Megan and I just stared at him. Then we began to
laugh too.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Through Megan's contacts we found someone who could get us the potion we
needed. All we had to do was snatch a particular item for him. The job was not
easy but we were able to accomplish it after several days planning and
observation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We set the trap the following night, when we were fairly sure Landron
would show up. I was dressed in a pleasure dancer's garb, complete with veil.
Kelecht was sitting at a far table, and Megan had replaced Tirsa, one of the
serving girls. After Landron and his friends had arrived and seated themselves
at their usual table, I waited until I could catch his eye, and motioned him
over. &quot;Buy a poor dancer wine?&quot; I asked, pitching my voice higher than
usual. &quot;Sit a moment, stud?&quot; He sat and motioned for a serving girl,
right on cue Megan headed over. I reached a hand down and ran it along his
thigh. Startled, he ordered the wine I asked for. As Megan turned to go I ran my
hand up higher and whispered, &quot;In a bottle, so we can go someplace
quiet?&quot; He relayed the request. I could see him start to hesitate, unsure
how to handle an aggressive woman. I backed off a little and snuggled closer,
letting him get a whiff of Rachel's perfume. After a few minutes he suggested we
go upstairs and motioned for Megan to bring the wine that way.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the room I told him to lie back, relax, and have some wine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Playing his ego for all it was worth I persuaded him to sit on the bed
and watch as I danced for him. As I began a seductive striptease I watched,
waiting for the drugs to take effect. When he lunged from the bed I flipped the
door open and moved out of the way as Kelecht moved in. Quickly Megan spread out
a duplicate dance costume and swept up Kelecht's robes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We waited a few minutes, then Megan headed down to get Landron's friends.
When they opened the door Kelecht darted out during their stunned silence and
ran for the kitchen. The jeers and derision should have warmed my heart, instead
it spread ice through my blood, rooting me to the spot. Instead of rushing in to
crow my triumph, all I could do was stand and shake. Nothing had been made
better, instead all I had done was further cheapen something. For a moment I
heard the jeers directed at me, driving a flaming stake into my heart. Blinded
by tears and silently sobbing I turned and fled.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>An hour later Megan found me in my favorite spot atop the Far Traveler
Inn, the highest place in the Other's Quarter. &quot;Not like you thought it
would be?&quot; Silently I shook my head. &quot;It seldom is.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Why didn't you tell me?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Would you have believed me if I had?&quot; Again I silently shook
my head. She put an arm around me and held me close. Emotions flared and chased
their way through me, lust, fear, confusion, and others I couldn't even name.
&quot;What's wrong? Please, tell me.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I...I am...I want ... I think...&quot; Confused and shaking I
turned away.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>She reached out and pulled me close again. &quot;You think you're gay,
don't you? And you probably think it's wrong.&quot; Startled, all I could do was
nod, wondering how she knew. As if in answer to that unspoken question she
continued, &quot;I've seen how you watch me. Sadly, I'm not or I could help you
find out right now.&quot; She held me and stroked my hair until I finally
stopped trembling. &quot;You know, even if you are, there are worse things you
could be. You could be like Landron, or your father.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At least you still care.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally I calmed down enough to make my way home. As I slipped into bed
Jan spoke up from the other bed, &quot;Where have you been? If Rachel finds you
slipping out again I don't know what she'll do to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I don't give a shit what that whore does or thinks. She can go to
her hell for all I care.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Annie!&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I'm sorry Jan, I don't feel good right now, I didn't mean to take
it out on you. I'll...I'll tell you about it tomorrow, ok?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The next morning Jan arranged for me to sleep a little later than normal.
When she came to wake me her first words were, &quot;I'm sorry about Landron. I
just heard, it must have been awful, finding out he prefers men, and not even
fully human at that.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Jan, I've got to talk to you...&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Well at least you found out about this before things went too far.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rachel said she had been thinking of arranging for you to marry
him.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Jan...&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;He ought to be glad he's not of our religion, where the penalties
are suitably harsh.&quot; At her words fear grabbed my heart as the blood fled
from my face. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I'm still trying to come to grips with everything.&quot; Her
reaction stopped me, I had hoped to talk to her about how confused I was. I
wanted her to understand and listen. As I sat stunned she continued to babble,
trying, I'm sure, to comfort me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;It must have been awful to remember how he touched you, I would
just die if one of them had touched me. I can see how hard this is on you. I'll
get Rachel to leave you alone today. You just rest.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>She took care of me, like we had each other when we would get sick as
kids. She was still the loving sister I had grown up with, yet now she also
scared me. For once there was something I couldn't talk to her about and I
needed to talk to someone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Jan arranged things so I
could skip the party Rachel had arranged for that evening. Instead I slipped out
and went to the Goose. I was well into my third stout Megan came in. &quot;Kori,
what are you doing here?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What's
wrong?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Oh, everything. I don't know how to cope. My sister thinks I would
feel better if I found another lover, another man. I don't want a man. I don't
want to be a brood mare for some old noble slob either, but that's about all I
have to look forward to. Rachel had already started arranging for me to have
married Landron. I want to do something meaningful, something I can be proud of.
Shit, I don't even like men. I don't know why I got involved with Landron
anyway.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>She sat and listened while I rambled on. Somehow it helped, even though
she didn't even say much. Later, when Tirsa came over to ask if I wanted another
mug of stout, I caught a glimpse of a familiar seeming thin woman at the bar.
She must have felt my stare because she suddenly whirled around and looked
straight at me. Embarrassed, I started to look away, but not before I recognized
the scar on her face. Maybe it was too much stout, I don't know, but before
Tirsa left I told her to take another mug to the woman at the bar and tell her
where it came from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When her mug
arrived she stood, looked at me again, and strode over. &quot;Do I know
you?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I don't think so.&quot; Now that she was here I ran out of words.
She just continued to study me while Megan watched in stunned disbelief. Finally
I found my voice again and began to stammer, &quot;I don't think you'd remember
me, I was only ten. I wanted to talk to you, but before I could my step mother
came and 'rescued' me. You smiled at me then, and I've remembered you ever
since.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;The small noble girl.&quot; She smiled then, &quot;I remember you,
you stood in the shadows for several minutes before that didn't you? What did
you want? Why did you remember?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;It seems so stupid now. I wanted to know how it felt to do what you
were doing. I wanted to sit by that fire and be a part of it.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;So what do you want now?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;The same thing I guess, to know how it feels to be a free woman,
and how you got to be that way.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>She looked hard at me and said, &quot;Ah... yes, to be free, free to
starve where I choose. One day I had had enough, I just left what I was doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If I'd known what I would encounter I don't think I would have had the
courage, but it has never been dull.&quot; With that she launched into a tale of
her first adventure. By the time she was done Megan and I were in stitches.
&quot;So, why are you here? This isn't a nobles place.&quot; I gave a brief
accounting, down playing what we did to Landron. She really laughed when I
mentioned my apprenticeship as a thief. It was a kind laugh, though. When I was
done her look contained admiration. After that she and Megan swapped stories.
She wasn't a bard but she still held us spellbound with her exploits.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Near midnight we finally ran out of steam. We sat in silence for a while
longer and finished another round. Then I headed home, hoping to slip in before
the party ended.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I had just slid into bed when Jan came in. She launched into an excited
description of the party, fortunately she had never come up to find me gone. The
talk of the party had been Landron, of course. He had become the local scandal,
everyone's sympathies went out to me. As I listened the tears started, even
Landron didn't deserve what was being done to him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Several weeks later Megan I were at the Goose again when we overheard
another group of thieves talking. The Dove, the underworld leader, was offering
a reward for information about some items that had been stolen from the
Chariselt manor, a book and gold statuette. Fortunately they were engrossed in
their conversation and didn't see us jerk. The items had been what we purchased
the potion for Landron with. As one we got up and headed for the door, only to
be stopped by a voice from the other table, &quot;Megan, Kori, why don't you
join us? I was just telling the boys here about a reward for information.&quot;
Fearfully we turned and approached, hoping it was dim enough they couldn't see
how pale I had become. Silently we listened as he went over the story again,
concluding with, &quot;If you two hear anything it could make you a nice, tidy
sum, maybe even an audience with the Dove. Then you could get real jobs, not
that shit work you do now.&quot; Sweating, we agreed and hurried away.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would say nothing until we were atop the Far Traveler again.
&quot;Shit, if they trace that to us we're screwed.&quot; We went over
everything about that job, including who had been our contacts. Looking back, we
had contact with only two other people and one of them had been given the items.
After several hours we began to relax, figuring no one would be able to trace
the job to us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I continued to go to the parties, especially since Rachel allowed no
other options. Jan redoubled her efforts to introduce me to 'nice' men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was polite, nothing more. Every so often Jan would look at me strangely
and then I would show enough additional interest to reduce her suspicions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I continued snooping in father's study, trying to find out what his
underlying plan was. What I saw told me very little until shortly before Jan's
wedding. Six months after my 15th birthday Jan was arranged to marry a man well
placed in the circle of advisors to the Christatos family. In return for Jan's
hand and father's continued silence he promised to always consult with father
before giving his advice. I had just started looking for what father was to be
silent about when I heard Rachel and father coming down the hall. Quickly I
darted out the window and scrambled onto the roof. I could hear the murmur of
their voices but could make out nothing. When they finally left again I slid
back into the room and continued looking, but they had removed all the
parchments.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The wedding was one of the most extravagant affairs father had ever put
on. It probably improved his standings slightly, but it nearly bankrupt him. The
match was not good, though. Jan's husband was jealous and possessive. If she so
much as looked at another man there was an argument. She grew haggard and thin.
Once, when I managed to get time alone with her she told me she rarely got out,
and when she did her husband was always watching over her. He insisted on sex
every night but when he was finished he would roll off and go to sleep. Once Jan
tried to ask for her release but he just told her, &quot;You should be happy we
do this. Most people I know don't even bother any more. Besides soon you will be
having sons for me.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Three months later Jan was pregnant. She wasn't happy about it but at
least the nightly torture had stopped. I was rarely allowed to see her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I heard rumors that Jan was 'uppity' and 'difficult' after she had seen
me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A week before my 16th birthday I was once again in father's study,
examining parchments, when I came upon a very old one. It was a writ of exile
for father, with it was a report on an abortive search for co- conspirators. It
seems father and some others had badly fumbled a large play for power. I was
half way through the intricate details when I heard father and Rachel
approaching. Once again it was out and onto the roof. This time they were close
enough for me to hear the conversation. &quot; So, you've finally figured out
what to do with the hell bitch. How will you keep her from causing damage?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I wish you wouldn't call her that, she's still a valuable
bargaining chip, even if you do hate her.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You remember the head of the underworld? Well he has always wanted links
with respectability and he likes red heads, he even asked for Annie by name. I
figure he can find something to keep her tractable.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For a minute the roof started to spin, then I began to shake so hard it
was all I could do not to slide off. For a moment I considered letting myself go
but then I realized I probably wouldn't die, and even if I did I might not be
allowed to stay dead.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Then came another blow, &quot;...will be well looked after. She will have
handmaidens and servants to cater to her every whim. He has even agreed to have
two of them assist her and look after her until the wedding. I think we should
go give her the good news now. The handmaids are waiting downstairs to take up
their duties.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I wish I could say my leaving was carefully planned and thoughtfully
executed, it wasn't. I flat fled in panic. I slid in behind them and while they
headed towards my room I slipped into their room, grabbed anything that looked
valuable, and ran.</p>
