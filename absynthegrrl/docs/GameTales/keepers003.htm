<p class="pagecaption">Chapter 3</p>

<p class="regtxt5">sights and sounds as Sophia awakens - heartbeat of the main power converters, whispering rustle of the cleaning bubbles, warm energy and enfolding of the throne, transparent screens floating in front of her, tyana, sitting crossleggeed, floating in the air behind the screens in front of the throne, watching over her, expanded awareness, the cool stone outside the interface, gregorian chants echoing through the throne room?</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Another image swam up while she dreamed. Once again she was seated in the throne when the skeletal servitors opened the far door. A group of tall, thin, greyish figures walked in. In the center of the group was a tall woman clothed in white with a halo of white light hovering around her face. The woman motioned her escort away and approached the throne alone. "Margla, Dimension Mistress," she said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mistress of Centrys, Defender of the Doors, what brings you here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We must talk my friend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let us move to more comfortable quarters then. Your servitors may wait here." Sophia descended from the throne and exited through a hidden door in one of the giant stone skull to the right and back of the dias. Beyond the door was a small sitting room, dominated by two large, wingback chairs with a small table facing them. The room was gothic in appearance, done in deep reds, blacks, and wrought iron fixtures. Once they both had settled in Sophia said, "Something to drink?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Silver Slyth liquor if you have some? It has been so hard to get since the Arduin plane has become unstable."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It shall be here momentarily," Sophia replied. "It is a pity about that plane, there were so many interesting items there. Perhaps some mad techno or arcane will manage to re-stabilize it in time." For the next few minutes they engaged in meaningless talk until a winged female fiend walked in and set down a tray with two goblets, a cut crystal decanter of silver liquid, a small white porcelain dish, and a silver knife. "I have a couple of bottles of this set aside, if I might gift you one?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ever the gracious hostess, I shall certainly accept your kind gift." The woman in white took the decanter and poured a very small amount of the liquid out into the dish and touched the knife to it. The liquid immediately turned jet black. "Ah, one of the finest varieties I see.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You wound me. I would never serve inferior refreshment to a friend," Sophia answered back, smiling. "Now, what brings you from Centrys?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well..." The woman in white began as the image faded away.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Some time later Sophia returns to wakefullness. She was uncertain of how long she was dreaming, however, she was not stiff. After another long look at the throne and the enormous stone skulls surrounding it, she returned to the library. On the table were the five volumes Koria had retrieved for her. She grabbed the top one, <a href="">Magical Theory</a>, and began reading. Once she was done she continued down the stack, reading in the order the books were placed. Next was <a href="">Gate Theory</a>, then <a href="">Gods, Goddesses and the Rest</a>, then <a href="">Hut Concepts</a>, and finally <a href="">A Quick History of the World</a>. By the time she was finished her head was spinning from the information she had tried to absorb. Some of it mirrored Jaime's game data on the surface, but the details were more complete and detailed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia stood, took hold of the small mallet, and tapped the bell. A rich perfect tone shimmered in the air as Koria materialized next to the table. "Yes, oh most mighty mistress of the hut?" She asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't do that. I'm just Sophia."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes Mistress Sophia. How may I serve you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sophia was about to scream until she saw the amusement in Koria's eyes. "Who is Margla? Who is the woman in white from Centrys?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Margla was the creator of the Hut and the one Irena inherited from. I don't know much about her. Klktzash, the previous librarian, would know more. The woman in white is She Who Must Never Be Named, one of the Greater Powers and the ruler of Centrys. She and Margla were friends."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How can I remeber things I've never known?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The hut stores every detail of the mistress to provide life support and regeneration in case of death. I don't understand the details. Tyana could explain it better than I can. Once you became the mistress, you have access to the memories of the previous owners."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And the memories of the various crew that have been tied to the hut as well," Tyana added as she faded into view."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about current crew?" Koria asked nervously.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is filtered. In rare cases it could be done, but it would have to be an extreme situation and I would have to be convinced it would be the only way to survive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should be able to access Irena's memories then?" Sophia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ordinarily yes, however, the current situation is different enough and she expressly forbade it. Sorry."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
