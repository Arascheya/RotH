<p class="regtxt5">I was raised a Cousland, one of the families of high nobility in Fereldan. From little onward I was saturated with stories of the honor and prestige of my family. The lessons of treating everyone well and making them feel as if they mattered stuck. The lessons on courtly behavior, the expectations of a young lady, and the firm belief in the Maker didn't.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had always been a wild child, learning sword craft with my older brother, climbing trees, hiding in the castle, and learning less than lady-like things from Nan, my nanny and confidant. Mother and father tried to raise me to be a good noble lady, but for every dress they forced me into, I managed to demand more martial training to compensate. Once mother tried to disagree, but I remembered seeing her armor in the chest on her side of the bed. One reminder was all it took for her to laugh and relent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Puberty hit me hard. I knew what the new feelings were from watching the hounds in the kennels, but I wasn't prepared for the raw intensity of them. It didn't take long to figure out how to use my fingers to bring some relief, but the belly tingling excitement I would get from a beautiful woman or a handsome man were harder to deal with.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I grew into a lusty wench. Only the herbal knowledge of Nan kept me from getting myself into serious trouble. She tried desperately to change my wanton ways, but to no avail. I loved sex, be it with boys or girls, and couldn't get enough of it. I had several favorites in the castle, Ser Gilmore, the priestess Mallol, who tried to bring me into the Maker's fold with every orgasm, and one of my mother's serving maids.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nan also taught me how to slip around guards, through locked doors, and how to defend myself with or without weapons. She may have been hard and bitter appearing on the outside, but she was my secret confidant in the dark of the night. She hadn't always been my nanny or our cook. In her youth she had made a name for herself as the Shadow Vixen, a thief of renown in Denerim.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During my training with the soldiers I would overhear their tales of the village girls. They'd change topic as soon as they noticed me, but my training in sneaking let me hear many interesting things. By the time I was seventeen I knew I had to see for myself. My family went into the village often, but I was always on display. To see the underbelly would require disguise and stealth.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once again I enlisted Nan's help. She was horrified, but knew she wouldn't be able to talk me out of my plan. After several weeks of training in the finer art of changing movements, altering voice and speech, and careful application of makeup, she told me I was ready. I slipped into peasant clothes, brushed heavy handfuls of soot through my red Cousland hair, smeared darkener and dirt on my face and prepared to slip out through the escape tunnel from the servant's quarters. Nan grabbed a small rock from a pile of sweepings and motioned toward my ragged shoes. I nodded, pulled the left one off, and thrust the rock into it. It was easier to remember to limp if there was a reminder.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The sun was just setting as I emerged from the escape tunnel. We had practiced escaping this way enough that I knew the path to the village and the path toward Amaranthine. Half way to the village I came upon a small hut that I didn't remember. It looked old and deserted, however, it hadn't been there four months ago when we had last practiced evacuating the castle. I stepped to the half open door, hanging by one leather hinge, and pulled it open. The interior was darker than I expected given how bad the roof looked. A piece of parchment flapped on what might have been a small table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The world tore with a twisting, falling feeling as I stepped through the door and fell forward into blackness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* make her a daughter of the Hut - not by blood, but by assimilation, an instance daughter */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* finds hut in woods between servant's escape tunnel and Highever village */</p>
