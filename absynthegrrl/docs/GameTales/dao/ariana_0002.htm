<p class="regtxt5">I awoke face down on a soft bed, in a sunlit room. Sounds of a fountain drifted softly on a light, cool breeze. A delicate, sweet floral scent filled the air. I was still dressed in my villager clothes, laying on top of a delicate silk quilt. The sun left beautiful patterns on the wood floor, streaming in through carved wooden window screens. The designs were unlike any I had seen in Highever.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Panic tugged at me as I realized I had no idea where I was. There was a single arched doorway out of the room, opening onto a red stone landing with another archway across the narrow passage. Patterned sunlight glinted off a marble counter with a small basin set in it. Two strange golden things poked up from the surface and arched over the basin. A fancy privy, also done in marble crouched on the floor beyond. There were no windows to reveal where the privy dropped to. The top of a set of stairs led down to the left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The floor under my feet was intricately patterned tile, of a richness and quality that rivaled anything in the palaces of Denerim. Thick, richly colored rugs were scattered near the bed and stacks of pillows rested in clusters around it. A large chest rested at the foot of the bed and a dark wood wardrobe was tucked into the left hand corner when facing the archway.</p>
