<p class="pagecaption">Neria</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you pick up anything important from the repository?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, there was nothing among the trinkets sufficiently interesting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then where did you get that, that indecent bit of cloth and metal? Why is my initiate derssed in something similar?" Greagoir demanded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You think we wanted to die down there? First Enchanter, I really hope the guardians were constructs rather than people. We did eliminate quite a few."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But where did you get it? Tell me!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Greagoir, I know you mean well, but back off. Your right to interfere with me has ended. You think demonic possession is the worst thing in the multi-verse? You are quite mistaken. Even this blight it but a burp in the functionings of the whole."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are you and what have you done with Neria?" Irving asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There was something interesting, but it wasn't in the repository. I found a ring in the store rooms. This ring..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irving bent to look, then backed away, face ashen, "That ring was in a warded chest, dropped into the lake. How did you find it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was helping inventory the store romm and found it on the floor. Next thing I remember it was on my finger, I was wearing this, and several hours had passed. The oil in my lantern was nearly gone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Guards..." Greagoir began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Greagoir," Neria spoke in a velvet voice with steel buried within. "You are a good man, but the misguided beliefs of the Chantry won't save you. Not reacting foolishly or in a threatening way is the only way you will survive. First Enchanter, perhaps you'd like to fill him in?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* idea is - what would happen if a daughter of the hut were to step out of the basement into the face of Gregor and Irving - how would she answer their questions? */</p>
