Kings of the Night
Robert E. Howard



Chapter 1

The Caesar lolled on his ivory throne--
His iron legions came
To break a king in a land unknown,
And a race without a name.
   --The Song of Bran

The dagger flashed downward. A sharp cry broke in a gasp. The form
on the rough altar twitched convulsively and lay still. The jagged
flint edge sawed at the crimsoned breast, and thin bony fingers,
ghastly dyed, tore out the still-twitching heart. Under matted white
brows, sharp eyes gleamed with a ferocious intensity.

Besides the slayer, four men stood about the crude pile of stones
that formed the altar of the God of Shadows. One was of medium height,
lithely built, scantily clad, whose black hair was confined by a
narrow iron band in the center of which gleamed a single red jewel. Of
the others, two were dark like the first. But where he was lithe, they
were stocky and misshapen, with knotted limbs, and tangled hair
falling over sloping brows. His face denoted intelligence and
implacable will; theirs merely a beast-like ferocity. The fourth man
had little in common with the rest. Nearly a head taller, though his
hair was black as theirs, his skin was comparatively light and he was
gray-eyed. He eyed the proceedings with little favor.

And, in truth, Cormac of Connacht was little at ease. The Druids
of his own isle of Erin had strange dark rites of worship, but nothing
like this. Dark trees shut in this grim scene, lit by a single torch.
Through the branches moaned an eerie night-wind. Cormac was alone
among men of a strange race and he had just seen the heart of a man
ripped from his still-pulsing body. Now the ancient priest, who looked
scarcely human, was glaring at the throbbing thing. Cormac shuddered,
glancing at him who wore the jewel. Did Bran Mak Morn, king of the
Picts, believe that this white-bearded old butcher could foretell
events by scanning a bleeding human heart? The dark eyes of the king
were inscrutable. There were strange depths to the man that Cormac
could not fathom, nor any other man.

"The portents are good!" exclaimed the priest wildly, speaking
more to the two chieftains than to Bran. "Here from the pulsing heart
of a captive Roman I read--defeat for the arms of Rome! Triumph for
the sons of the heather!"

The two savages murmured beneath their breath, their fierce eyes
smoldering.

"Go and prepare your clans for battle," said the king, and they
lumbered away with the ape-like gait assumed by such stunted giants.
Paying no more heed to the priest who was examining the ghastly ruin
on the altar, Bran beckoned to Cormac. The Gael followed him with
alacrity. Once out of that grim grove, under the starlight, he
breathed more freely. They stood on an eminence, looking out over long
swelling undulations of gently waving heather. Near at hand a few
fires twinkled, their fewness giving scant evidence of the hordes of
tribesmen who lay close by. Beyond these were more fires and beyond
these still more, which last marked the camp of Cormac's own men,
hard-riding, hard-fighting Gaels, who were of that band which was just
beginning to get a foothold on the western coast of Caledonia--the
nucleus of what was later to become the kingdom of Dalriadia. To the
left of these, other fires gleamed.

And far away to the south were more fires--mere pinpoints of
light. But even at that distance the Pictish king and his Celtic ally
could see that these fires were laid out in regular order.

"The fires of the legions," muttered Bran. "The fires that have
lit a path around the world. The men who light those fires have
trampled the races under their iron heels. And now--we of the heather
have our backs at the wall. What will fall on the morrow?"

"Victory for us, says the priest," answered Cormac.

Bran made an impatient gesture. "Moonlight on the ocean. Wind in
the fir tops. Do you think that I put faith in such mummery? Or that I
enjoyed the butchery of a captive legionary? I must hearten my people;
it was for Gron and Bocah that I let old Gonar read the portents. The
warriors will fight better."

"And Gonar?"

Bran laughed. "Gonar is too old to believe--anything. He was high
priest of the Shadows a score of years before I was born. He claims
direct descent from that Gonar who was a wizard in the days of Brule
the Spear-slayer who was the first of my line. No man knows how old he
is--sometimes I think he is the original Gonar himself!"

"At least," said a mocking voice, and Cormac started as a dim
shape appeared at his side, "at least I have learned that in order to
keep the faith and trust of the people, a wise man must appear to be a
fool. I know secrets that would blast even your brain, Bran, should I
speak them. But in order that the people may believe in me, I must
descend to such things as they think proper magic--and prance and yell
and rattle snakeskins, and dabble about in human blood and chicken
livers."

Cormac looked at the ancient with new interest. The semi-madness
of his appearance had vanished. He was no longer the charlatan, the
spell-mumbling shaman. The starlight lent him a dignity which seemed
to increase his very height, so that he stood like a white-bearded
patriarch.

"Bran, your doubt lies there." The lean arm pointed to the fourth
ring of fires.

"Aye," the king nodded gloomily. "Cormac--you know as well as I.
Tomorrow's battle hinges upon that circle of fires. With the chariots
of the Britons and your own Western horsemen, our success would be
certain, but--surely the devil himself is in the heart of every
Northman! You know how I trapped that band--how they swore to fight
for me against Rome! And now that their chief, Rognar, is dead, they
swear that they will be led only by a king of their own race! Else
they will break their vow and go over to the Romans. Without them we
are doomed, for we can not change our former plan."

"Take heart, Bran," said Gonar. "Touch the jewel in your iron
crown. Mayhap it will bring you aid."

Bran laughed bitterly. "Now you talk as the people think. I am no
fool to twist with empty words. What of the gem? It is a strange one,
truth, and has brought me luck ere now. But I need now no jewels, but
the allegiance of three hundred fickle Northmen who are the only
warriors among us who may stand the charge of the legions on foot."

"But the jewel, Bran, the jewel!" persisted Gonar.

"Well, the jewel!" cried Bran impatiently. "It is older than this
world. It was old when Atlantis and Lemuria sank into the sea. It was
given to Brule, the Spear-slayer, first of my line, by the Atlantean
Kull, king of Valusia, in the days when the world was young. But shall
that profit us now?"

"Who knows?" asked the wizard obliquely. "Time and space exist
not. There was no past, and there shall be no future. NOW is all. All
things that ever were, are, or ever will be, transpire _now_. Man is
forever at the center of what we call time and space. I have gone into
yesterday and tomorrow and both were as real as today--which is like
the dreams of ghosts! But let me sleep and talk with Gonar. Mayhap he
shall aid us."

"What means he?" asked Cormac, with a slight twitching of his
shoulders, as the priest strode away in the shadows.

"He has ever said that the first Gonar comes to him in his dreams
and talks with him," answered Bran. "I have seen him perform deeds
that seemed beyond human ken. I know not. I am but an unknown king
with an iron crown, trying to lift a race of savages out of the slime
into which they have sunk. Let us look to the camps."

As they walked Cormac wondered. By what strange freak of fate had
such a man risen among this race of savages, survivors of a darker,
grimmer age? Surely he was an atavism, an original type of the days
when the Picts ruled all Europe, before their primitive empire fell
before the bronze swords of the Gauls. Cormac knew how Bran, rising by
his own efforts from the negligent position of the son of a Wolf clan
chief, had to an extent united the tribes of the heather and now
claimed kingship over all Caledon. But his rule was loose and much
remained before the Pictish clans would forget their feuds and present
a solid front to foreign foes. On the battle of the morrow, the first
pitched battle between the Picts under their king and the Romans,
hinged the future of the rising Pictish kingdom.

Bran and his ally walked through the Pictish camp where the swart
warriors lay sprawled about their small fires, sleeping or gnawing
half-cooked food. Cormac was impressed by their silence. A thousand
men camped here, yet the only sounds were occasional low guttural
intonations. The silence of the Stone Age rested in the souls of these
men.

They were all short--most of them crooked of limb. Giant dwarfs;
Bran Mak Morn was a tall man among them. Only the older men were
bearded and they scantily, but their black hair fell about their eyes
so that they peered fiercely from under the tangle. They were barefoot
and clad scantily in wolfskins. Their arms consisted in short barbed
swords of iron, heavy black bows, arrows tipped with flint, iron and
copper, and stone-headed mallets. Defensive armor they had none, save
for a crude shield of hide-covered wood; many had worked bits of metal
into their tangled manes as a slight protection against sword-cuts.
Some few, sons of long lines of chiefs, were smooth-limbed and lithe
like Bran, but in the eyes of all gleamed the unquenchable savagery of
the primeval.

These men are fully savages, thought Cormac, worse than the Gauls,
Britons and Germans. Can the old legends be true--that they reigned in
a day when strange cities rose where now the sea rolls? And that they
survived the flood that washed those gleaming empires under, sinking
again into that savagery from which they once had risen?

Close to the encampment of the tribesmen were the fires of a group
of Britons--members of fierce tribes who lived south of the Roman Wall
but who dwelt in the hills and forests to the west and defied the
power of Rome. Powerfully built men they were, with blazing blue eyes
and shocks of tousled yellow hair, such men as had thronged the
Ceanntish beaches when Caesar brought the Eagles into the Isles. These
men, like the Picts, wore no armor, and were clad scantily in coarse-
worked cloth and deerskin sandals. They bore small round bucklers of
hard wood, braced with bronze, to be worn on the left arm, and long
heavy bronze swords with blunt points. Some had bows, though the
Britons were indifferent archers. Their bows were shorter than the
Picts' and effective only at close range. But ranged close by their
fires were the weapons that had made the name Briton a word of terror
to Pict, Roman and Norse raider alike. Within the circle of firelight
stood fifty bronze chariots with long cruel blades curving out from
the sides. One of these blades could dismember half a dozen men at
once. Tethered close by under the vigilant eyes of their guards grazed
the chariot horses--big, rangy steeds, swift and powerful.

"Would that we had more of them!" mused Bran. "With a thousand
chariots and my bowmen I could drive the legions into the sea."

"The free British tribes must eventually fall before Rome," said
Cormac. "It would seem they would rush to join you in your war."

Bran made a helpless gesture. "The fickleness of the Celt. They
can not forget old feuds. Our ancient men have told us how they would
not even unite against Caesar when the Romans first came. They will
not make head against a common foe together. These men came to me
because of some dispute with their chief, but I can not depend on them
when they are not actually fighting."

Cormac nodded. "I know; Caesar conquered Gaul by playing one tribe
against another. My own people shift and change with the waxing and
waning of the tides. But of all Celts, the Cymry are the most
changeable, the least stable. Not many centuries ago my own Gaelic
ancestors wrested Erin from the Cymric Danaans, because though they
outnumbered us, they opposed us as separate tribes, rather than as a
nation."

"And so these Cymric Britons face Rome," said Bran. "These will
aid us on the morrow. Further I can not say. But how shall I expect
loyalty from alien tribes, who am not sure of my own people? Thousands
lurk in the hills, holding aloof. I am king in name only. Let me win
tomorrow and they will flock to my standard; if I lose, they will
scatter like birds before a cold wind."

A chorus of rough welcome greeted the two leaders as they entered
the camp of Cormac's Gaels. Five hundred in number they were, tall
rangy men, black-haired and gray-eyed mainly, with the bearing of men
who lived by war alone. While there was nothing like close discipline
among them, there was an air of more system and practical order than
existed in the lines of the Picts and Britons. These men were of the
last Celtic race to invade the Isles and their barbaric civilization
was of much higher order than that of their Cymric kin. The ancestors
of the Gaels had learned the arts of war on the vast plains of Scythia
and at the courts of the Pharaohs where they had fought as mercenaries
of Egypt, and much of what they learned they brought into Ireland with
them. Excelling in metal work, they were armed, not with clumsy bronze
swords, but with high-grade weapons of iron.

They were clad in well-woven kilts and leathern sandals. Each wore
a light shirt of chain mail and a vizorless helmet, but this was all
of their defensive armor. Celts, Gaelic or Brythonic, were prone to
judge a man's valor by the amount of armor he wore. The Britons who
faced Caesar deemed the Romans cowards because they cased themselves
in metal, and many centuries later the Irish clans thought the same of
the mail-clad Norman knights of Strongbow.

Cormac's warriors were horsemen. They neither knew nor esteemed
the use of the bow. They bore the inevitable round, metal-braced
buckler, dirks, long straight swords and light single-handed axes.
Their tethered horses grazed not far away--big-boned animals, not so
ponderous as those raised by the Britons, but swifter.

Bran's eyes lighted as the two strode through the camp. "These men
are keen-beaked birds of war! See how they whet their axes and jest of
the morrow! Would that the raiders in yon camp were as staunch as your
men, Cormac! Then would I greet the legions with a laugh when they
come up from the south tomorrow."

They were entering the circle of the Northmen fires. Three hundred
men sat about gambling, whetting their weapons and drinking deep of
the heather ale furnished them by their Pictish allies. These gazed
upon Bran and Cormac with no great friendliness. It was striking to
note the difference between them and the Picts and Celts--the
difference in their cold eyes, their strong moody faces, their very
bearing. Here was ferocity, and savagery, but not of the wild,
upbursting fury of the Celt. Here was fierceness backed by grim
determination and stolid stubbornness. The charge of the British clans
was terrible, overwhelming. But they had no patience; let them be
balked of immediate victory and they were likely to lose heart and
scatter or fall to bickering among themselves. There was the patience
of the cold blue North in these seafarers--a lasting determination
that would keep them steadfast to the bitter end, once their face was
set toward a definite goal.

As to personal stature, they were giants; massive yet rangy. That
they did not share the ideas of the Celts regarding armor was shown by
the fact that they were clad in heavy scale mail shirts that reached
below mid-thigh, heavy horned helmets and hardened hide leggings,
reinforced, as were their shoes, with plates of iron. Their shields
were huge oval affairs of hard wood, hide and brass. As to weapons,
they had long iron-headed spears, heavy iron axes, and daggers. Some
had long wide-bladed swords.

Cormac scarcely felt at ease with the cold magnetic eyes of these
flaxen-haired men fixed upon him. He and they were hereditary foes,
even though they did chance to be fighting on the same side at
present--but were they?

A man came forward, a tall gaunt warrior on whose scarred, wolfish
face the flickering firelight reflected deep shadows. With his
wolfskin mantle flung carelessly about his wide shoulders, and the
great horns on his helmet adding to his height, he stood there in the
swaying shadows, like some half-human thing, a brooding shape of the
dark barbarism that was soon to engulf the world.

"Well, Wulfhere," said the Pictish king, "you have drunk the mead
of council and have spoken about the fires--what is your decision?"

The Northman's eyes flashed in the gloom. "Give us a king of our
own race to follow if you wish us to fight for you."

Bran flung out his hands. "Ask me to drag down the stars to gem
your helmets! Will not your comrades follow you?"

"Not against the legions," answered Wulfhere sullenly. "A king led
us on the Viking path--a king must lead us against the Romans. And
Rognar is dead."

"I am a king," said Bran. "Will you fight for me if I stand at the
tip of your fight wedge?"

"A king of our own race," said Wulfhere doggedly. "We are all
picked men of the North. We fight for none but a king, and a king must
lead us--against the legions."

Cormac sensed a subtle threat in this repeated phrase.

"Here is a prince of Erin," said Bran. "Will you fight for the
Westerner?"

"We fight under no Celt, West or East," growled the Viking, and a
low rumble of approval rose from the onlookers. "It is enough to fight
by their side."

The hot Gaelic blood rose in Cormac's brain and he pushed past
Bran, his hand on his sword. "How mean you that, pirate?"

Before Wulfhere could reply Bran interposed: "Have done! Will you
fools throw away the battle before it is fought, by your madness? What
of your oath, Wulfhere?"

"We swore it under Rognar; when he died from a Roman arrow we were
absolved of it. We will follow only a king--against the legions."

"But your comrades will follow you--against the heather people!"
snapped Bran.

"Aye," the Northman's eyes met his brazenly. "Send us a king or we
join the Romans tomorrow."

Bran snarled. In his rage he dominated the scene, dwarfing the
huge men who towered over him.

"Traitors! Liars! I hold your lives in my hand! Aye, draw your
swords if you will--Cormac, keep your blade in its sheath. These
wolves will not bite a king! Wulfhere--I spared your lives when I
could have taken them.

"You came to raid the countries of the South, sweeping down from
the northern sea in your galleys. You ravaged the coasts and the smoke
of burning villages hung like a cloud over the shores of Caledon. I
trapped you all when you were pillaging and burning--with the blood of
my people on your hands. I burned your long ships and ambushed you
when you followed. With thrice your number of bowmen, who burned for
your lives hidden in the heathered hills about you, I spared you when
we could have shot you down like trapped wolves. Because I spared you,
you swore to come and fight for me."

"And shall we die because the Picts fight Rome?" rumbled a bearded
raider.

"Your lives are forfeit to me; you came to ravage the South. I did
not promise to send you all back to your homes in the North unharmed
and loaded with loot. Your vow was to fight one battle against Rome
under my standard. Then I will aid your survivors to build ships and
you may go where you will, with a goodly share of the plunder we take
from the legions. Rognar had kept his oath. But Rognar died in a
skirmish with Roman scouts and now you, Wulfhere the Dissension-
breeder, you stir up your comrades to dishonor themselves by that
which a Northman hates--the breaking of the sworn word."

"We break no oath," snarled the Viking, and the king sensed the
basic Germanic stubbornness, far harder to combat than the fickleness
of the fiery Celts. "Give us a king, neither Pict, Gael nor Briton,
and we will die for you. If not--then we will fight tomorrow for the
greatest of all kings--the emperor of Rome!"

For a moment Cormac thought that the Pictish king, in his black
rage, would draw and strike the Northman dead. The concentrated fury
that blazed in Bran's dark eyes caused Wulfhere to recoil and drop a
hand to his belt.

"Fool!" said Mak Morn in a low voice that vibrated with passion.
"I could sweep you from the earth before the Romans are near enough to
hear your death howls. Choose--fight for me on the morrow--or die
tonight under a black cloud of arrows, a red storm of swords, a dark
wave of chariots!"

At the mention of the chariots, the only arm of war that had ever
broken the Norse shield-wall, Wulfhere changed expression, but he held
his ground.

"War be it," he said doggedly. "Or a king to lead us!"

The Northmen responded with a short deep roar and a clash of
swords on shields. Bran, eyes blazing, was about to speak again when a
white shape glided silently into the ring of firelight.

"Soft words, soft words," said old Gonar tranquilly. "King, say no
more. Wulfhere, you and your fellows will fight for us if you have a
king to lead you?"

"We have sworn."

"Then be at ease," quoth the wizard; "for ere battle joins on the
morrow I will send you such a king as no man on earth has followed for
a hundred thousand years! A king neither Pict, Gael nor Briton, but
one to whom the emperor of Rome is as but a village headman!"

While they stood undecided, Gonar took the arms of Cormac and
Bran. "Come. And you, Northmen, remember your vow, and my promise,
which I have never broken. Sleep now, nor think to steal away in the
darkness to the Roman camp, for if you escaped our shafts you would
not escape either my curse or the suspicions of the legionaries."

So the three walked away and Cormac, looking back, saw Wulfhere
standing by the fire, fingering his golden beard, with a look of
puzzled anger on his lean evil face.

The three walked silently through the waving heather under the
faraway stars while the weird night-wind whispered ghostly secrets
about them.

"Ages ago," said the wizard suddenly, "in the days when the world
was young, great lands rose where now the ocean roars. On these lands
thronged mighty nations and kingdoms. Greatest of all these was
Valusia--Land of Enchantment. Rome is as a village compared to the
splendor of the cities of Valusia. And the greatest king was Kull, who
came from the land of Atlantis to wrest the crown of Valusia from a
degenerate dynasty. The Picts who dwelt in the isles which now form
the mountain peaks of a strange land upon the Western Ocean, were
allies of Valusia, and the greatest of all the Pictish war-chiefs was
Brule the Spear-slayer, first of the line men call Mak Morn.

"Kull gave to Brule the jewel which you now wear in your iron
crown, oh king, after a strange battle in a dim land, and down the
long ages it has come to us, ever a sign of the Mak Morn, a symbol of
former greatness. When at last the sea rose and swallowed Valusia,
Atlantis and Lemuria, only the Picts survived and they were scattered
and few. Yet they began again the slow climb upward, and though many
of the arts of civilization were lost in the great flood, yet they
progressed. The art of metalworking was lost, so they excelled in the
working of flint. And they ruled all the new lands flung up by the sea
and now called Europe, until down from the north came younger tribes
who had scarce risen from the ape when Valusia reigned in her glory,
and who, dwelling in the icy lands about the Pole, knew naught of the
lost splendor of the Seven Empires and little of the flood that had
swept away half a world.

"And still they have come--Aryans, Celts, Germans, swarming down
from the great cradle of their race which lies near the Pole. So again
was the growth of the Pictish nation checked and the race hurled into
savagery. Erased from the earth, on the fringe of the world with our
backs to the wall we fight. Here in Caledon is the last stand of a
once mighty race. And we change. Our people have mixed with the
savages of an elder age which we drove into the North when we came
into the isles, and now, save for their chieftains, such as thou,
Bran, a Pict is strange and abhorrent to look upon."

"True, true," said the king impatiently, "but what has that to
do--"

"Kull, king of Valusia," said the wizard imperturbably, "was a
barbarian in his age as thou art in thine, though he ruled a mighty
empire by the weight of his sword. Gonar, friend of Brule, your first
ancestor, has been dead a hundred thousand years as we reckon time.
Yet I talked with him a scant hour agone."

"You talked with his ghost--"

"Or he with mine? Did I go back a hundred thousand years, or did
he come forward? If he came to me out of the past, it is not I who
talked with a dead man, but he who talked with a man unborn. Past,
present and future are one to a wise man. I talked to Gonar while he
was alive; likewise was I alive. In a timeless, spaceless land we met
and he told me many things."

The land was growing light with the birth of dawn. The heather
waved and bent in long rows before the dawn wind as bowing in worship
of the rising sun.

"The jewel in your crown is a magnet that draws down the eons,"
said Gonar. "The sun is rising--and who comes out of the sunrise?"

Cormac and the king started. The sun was just lifting a red orb
above the eastern hills. And full in the glow, etched boldly against
the golden rim, a man suddenly appeared. They had not seen him come.
Against the golden birth of day he loomed colossal; a gigantic god
from the dawn of creation. Now as he strode toward them the waking
hosts saw him and sent up a sudden shout of wonder.

"Who--or what is it?" exclaimed Bran.

"Let us go to meet him, Bran," answered the wizard. "He is the
king Gonar has sent to save the people of Brule."



Chapter 2



"I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule;
From a wild weird clime that lieth sublime
Out of Space--out of Time."
   --Poe.

The army fell silent as Bran, Cormac and Gonar went toward the
stranger who approached in long swinging strides. As they neared him
the illusion of monstrous size vanished, but they saw he was a man of
great stature. At first Cormac thought him to be a Northman but a
second glance told him that nowhere before had he seen such a man. He
was built much like the Vikings, at once massive and lithe--tigerish.
But his features were not as theirs, and his square-cut, lion-like
mane of hair was as black as Bran's own. Under heavy brows glittered
eyes gray as steel and cold as ice. His bronzed face, strong and
inscrutable, was clean-shaven, and the broad forehead betokened a high
intelligence, just as the firm jaw and thin lips showed willpower and
courage. But more than all, the bearing of him, the unconscious lion-
like stateliness, marked him as a natural king, a ruler of men.

Sandals of curious make were on his feet and he wore a pliant coat
of strangely meshed mail which came almost to his knees. A broad belt
with a great golden buckle encircled his waist, supporting a long
straight sword in a heavy leather scabbard. His hair was confined by a
wide, heavy golden band about his head.

Such was the man who paused before the silent group. He seemed
slightly puzzled, slightly amused. Recognition flickered in his eyes.
He spoke in a strange archaic Pictish which Cormac scarcely
understood. His voice was deep and resonant.

"Ha, Brule, Gonar did not tell me I would dream of you!"

For the first time in his life Cormac saw the Pictish king
completely thrown off his balance. He gaped, speechless. The stranger
continued:

"And wearing the gem I gave you, in a circlet on your head! Last
night you wore it in a ring on your finger."

"Last night?" gasped Bran.

"Last night or a hundred thousand years ago--all one!" murmured
Gonar in evident enjoyment of the situation.

"I am not Brule," said Bran. "Are you mad to thus speak of a man
dead a hundred thousand years? He was first of my line."

The stranger laughed unexpectedly. "Well, now I know I am
dreaming! This will be a tale to tell Brule when I waken on the
morrow! That I went into the future and saw men claiming descent from
the Spear-slayer who is, as yet, not even married. No, you are not
Brule, I see now, though you have his eyes and his bearing. But he is
taller and broader in the shoulders. Yet you have his jewel--oh,
well--anything can happen in a dream, so I will not quarrel with you.
For a time I thought I had been transported to some other land in my
sleep, and was in reality awake in a strange country, for this is the
clearest dream I ever dreamed. Who are you?"

"I am Bran Mak Morn, king of the Caledonian Picts. And this
ancient is Gonar, a wizard, of the line of Gonar. And this warrior is
Cormac na Connacht, a prince of the isle of Erin."

The stranger slowly shook his lion-like head. "These words sound
strangely to me, save Gonar--and that one is not Gonar, though he too
is old. What land is this?"

"Caledon, or Alba, as the Gaels call it."

"And who are those squat ape-like warriors who watch us yonder,
all agape?"

"They are the Picts who own my rule."

"How strangely distorted folk are in dreams!" muttered the
stranger. "And who are those shock-headed men about the chariots?"

"They are Britons--Cymry from south of the Wall."

"What Wall?"

"The Wall built by Rome to keep the people of the heather out of
Britain."

"Britain?" the tone was curious. "I never heard of that land--and
what is Rome?"

"What!" cried Bran. "You never heard of Rome, the empire that
rules the world?"

"No empire rules the world," answered the other haughtily. "The
mightiest kingdom on Earth is that wherein I reign."

"And who are you?"

"Kull of Atlantis, king of Valusia!"

Cormac felt a coldness trickle down his spine. The cold gray eyes
were unswerving--but this was incredible--monstrous--unnatural.

"Valusia!" cried Bran. "Why, man, the sea waves have rolled above
the spires of Valusia for untold centuries!"

Kull laughed outright. "What a mad nightmare this is! When Gonar
put on me the spell of deep sleep last night--or this night!--in the
secret room of the inner palace, he told me I would dream strange
things, but this is more fantastic than I reckoned. And the strangest
thing is, I know I am dreaming!"

Gonar interposed as Bran would have spoken. "Question not the acts
of the gods," muttered the wizard. "You are king because in the past
you have seen and seized opportunities. The gods or the first Gonar
have sent you this man. Let me deal with him."

Bran nodded, and while the silent army gaped in speechless wonder,
just within earshot, Gonar spoke: "Oh great king, you dream, but is
not all life a dream? How reckon you but that your former life is but
a dream from which you have just awakened? Now we dream-folk have our
wars and our peace, and just now a great host comes up from the south
to destroy the people of Brule. Will you aid us?"

Kull grinned with pure zest. "Aye! I have fought battles in dreams
ere now, have slain and been slain and was amazed when I woke from my
visions. And at times, as now, dreaming I have known I dreamed. See, I
pinch myself and feel it, but I know I dream for I have felt the pain
of fierce wounds, in dreams. Yes, people of my dream, I will fight for
you against the other dream-folk. Where are they?"

"And that you enjoy the dream more," said the wizard subtly,
"forget that it is a dream and pretend that by the magic of the first
Gonar, and the quality of the jewel you gave Brule, that now gleams on
the crown of the Morni, you have in truth been transported forward
into another, wilder age where the people of Brule fight for their
life against a stronger foe."

For a moment the man who called himself king of Valusia seemed
startled; a strange look of doubt, almost of fear, clouded his eyes.
Then he laughed.

"Good! Lead on, wizard."

But now Bran took charge. He had recovered himself and was at
ease. Whether he thought, like Cormac, that this was all a gigantic
hoax arranged by Gonar, he showed no sign.

"King Kull, see you those men yonder who lean on their long-
shafted axes as they gaze upon you?"

"The tall men with the golden hair and beards?"

"Aye--our success in the coming battle hinges on them. They swear
to go over to the enemy if we give them not a king to lead them--their
own having been slain. Will you lead them to battle?"

Kull's eyes glowed with appreciation. "They are men such as my own
Red Slayers, my picked regiment. I will lead them."

"Come then."

The small group made their way down the slope, through throngs of
warriors who pushed forward eagerly to get a better view of the
stranger, then pressed back as he approached. An undercurrent of tense
whispering ran through the horde.

The Northmen stood apart in a compact group. Their cold eyes took
in Kull and he gave back their stares, taking in every detail of their
appearance.

"Wulfhere," said Bran, "we have brought you a king. I hold you to
your oath."

"Let him speak to us," said the Viking harshly.

"He can not speak your tongue," answered Bran, knowing that the
Northmen knew nothing of the legends of his race. "He is a great king
of the South--"

"He comes out of the past," broke in the wizard calmly. "He was
the greatest of all kings, long ago."

"A dead man!" The Vikings moved uneasily and the rest of the horde
pressed forward, drinking in every word. But Wulfhere scowled: "Shall
a ghost lead living men? You bring us a man you say is dead. We will
not follow a corpse."

"Wulfhere," said Bran in still passion, "you are a liar and a
traitor. You set us this task, thinking it impossible. You yearn to
fight under the Eagles of Rome. We have brought you a king neither
Pict, Gael nor Briton and you deny your vow!"

"Let him fight me, then!" howled Wulfhere in uncontrollable wrath,
swinging his ax about his head in a glittering arc. "If your dead man
overcomes me--then my people will follow you. If I overcome him, you
shall let us depart in peace to the camp of the legions!"

"Good!" said the wizard. "Do you agree, wolves of the North?"

A fierce yell and a brandishing of swords was the answer. Bran
turned to Kull, who had stood silent, understanding nothing of what
was said. But the Atlantean's eyes gleamed. Cormac felt that those
cold eyes had looked on too many such scenes not to understand
something of what had passed.

"This warrior says you must fight him for the leadership," said
Bran, and Kull, eyes glittering with growing battle-joy, nodded: "I
guessed as much. Give us space."

"A shield and a helmet!" shouted Bran, but Kull shook his head.

"I need none," he growled. "Back and give us room to swing our
steel!"

Men pressed back on each side, forming a solid ring about the two
men, who now approached each other warily. Kull had drawn his sword
and the great blade shimmered like a live thing in his hand. Wulfhere,
scarred by a hundred savage fights, flung aside his wolfskin mantle
and came in cautiously, fierce eyes peering over the top of his out-
thrust shield, ax half-lifted in his right hand.

Suddenly when the warriors were still many feet apart Kull sprang.
His attack brought a gasp from men used to deeds of prowess; for like
a leaping tiger he shot through the air and his sword crashed on the
quickly lifted shield. Sparks flew and Wulfhere's ax hacked in, but
Kull was under its sweep and as it swished viciously above his head he
thrust upward and sprang out again, cat-like. His motions had been too
quick for the eye to follow. The upper edge of Wulfhere's shield
showed a deep cut, and there was a long rent in his mail shirt where
Kull's sword had barely missed the flesh beneath.

Cormac, trembling with the terrible thrill of the fight, wondered
at this sword that could thus slice through scale mail. And the blow
that gashed the shield should have shattered the blade. Yet not a
notch showed in the Valusian steel! Surely this blade was forged by
another people in another age!

Now the two giants leaped again to the attack and like double
strokes of lightning their weapons crashed. Wulfhere's shield fell
from his arm in two pieces as the Atlantean's sword sheared clear
through it, and Kull staggered as the Northman's ax, driven with all
the force of his great body, descended on the golden circlet about his
head. That blow should have sheared through the gold like butter to
split the skull beneath, but the ax rebounded, showing a great notch
in the edge. The next instant the Northman was overwhelmed by a
whirlwind of steel--a storm of strokes delivered with such swiftness
and power that he was borne back as on the crest of a wave, unable to
launch an attack of his own. With all his tried skill he sought to
parry the singing steel with his ax. But he could only avert his doom
for a few seconds; could only for an instant turn the whistling blade
that hewed off bits of his mail, so close fell the blows. One of the
horns flew from his helmet; then the ax-head itself fell away, and the
same blow that severed the handle, bit through the Viking's helmet
into the scalp beneath. Wulfhere was dashed to his knees, a trickle of
blood starting down his face.

Kull checked his second stroke, and tossing his sword to Cormac,
faced the dazed Northman weaponless. The Atlantean's eyes were blazing
with ferocious joy and he roared something in a strange tongue.
Wulfhere gathered his legs under him and bounded up, snarling like a
wolf, a dagger flashing into his hand. The watching horde gave tongue
in a yell that ripped the skies as the two bodies clashed. Kull's
clutching hand missed the Northman's wrist but the desperately lunging
dagger snapped on the Atlantean's mail, and dropping the useless hilt,
Wulfhere locked his arms about his foe in a bear-like grip that would
have crushed the ribs of a lesser man. Kull grinned tigerishly and
returned the grapple, and for a moment the two swayed on their feet.
Slowly the black-haired warrior bent his foe backward until it seemed
his spine would snap. With a howl that had nothing of the human in it,
Wulfhere clawed frantically at Kull's face, trying to tear out his
eyes, then turned his head and snapped his fang-like teeth into the
Atlantean's arm. A yell went up as a trickle of blood started: "He
bleeds! He bleeds! He is no ghost, after all, but a mortal man!"

Angered, Kull shifted his grip, shoving the frothing Wulfhere away
from him, and smote him terrifically under the ear with his right
hand. The Viking landed on his back a dozen feet away. Then, howling
like a wild man, he leaped up with a stone in his hand and flung it.
Only Kull's incredible quickness saved his face; as it was, the rough
edge of the missile tore his cheek and inflamed him to madness. With a
lion-like roar he bounded upon his foe, enveloped him in an
irresistible blast of sheer fury, whirled him high above his head as
if he were a child and cast him a dozen feet away. Wulfhere pitched on
his head and lay still--broken and dead.

Dazed silence reigned for an instant; then from the Gaels went up
a thundering roar, and the Britons and Picts took it up, howling like
wolves, until the echoes of the shouts and the clangor of sword on
shield reached the ears of the marching legionaries, miles to the
south.

"Men of the gray North," shouted Bran, "will you hold by your oath
_now_?"

The fierce souls of the Northmen were in their eyes as their
spokesman answered. Primitive, superstitious, steeped in tribal lore
of fighting gods and mythical heroes, they did not doubt that the
black-haired fighting man was some supernatural being sent by the
fierce gods of battle.

"Aye! Such a man as this we have never seen! Dead man, ghost or
devil, we will follow him, whether the trail lead to Rome or
Valhalla!"

Kull understood the meaning, if not the words. Taking his sword
from Cormac with a word of thanks, he turned to the waiting Northmen
and silently held the blade toward them high above his head, in both
hands, before he returned it to its scabbard. Without understanding,
they appreciated the action. Bloodstained and disheveled, he was an
impressive picture of stately, magnificent barbarism.

"Come," said Bran, touching the Atlantean's arm; "a host is
marching on us and we have much to do. There is scant time to arrange
our forces before they will be upon us. Come to the top of yonder
slope."

There the Pict pointed. They were looking down into a valley which
ran north and south, widening from a narrow gorge in the north until
it debouched upon a plain to the south. The whole valley was less than
a mile in length.

"Up this valley will our foes come," said the Pict, "because they
have wagons loaded with supplies and on all sides of this vale the
ground is too rough for such travel. Here we plan an ambush."

"I would have thought you would have had your men lying in wait
long before now," said Kull. "What of the scouts the enemy is sure to
send out?"

"The savages I lead would never have waited in ambush so long,"
said Bran with a touch of bitterness. "I could not post them until I
was sure of the Northmen. Even so I had not dared to post them ere
now--even yet they may take panic from the drifting of a cloud or the
blowing of a leaf, and scatter like birds before a cold wind. King
Kull--the fate of the Pictish nation is at stake. I am called king of
the Picts, but my rule as yet is but a hollow mockery. The hills are
full of wild clans who refuse to fight for me. Of the thousand bowmen
now at my command, more than half are of my own clan.

"Some eighteen hundred Romans are marching against us. It is not a
real invasion, but much hinges upon it. It is the beginning of an
attempt to extend their boundaries. They plan to build a fortress a
day's march to the north of this valley. If they do, they will build
other forts, drawing bands of steel about the heart of the free
people. If I win this battle and wipe out this army, I will win a
double victory. Then the tribes will flock to me and the next invasion
will meet a solid wall of resistance. If I lose, the clans will
scatter, fleeing into the north until they can no longer flee,
fighting as separate clans rather than as one strong nation.

"I have a thousand archers, five hundred horsemen, fifty chariots
with their drivers and swordsmen--one hundred fifty men in all--and,
thanks to you, three hundred heavily armed Northern pirates. How would
you arrange your battle lines?"

"Well," said Kull, "I would have barricaded the north end of the
valley--no! That would suggest a trap. But I would block it with a
band of desperate men, like those you have given me to lead. Three
hundred could hold the gorge for a time against any number. Then, when
the enemy was engaged with these men to the narrow part of the valley,
I would have my archers shoot down into them until their ranks are
broken, from both sides of the vale. Then, having my horsemen
concealed behind one ridge and my chariots behind the other, I would
charge with both simultaneously and sweep the foe into a red ruin."

Bran's eyes glowed. "Exactly, king of Valusia. Such was my exact
plan--"

"But what of the scouts?"

"My warriors are like panthers; they hide under the noses of the
Romans. Those who ride into the valley will see only what we wish them
to see. Those who ride over the ridge will not come back to report. An
arrow is swift and silent.

"You see that the pivot of the whole thing depends on the men that
hold the gorge. They must be men who can fight on foot and resist the
charges of the heavy legionaries long enough for the trap to close.
Outside these Northmen I had no such force of men. My naked warriors
with their short swords could never stand such a charge for an
instant. Nor is the armor of the Celts made for such work; moreover,
they are not foot-fighters, and I need them elsewhere.

"So you see why I had such desperate need of the Northmen. Now
will you stand in the gorge with them and hold back the Romans until I
can spring the trap? Remember, most of you will die."

Kull smiled. "I have taken chances all my life, though Tu, chief
councilor, would say my life belongs to Valusia and I have no right to
so risk it--" His voice trailed off and a strange look flitted across
his face. "By Valka," said he, laughing uncertainly, "sometimes I
forget this is a dream! All seems so real. But it is--of course it is!
Well, then, if I die I will but awaken as I have done in times past.
Lead on, king of Caledon!"

Cormac, going to his warriors, wondered. Surely it was all a hoax;
yet--he heard the arguments of the warriors all about him as they
armed themselves and prepared to take their posts. The black-haired
king was Neid himself, the Celtic war-god; he was an antediluvian king
brought out of the past by Gonar; he was a mythical fighting man out
of Valhalla. He was no man at all but a ghost! No, he was mortal, for
he had bled. But the gods themselves bled, though they did not die. So
the controversies raged. At least, thought Cormac, if it was all a
hoax to inspire the warriors with the feeling of supernatural aid, it
had succeeded. The belief that Kull was more than a mortal man had
fired Celt, Pict and Viking alike into a sort of inspired madness. And
Cormac asked himself--what did he himself believe? This man was surely
one from some far land--yet in his every look and action there was a
vague hint of a greater difference than mere distance of space--a hint
of alien Time, of misty abysses and gigantic gulfs of eons lying
between the black-haired stranger and the men with whom he walked and
talked. Clouds of bewilderment mazed Cormac's brain and he laughed in
whimsical self-mockery.



Chapter 3



"And the two wild peoples of the north
Stood fronting in the gloam,
And heard and knew each in his mind
A third great sound upon the wind,
The living walls that hedge mankind,
The walking walls of Rome."
   --Chesterton.

The sun slanted westward. Silence lay like an invisible mist over
the valley. Cormac gathered the reins in his hand and glanced up at
the ridges on both sides. The waving heather which grew rank on those
steep slopes gave no evidence of the hundreds of savage warriors who
lurked there. Here in the narrow gorge which widened gradually
southward was the only sign of life. Between the steep walls three
hundred Northmen were massed solidly in their wedge-shaped shield-
wall, blocking the pass. At the tip, like the point of a spear, stood
the man who called himself Kull, king of Valusia. He wore no helmet,
only the great, strangely worked head-band of hard gold, but he bore
on his left arm the great shield borne by the dead Rognar; and in his
right hand he held the heavy iron mace wielded by the sea-king. The
Vikings eyed him in wonder and savage admiration. They could not
understand his language, or he theirs. But no further orders were
necessary. At Bran's directions they had bunched themselves in the
gorge, and their only order was--hold the pass!

Bran Mak Morn stood just in front of Kull. So they faced each
other, he whose kingdom was yet unborn, and he whose kingdom had been
lost in the mists of Time for unguessed ages. Kings of darkness,
thought Cormac, nameless kings of the night, whose realms are gulfs
and shadows.

The hand of the Pictish king went out. "King Kull, you are more
than king--you are a man. Both of us may fall within the next hour--
but if we both live, ask what you will of me."

Kull smiled, returning the firm grip. "You too are a man after my
own heart, king of the shadows. Surely you are more than a figment of
my sleeping imagination. Mayhap we will meet in waking life some day."

Bran shook his head in puzzlement, swung into the saddle and rode
away, climbing the eastern slope and vanishing over the ridge. Cormac
hesitated: "Strange man, are you in truth of flesh and blood, or are
you a ghost?"

"When we dream, we are all flesh and blood--so long as we are
dreaming," Kull answered. "This is the strangest nightmare I have ever
known--but you, who will soon fade into sheer nothingness as I awaken,
seem as real to me _now_, as Brule, or Kananu, or Tu, or Kelkor."

Cormac shook his head as Bran had done, and with a last salute,
which Kull returned with barbaric stateliness, he turned and trotted
away. At the top of the western ridge he paused. Away to the south a
light cloud of dust rose and the head of the marching column was in
sight. Already he believed he could feel the earth vibrate slightly to
the measured tread of a thousand mailed feet beating in perfect
unison. He dismounted, and one of his chieftains, Domnail, took his
steed and led it down the slope away from the valley, where trees grew
thickly. Only an occasional vague movement among them gave evidence of
the five hundred men who stood there, each at his horse's head with a
ready hand to check a chance nicker.

_Oh,_ thought Cormac, _the gods themselves made this valley for
Bran's ambush!_ The floor of the valley was treeless and the inner
slopes were bare save for the waist-high heather. But at the foot of
each ridge on the side facing away from the vale, where the soil long
washed from the rocky slopes had accumulated, there grew enough trees
to hide five hundred horsemen or fifty chariots.

At the northern end of the valley stood Kull and his three hundred
Vikings, in open view, flanked on each side by fifty Pictish bowmen.
Hidden on the western side of the western ridge were the Gaels. Along
the top of the slopes, concealed in the tall heather, lay a hundred
Picts with their shafts on string. The rest of the Picts were hidden
on the eastern slopes beyond which lay the Britons with their chariots
in full readiness. Neither they nor the Gaels to the west could see
what went on in the vale, but signals had been arranged.

Now the long column was entering the wide mouth of the valley and
their scouts, light-armed men on swift horses, were spreading out
between the slopes. They galloped almost within bowshot of the silent
host that blocked the pass, then halted. Some whirled and raced back
to the main force, while the others deployed and cantered up the
slopes, seeking to see what lay beyond. This was the crucial moment.
If they got any hint of the ambush, all was lost. Cormac, shrinking
down into the heather, marveled at the ability of the Picts to efface
themselves from view so completely. He saw a horseman pass within
three feet of where he knew a bowman lay, yet the Roman saw nothing.

The scouts topped the ridges, gazed about; then most of them
turned and trotted back down the slopes. Cormac wondered at their
desultory manner of scouting. He had never fought Romans before, knew
nothing of their arrogant self-confidence, of their incredible
shrewdness in some ways, their incredible stupidity in others. These
men were overconfident; a feeling radiating from their officers. It
had been years since a force of Caledonians had stood before the
legions. And most of these men were but newly come to Britain; part of
a legion which had been quartered in Egypt. They despised their foes
and suspected nothing.

But stay--three riders on the opposite ridge had turned and
vanished on the other side. And now one, sitting his steed at the
crest of the western ridge, not a hundred yards from where Cormac lay,
looked long and narrowly down into the mass of trees at the foot of
the slope. Cormac saw suspicion grow on his brown, hawk-like face. He
half turned as though to call to his comrades, then instead reined his
steed down the slope, leaning forward in his saddle. Cormac's heart
pounded. Each moment he expected to see the man wheel and gallop back
to raise the alarm. He resisted a mad impulse to leap up and charge
the Roman on foot. Surely the man could feel the tenseness in the
air--the hundreds of fierce eyes upon him. Now he was halfway down the
slope, out of sight of the men in the valley. And now the twang of an
unseen bow broke the painful stillness. With a strangled gasp the
Roman flung his hands high, and as the steed reared, he pitched
headlong, transfixed by a long black arrow that had flashed from the
heather. A stocky dwarf sprang out of nowhere, seemingly, and seized
the bridle, quieting the snorting horse, and leading it down the
slope. At the fall of the Roman, short, crooked men rose like a sudden
flight of birds from the grass and Cormac saw the flash of a knife.
Then with unreal suddenness all had subsided. Slayers and slain were
unseen and only the still-waving heather marked the grim deed.

The Gael looked back into the valley. The three who had ridden
over the eastern ridge had not come back and Cormac knew they never
would. Evidently the other scouts had borne word that only a small
band of warriors was ready to dispute the passage of the legionaries.
Now the head of the column was almost below him and he thrilled at the
sight of these men who were doomed, swinging along with their superb
arrogance. And the sight of their splendid armor, their hawk-like
faces and perfect discipline awed him as much as it is possible for a
Gael to be awed.

Twelve hundred men in heavy armor who marched as one so that the
ground shook to their tread! Most of them were of middle height, with
powerful chests and shoulders and bronzed faces--hard-bitten veterans
of a hundred campaigns. Cormac noted their javelins, short keen swords
and heavy shields; their gleaming armor and crested helmets, the
eagles on the standards. These were the men beneath whose tread the
world had shaken and empires crumbled! Not all were Latins; there were
Romanized Britons among them and one century or hundred was composed
of huge yellow-haired men--Gauls and Germans, who fought for Rome as
fiercely as did the native-born, and hated their wilder kinsmen more
savagely.

On each side was a swarm of cavalry, outriders, and the column was
flanked by archers and slingers. A number of lumbering wagons carried
the supplies of the army. Cormac saw the commander riding in his
place--a tall man with a lean, imperious face, evident even at that
distance. Marcus Sulius--the Gael knew him by repute.

A deep-throated roar rose from the legionaries as they approached
their foes. Evidently they intended to slice their way through and
continue without a pause, for the column moved implacably on. Whom the
gods destroy, they first make mad--Cormac had never heard the phrase
but it came to him that the great Sulius was a fool. Roman arrogance!
Marcus was used to lashing the cringing peoples of a decadent East;
little he guessed of the iron in these western races.

A group of cavalry detached itself and raced into the mouth of the
gorge, but it was only a gesture. With loud jeering shouts they
wheeled three spears length away and cast their javelins, which
rattled harmlessly on the overlapping shields of the silent Northmen.
But their leader dared too much; swinging in, he leaned from his
saddle and thrust at Kull's face. The great shield turned the lance
and Kull struck back as a snake strikes; the ponderous mace crushed
helmet and head like an eggshell, and the very steed went to its knees
from the shock of that terrible blow. From the Northmen went up a
short fierce roar, and the Picts beside them howled exultantly and
loosed their arrows among the retreating horsemen. First blood for the
people of the heather! The oncoming Romans shouted vengefully and
quickened their pace as the frightened horse raced by, a ghastly
travesty of a man, foot caught in the stirrup, trailing beneath the
pounding hoofs.

Now the first line of the legionaries, compressed because of the
narrowness of the gorge, crashed against the solid wall of shields--
crashed and recoiled upon itself. The shield-wall had not shaken an
inch. This was the first time the Roman legions had met with that
unbreakable formation--that oldest of all Aryan battle-lines--the
ancestor of the Spartan regiment--the Theban phalanx--the Macedonian
formation--the English square.

Shield crashed on shield and the short Roman sword sought for an
opening in that iron wall. Viking spears bristling in solid ranks
above, thrust and reddened; heavy axes chopped down, shearing through
iron, flesh and bone. Cormac saw Kull, looming above the stocky Romans
in the forefront of the fray, dealing blows like thunderbolts. A burly
centurion rushed in, shield held high, stabbing upward. The iron mace
crashed terribly, shivering the sword, rending the shield apart,
shattering the helmet, crushing the skull down between the shoulders--
in a single blow.

The front line of the Romans bent like a steel bar about the
wedge, as the legionaries sought to struggle through the gorge on each
side and surround their opposers. But the pass was too narrow;
crouching close against the steep walls the Picts drove their black
arrows in a hail of death. At this range the heavy shafts tore through
shield and corselet, transfixing the armored men. The front line of
battle rolled back, red and broken, and the Northmen trod their few
dead underfoot to close the gaps their fall had made. Stretched the
full width of their front lay a thin line of shattered forms--the red
spray of the tide which had broken upon them in vain.

Cormac had leaped to his feet, waving his arms. Domnail and his
men broke cover at the signal and came galloping up the slope, lining
the ridge. Cormac mounted the horse brought him and glanced
impatiently across the narrow vale. No sign of life appeared on the
eastern ridge. Where was Bran--and the Britons?

Down in the valley, the legions, angered at the unexpected
opposition of the paltry force in front of them, but not suspicious,
were forming in more compact body. The wagons, which had halted, were
lumbering on again and the whole column was once more in motion as if
it intended to crash through by sheer weight. With the Gaulish century
in the forefront, the legionaries were advancing again in the attack.
This time, with the full force of twelve hundred men behind, the
charge would batter down the resistance of Kull's warriors like a
heavy ram; would stamp them down, sweep over their red ruins. Cormac's
men trembled in impatience. Suddenly Marcus Sulius turned and gazed
westward, where the line of horsemen was etched against the sky. Even
at that distance Cormac saw his face pale. The Roman at last realized
the metal of the men he faced, and that he had walked into a trap.
Surely in that moment there flashed a chaotic picture through his
brain--defeat--disgrace--red ruin!

It was too late to retreat--too late to form into a defensive
square with the wagons for barricade. There was but one possible way
out, and Marcus, crafty general in spite of his recent blunder, took
it. Cormac heard his voice cut like a clarion through the din, and
though he did not understand the words, he knew that the Roman was
shouting for his men to smite that knot of Northmen like a blast--to
hack their way through and out of the trap before it could close!

Now the legionaries, aware of their desperate plight, flung
themselves headlong and terribly on their foes. The shield-wall
rocked, but it gave not an inch. The wild faces of the Gauls and the
hard brown Italian faces glared over locked shields into the blazing
eyes of the North. Shields touching, they smote and slew and died in a
red storm of slaughter, where crimsoned axes rose and fell and
dripping spears broke on notched swords.

Where in God's name was Bran with his chariots? A few minutes more
would spell the doom of every man who held that pass. Already they
were falling fast, though they locked their ranks closer and held like
iron. Those wild men of the North were dying in their tracks; and
looming among their golden heads the black lion-mane of Kull shone
like a symbol of slaughter, and his reddened mace showered a ghastly
rain as it splashed brains and blood like water.

Something snapped in Cormac's brain.

"These men will die while we wait for Bran's signal!" he shouted.
"On! Follow me into Hell, sons of Gael!"

A wild roar answered him, and loosing rein he shot down the slope
with five hundred yelling riders plunging headlong after him. And even
at that moment a storm of arrows swept the valley from either side
like a dark cloud and the terrible clamor of the Picts split the
skies. And over the eastern ridge, like a sudden burst of rolling
thunder on Judgment Day, rushed the war-chariots. Headlong down the
slope they roared, foam flying from the horses' distended nostrils,
frantic feet scarcely seeming to touch the ground, making naught of
the tall heather. In the foremost chariot, with his dark eyes blazing,
crouched Bran Mak Morn, and in all of them the naked Britons were
screaming and lashing as if possessed by demons. Behind the flying
chariots came the Picts, howling like wolves and loosing their arrows
as they ran. The heather belched them forth from all sides in a dark
wave.

So much Cormac saw in chaotic glimpses during that wild ride down
the slopes. A wave of cavalry swept between him and the main line of
the column. Three long leaps ahead of his men, the Gaelic prince met
the spears of the Roman riders. The first lance turned on his buckler,
and rising in his stirrups he smote downward, cleaving his man from
shoulder to breastbone. The next Roman flung a javelin that killed
Domnail, but at that instant Cormac's steed crashed into his, breast
to breast, and the lighter horse rolled headlong under the shock,
flinging his rider beneath the pounding hoofs.

Then the whole blast of the Gaelic charge smote the Roman cavalry,
shattering it, crashing and rolling it down and under. Over its red
ruins Cormac's yelling demons struck the heavy Roman infantry, and the
whole line reeled at the shock. Swords and axes flashed up and down
and the force of their rush carried them deep into the massed ranks.
Here, checked, they swayed and strove. Javelins thrust, swords flashed
upward, bringing down horse and rider, and greatly outnumbered,
leaguered on every side, the Gaels had perished among their foes, but
at that instant, from the other side the crashing chariots smote the
Roman ranks. In one long line they struck almost simultaneously, and
at the moment of impact the charioteers wheeled their horses side-long
and raced parallel down the ranks, shearing men down like the mowing
of wheat. Hundreds died on those curving blades in that moment, and
leaping from the chariots, screaming like blood-mad wildcats, the
British swordsmen flung themselves upon the spears of the legionaries,
hacking madly with their two-handed swords. Crouching, the Picts drove
their arrows point-blank and then sprang in to slash and thrust.
Maddened with the sight of victory, these wild peoples were like
wounded tigers, feeling no wounds, and dying on their feet with their
last gasp a snarl of fury.

But the battle was not over yet. Dazed, shattered, their formation
broken and nearly half their number down already, the Romans fought
back with desperate fury. Hemmed in on all sides they slashed and
smote singly, or in small clumps, fought back to back, archers,
slingers, horsemen and heavy legionaries mingled into a chaotic mass.
The confusion was complete, but not the victory. Those bottled in the
gorge still hurled themselves upon the red axes that barred their way,
while the massed and serried battle thundered behind them. From one
side Cormac's Gaels raged and slashed; from the other chariots swept
back and forth, retiring and returning like iron whirlwinds. There was
no retreat, for the Picts had flung a cordon across the way they had
come, and having cut the throats of the camp followers and possessed
themselves of the wagons, they sent their shafts in a storm of death
into the rear of the shattered column. Those long black arrows pierced
armor and bone, nailing men together. Yet the slaughter was not all on
one side. Picts died beneath the lightning thrust of javelin and
shortsword, Gaels pinned beneath their falling horses were hewed to
pieces, and chariots, cut loose from their horses, were deluged with
the blood of the charioteers.

And at the narrow head of the valley still the battle surged and
eddied. Great gods--thought Cormac, glancing between lightning-like
blows--do these men still hold the gorge? Aye! They held it! A tenth
of their original number, dying on their feet, they still held back
the frantic charges of the dwindling legionaries.

Over all the field went up the roar and the clash of arms, and
birds of prey, swift-flying out of the sunset, circled above. Cormac,
striving to reach Marcus Sulius through the press, saw the Roman's
horse sink under him, and the rider rise alone in a waste of foes. He
saw the Roman sword flash thrice, dealing a death at each blow; then
from the thickest of the fray bounded a terrible figure. It was Bran
Mak Morn, stained from head to foot. He cast away his broken sword as
he ran, drawing a dirk. The Roman struck, but the Pictish king was
under the thrust, and gripping the sword-wrist, he drove the dirk
again and again through the gleaming armor.

A mighty roar went up as Marcus died, and Cormac, with a shout,
rallied the remnants of his force about him and, striking in the
spurs, burst through the shattered lines and rode full speed for the
other end of the valley.

But as he approached he saw that he was too late. As they had
lived, so had they died, those fierce sea-wolves, with their faces to
the foe and their broken weapons red in their hands. In a grim and
silent band they lay, even in death preserving some of the shield-wall
formation. Among them, in front of them and all about them lay high-
heaped the bodies of those who had sought to break them, in vain.
_They had not given back a foot!_ To the last man, they had died in
their tracks. Nor were there any left to stride over their torn
shapes; those Romans who had escaped the Viking axes had been struck
down by the shafts of the Picts and swords of the Gaels from behind.

Yet this part of the battle was not over. High up on the steep
western slope Cormac saw the ending of that drama. A group of Gauls in
the armor of Rome pressed upon a single man--a black-haired giant on
whose head gleamed a golden crown. There was iron in these men, as
well as in the man who had held them to their fate. They were doomed--
their comrades were being slaughtered behind them--but before their
turn came they would at least have the life of the black-haired chief
who had led the golden-haired men of the North.

Pressing upon him from three sides they had forced him slowly back
up the steep gorge wall, and the crumpled bodies that stretched along
his retreat showed how fiercely every foot of the way had been
contested. Here on this steep it was task enough to keep one's footing
alone; yet these men at once climbed and fought. Kull's shield and the
huge mace were gone, and the great sword in his right hand was dyed
crimson. His mail, wrought with a forgotten art, now hung in shreds,
and blood streamed from a hundred wounds on limbs, head and body. But
his eyes still blazed with the battle-joy and his wearied arm still
drove the mighty blade in strokes of death.

But Cormac saw that the end would come before they could reach
him. Now at the very crest of the steep, a hedge of points menaced the
strange king's life, and even his iron strength was ebbing. Now he
split the skull of a huge warrior and the backstroke shore through the
neck-cords of another; reeling under a very rain of swords he struck
again and his victim dropped at his feet, cleft to the breastbone.
Then, even as a dozen swords rose above the staggering Atlantean for
the death stroke, a strange thing happened. The sun was sinking into
the western sea; all the heather swam red like an ocean of blood.
Etched in the dying sun, as he had first appeared, Kull stood, and
then, like a mist lifting, a mighty vista opened behind the reeling
king. Cormac's astounded eyes caught a fleeting gigantic glimpse of
other climes and spheres--as if mirrored in summer clouds he saw,
instead of the heather hills stretching away to the sea, a dim and
mighty land of blue mountains and gleaming quiet lakes--the golden,
purple and sapphirean spires and towering walls of a mighty city such
as the earth has not known for many a drifting age.

Then like the fading of a mirage it was gone, but the Gauls on the
high slope had dropped their weapons and stared like men dazed--_For
the man called Kull had vanished and there was no trace of his going!_

As in a daze Cormac turned his steed and rode back across the
trampled field. His horse's hoofs splashed in lakes of blood and
clanged against the helmets of dead men. Across the valley the shout
of victory was thundering. Yet all seemed shadowy and strange. A shape
was striding across the torn corpses and Cormac was dully aware that
it was Bran. The Gael swung from his horse and fronted the king. Bran
was weaponless and gory; blood trickled from gashes on brow, breast
and limb; what armor he had worn was clean hacked away and a cut had
shorn halfway through his iron crown. But the red jewel still gleamed
unblemished like a star of slaughter.

"It is in my mind to slay you," said the Gael heavily and like a
man speaking in a daze, "for the blood of brave men is on your head.
Had you given the signal to charge sooner, some would have lived."

Bran folded his arms; his eyes were haunted. "Strike if you will;
I am sick of slaughter. It is a cold mead, this kinging it. A king
must gamble with men's lives and naked swords. The lives of all my
people were at stake; I sacrificed the Northmen--yes; and my heart is
sore within me, for they were men! But had I given the order when you
would have desired, all might have gone awry. The Romans were not yet
massed in the narrow mouth of the gorge, and might have had time and
space to form their ranks again and beat us off. I waited until the
last moment--and the rovers died. A king belongs to his people, and
can not let either his own feelings or the lives of men influence him.
Now my people are saved; but my heart is cold in my breast."

Cormac wearily dropped his sword-point to the ground.

"You are a born king of men, Bran," said the Gaelic prince.

Bran's eyes roved the field. A mist of blood hovered over all,
where the victorious barbarians were looting the dead, while those
Romans who had escaped slaughter by throwing down their swords and now
stood under guard, looked on with hot smoldering eyes.

"My kingdom--my people--are saved," said Bran wearily. "They will
come from the heather by the thousands and when Rome moves against us
again, she will meet a solid nation. But I am weary. What of Kull?"

"My eyes and brain were mazed with battle," answered Cormac. "I
thought to see him vanish like a ghost into the sunset. I will seek
his body."

"Seek not for him," said Bran. "Out of the sunrise he came--into
the sunset he has gone. Out of the mists of the ages he came to us,
and back into the mists of the eons has he returned--to his own
kingdom."

Cormac turned away; night was gathering. Gonar stood like a white
specter before him.

"To his own kingdom," echoed the wizard. "Time and Space are
naught. Kull has returned to his own kingdom--his own crown--his own
age."

"Then he was a ghost?"

"Did you not feel the grip of his solid hand? Did you not hear his
voice--see him eat and drink, laugh and slay and bleed?"

Still Cormac stood like one in a trance.

"Then if it be possible for a man to pass from one age into one
yet unborn, or come forth from a century dead and forgotten, whichever
you will, with his flesh-and-blood body and his arms--then he is as
mortal as he was in his own day. Is Kull dead, then?"

"He died a hundred thousand years ago, as men reckon time,"
answered the wizard, "but in his own age. He died not from the swords
of the Gauls of this age. Have we not heard in legends how the king of
Valusia traveled into a strange, timeless land of the misty future
ages, and there fought in a great battle? Why, so he did! A hundred
thousand years ago, or today!

"And a hundred thousand years ago--or a moment agone!--Kull, king
of Valusia, roused himself on the silken couch in his secret chamber
and laughing, spoke to the first Gonar, saying: 'Ha, wizard, I have in
truth dreamed strangely, for I went into a far clime and a far time in
my visions, and fought for the king of a strange shadow-people!' And
the great sorcerer smiled and pointed silently at the red, notched
sword, and the torn mail and the many wounds that the king carried.
And Kull, fully woken from his 'vision' and feeling the sting and the
weakness of these yet bleeding wounds, fell silent and mazed, and all
life and Time and Space seemed like a dream of ghosts to him, and he
wondered thereat all the rest of his life. For the wisdom of the
Eternities is denied even unto princes and Kull could no more
understand what Gonar told him than you can understand my words."

"And then Kull lived despite his many wounds," said Cormac, "and
has returned to the mists of silence and the centuries. Well--he
thought us a dream; we thought him a ghost. And sure, life is but a
web spun of ghosts and dreams and illusion, and it is in my mind that
the kingdom which has this day been born of swords and slaughter in
this howling valley is a thing no more solid than the foam of the
bright sea."
