Actually, almost everyone agrees that the stories should be read in order of publication, not chronologically. Even Howard said as much. It's meant to sound like a series of stories, not one long story.

In the order they were published, we have...

The Phoenix on the Sword (1932)
The Scarlet Citadel (1933)
The Tower of the Elephant (1933)
Black Colossus (1933)
The Slithering Shadow (1933)
The Pool of the Black One (1933)
Rogues in the House (1934))
Shadows in the Moonlight (1934)
Queen of the Black Coast (1934)
The Devil in Iron (1934))
The People of the Black Circle (1934)
A Witch Shall be Born(1934)
Jewels of Gwahlur (1935))
Beyond the Black River (1935)
Shadows in Zamboula (1935)
The Hour of the Dragon (1936)

This list discounts four "lost stories" that were not published until very recently:

The Frost Giant's Daughter
The God in the Bowl
The Vale of Lost Women
The Black Stranger
