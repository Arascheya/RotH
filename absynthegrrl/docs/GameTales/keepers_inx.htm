<p class="pagecaption">Tales of the Hut</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Keepers of the Balance</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These are the adventures of Sophia Nelson in the Realms of the Hut. The Hut is a strange device that is able to cross dimensions and time in the multi-verse devised for pen and paper fantasy role playing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The worlds of the Hut span dimensions and time from the beginnings of a galactic empire to the shattered remains of the same.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The original game used rules from ADND, Arduin, Traveler, and Rune Quest original rules. As a result the stories will have that sword and sorcery, fantasy role playing game feel to them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The scenarios, worlds, items, and characters portrayed here are the property of the blog's author and the gamers who played in the multi-verse over the years. The game has faded into the depths of time, however, the characters refuse to go quietly into retirement. Thus was born this blog.</p>
