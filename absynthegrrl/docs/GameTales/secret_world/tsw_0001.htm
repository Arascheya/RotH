<p class="pagecaption">Tearing of the Veil</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I went to sleep listening to the unfolding disaster in Tokyo. Explosions and possible terrorist attacks in an industrial section of the city. Vague shadowy dreams haunted my restless sleep. I awoke with a start, coughing and hacking, trying to dislodge something in my throat. When it finally flew out and cleared my airway, I saw a shriveled husk of some type of insect.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dizziness hit when I tried to stand, dropping me back onto the bed. I reached for a longer shirt, intending to get a drink. Weird lightening flew from my hand and danced across the top of it for a few moments, then dissipated away. Moving very slowly, I was able to stand and shuffle to the tiny kitchen, grab water, then fall into a nearby chair. Everything around me wavered and shimmered, as if I was looking through glass with a thin film of water over it. My head pounded and heat flashes flickered up and down my arms and legs. I staggered back to the bed and fell onto it after finishing the water.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I awoke the next morning ravenously hungry. Standing was a bit easier, but the swimming vision remained. When I reached for my robe, there was no lightening. The cardboard pizza in the freeze wasn't nearly enough to sate my hunger, but it was all I had in the apartment. Usually I would take my meals at the university with my classmates. It was one of the ways I was forcing myself to learn Korean during my exchange student time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My hands were a bit shaky as I dressed to head to the corner market, but I could stand without swaying and move without tripping over my feet. It took three times as long to slowly walk to the place, get as much food and energy drinks as I could carry, and almost stagger home. Half the food was gone before I was satisfied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tried to concentrate on my class work, but reading was impossible. When I stood, the room spun and I rushed to the bed, falling into it once more. Fire chased through my nerves again as I tossed around on the bed. Screaming, itching, burning pain that didn't matter if cloth touched my skin or not. It spiked sharply, then let me fall back into sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next morning was a bit better. It only took half of the remaining food to calm the hunger. The walk to the store for more was almost normal. For a moment I thought I was well enough to go to class, but the shakes started to hit as I opened the apartment door and the dizzy, watery vision started in again. Once again I fell into bed shortly after another meal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next morning fire woke me. It crawled across my skin, played hide and seek along my nerves, and left me burning up from the inside. I hurried to the main room, to open the windows. They gave the best breeze. Just as I neared them, fire erupted from me, waves of energy flung the contents of the room away from where I was standing, then fire leapt from my mouth and lightening sprayed from my body, lifting me into the air and twisting me around. I dropped to the floor in a huddle when it switched off and lay there panting, waiting for the pain to fade. Then it hit again, drawing me up and flashing outward.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The fireworks erupted three more times throughout the day, leaving me drained and half conscious by the end. I didn't try for the bed, just collapsed where I lay.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Over the next two days I found I could control the energy, turning the snapping electricity on and off around my hands. I sat at the computer for hours, searching for information on the Tokyo disaster, strange insects, and anything else I could think of. Along the way I saw Seoul, London, New York, and other major cities were being cordoned off with check points to prevent possible terrorist actions. Other, less main stream and trustworthy news sources had fantastic stories of bizare creatures walking the tunnels below Tokyo. I found rumors of secret societies, fiction of all forms, lots of links to H. P. Lovecraft and similar writers, but no real information. I was deep in  links for Korea and China when there was a knock at the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A heavily tattooed man stood in the doorway, his lips sewn shut. I backed up, recognizing one of the tattoos as being from the Dragon, the secret society up on my browser at the time of his arrival. He raised a finger, pointed it at me and I awoke quite a while later, stretched out on a street, with rain falling in my eyes. I climbed to my feet and looked around. The street was empty and quiet with the high buildings of downtown in the distance. It looked like the older neighborhood where my friend Hyun Jae's parents lived, but the details were different.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A small child, dressed in a hooded yellow rain coat, flickered into view further down the street, then disappeared. The image had wavered through the snowy noise of an old analog television signal. It popped into view a bit further down the street, giggled, turned right, and went around a corner.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Curious, I ran to the corner and saw it a bit further on. It led me through the streets to the Kumiho Hotel, then up the stairs after it. I slid to a halt on the second floor, staring at the man that had come to my door. He motioned me forward, then into the room he was standing in front of. Inside was a woman in a loose kimono. She said a few words to me, but I forgot them immediately as she slid close and kissed me. Her tongue played with mine while her hands undressed me. I lay back on the bed, compliant and on fire. My extasy built quickly, brought forth by her skilled mouth and hands. I remember the last thing she said, "The one moment of absolute clarity comes in that brief exhalation of ecstasy."</p>
