<p class="pagecaption">Tearing the Veil (TSW)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bee stung me two weeks before my first term at Juilliard. I was at work, at the organic grocery, and it buzzed up from a bin of produce. I didn't think anything about it since I had been stung numerous times before, although, I thought I had seen a faint golden glow around it when I smashed it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty minutes later waves of heat rolled over me and sweat popped out, running down my face and soaking my clothes. Ms. Schultz, dressed in her typical shapeless, flower patterned, mumu, stared and said, "You don't look very good, dear. What's the matter?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know," I replied as a wave of dizziness hit. I stumbled into the bakery case I was getting her bread from. She came around, grabbed my arm, and steadied me as I almost fell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let me help you to the back. Mr. Arkov, could you help us to the back?" she helped me walk toward the doors to the back. I was starting to shake by the time we reached the doors. Mr. Arkov, the owner, came in behind us, just as violent cramps doubled me up and dropped me to the cold concrete floor. I fell into blackness as the convulsions started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My ears woke up first to the sounds of a heart monitor, voices in the distance, and paging speakers. Next came smell, disinfectant, cheap food, and my mother’s perfume. Vision returned last, blurry and foggy, like waking up with pink eye, where your lids are mostly crusted shut. I tried to reach them with my left hand, but it wouldn't move. My right hand wouldn't move either and panic started to set in. Something was irritating my nose, making it itch and there was a clogged feeling in my throat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A Korean looking woman, in a white coat, came hurrying in as nervousness started to increase into panic. "Ah, you're awake. Please, hold still a minute and let me get the feeding tube out." She carefully pulled a long tube out of my nose and then she untied my right hand. "I'm Dr. Kim and I have been attending you. Do you know what happened? Our tests show no reason why you should have been convulsing and comatose. You've suffered no brain injury or other indicator."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Scraping away most of the clots with my right hand let me open my eyes, but they didn't track at first. If you remember the really old television sets, the analog ones, they would turn "snowy" and wavery when a station wasn't coming in, that was what my eyes were doing. After much blinking and squinting, I looked at the doctor. For a second there was a faint halo of color around her, then it was gone. I blinked again and looked over at my mom. For a split second there was something blurry hovering over her left shoulder, then she came into focus. Her hair was a mess, her clothes were rumpled, and her eyes bloodshot and tired looking. It took several tries to get my voice working. "What happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You had an allergic reaction to something at the store. You were...it was bad..." tears tracked down her cheeks as she fought to keep her voice steady, "You were having convulsions and, well, reacting in other ways that left you dehydrated. No one was certain you ’d come out of your coma."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Coma? How long have I been here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Four days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Four days? When can I go home? My first term starts in just over a week and I'm not ready!" I struggled to sit up, but my vision snowed out and dizziness forced me back down. "Ok, not today, I guess." I looked around the room at the wires and tubes attached to me and tried to stay calm. "Any chance some of these attachments can come off?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Some of the monitors can come off. The IV needs to stay in a while longer, until I'm sure you can eat and drink normally. Do you have any idea what might have happened to you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, no. I was working with the produce, same kinds as always, I got stung by a bee, then I went over to sell some bakery to a regular..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stung? Are you allergic?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I've been stung lots of time before with no ill effects." My vision snowed out again for a second, throwing the room into a weird high-light of brilliance and deep, almost oozing shadows, then cleared again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What was that? You just twitched your head," Dr. Kim asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. My vision's been strange since I woke up. Every so often it will turn all snowy and wavy, like the really old televisions when they couldn't get a signal. It only lasts a moment, just long enough to notice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Any pain, headache, dizziness, nausea?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, just a moment of strange shadows and high-lights, then another burst of static and back to normal. Did you scan my head when you were testing me? Did you see anything strange?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not that would explain the vision issues, no. You did have very high brain activity, higher than many normal scans even, while in the coma. I want to monitor you tonight, make sure you can eat and drink without problems, then move you to a normal room tomorrow. If you are doing well by tomorrow night, I will consider releasing you." Dr. Kim turned back to the door, "I'll check in on you in the morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My mom was just putting her phone away when I looked at her. "Your father will be here in a little while. He can't wait to see that you have woken up!" She leaned in and carefully hugged me around all the attachments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Shan should end up meeting Traci Armstrong during her time at Juilliard, part of Shan's new vision is being able to see behind things, this might be how they get involved with Rani Corp, determine how "secret world" kinds of things apply in this time-line - there should be gate and demonic issues as well as other alternative things happening - the Hut has touched this word, particularly after Sophia, of CyCore Games, is recruited */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need a local weapons master that can provide her with talons and sword, she will hide sword in a long coat and talons in loose long sleeve items. Shan will favor blades and magic over guns - Martin Esterhaaz used to be a martial arts expert until a car accident damaged the nerves in his legs. Now he moves slowly and stiffly, however, he can still teach and has a side business creating high end weapons, mostly for collectors. Shan knows him through a mutual friend at Juilliard and will become close to him. He will teach her how to use her weapons and provide her with the best ones he can create. Martin is a bit stooped, very thin, with a shaggy mohawk. He moves slowly, favoring his left hip, which was the most badly damaged */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need game company name - CyCore Games */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* TSW version - Shan sees shadows representing faction around Dr. Kim when she comes out of her coma. Father is researching Iluminati, however, is not one. Mother is a Templar */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Elizaveta "Zava" Arkov - hacker extreme, works for her father, Anatoli Arkov, in the store and runs any computer or web based items for the store. She is an avid gamer and a follower of all CyCore titles. She will be granted early access to Realms of the Hut because of her long and close association, including agressive beta testing of other CyCore titles. She is a friend of Shan from working at the store. She envies Shan her dancing. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* stops "rape" of Marta by a shadow force outside Juilliard and takes significant damage as a result. Needs to figure out that Martin can also see through the veil and can supply her with weapons and training. Questioned by Detective Nikki Bishop after stopping the attack on Marta. Can only describe the attacker as tall, thinnish, dressed in dark clothes, using fighting claws, and wearing black ski mask - in actuality, not human, very thin, claws on hands, etc. Marta's description is no better. Suspect never caught because he was neutralized by Shan - not killed, just dispersed. Dispersed using magic she didn't know she had - there is no traner available for it, at least none she will be able to find. */</p>
