<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Angelique Lestrade - great great great grandaughter of Inspecter Lestrade, studying in Seoul for a year when things go down</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sequence is - T-7 days - bee and lightening to garment on end of bed; T-4 days - apartment trashed, sitting in corner, fireworks; T-2 days - control of energy; T-1 day - visitor, based on choice of faction</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tuppeny Dreadful books - located in Darkside, London - has been in the Lestrade family for generations. The Lestrade family in this timeline is an alpha variant of the Mega-Corp Ascendency thread - in this line, the Hut did not appear and Mereret was in London for the duration of Lestrade's life. He married another woman, although she knew of the strange affair between Lestrade and Mere, and approved. Lestrade and his wife had several children, including a girl named Angelique Mereret. The main character is named for this great great great aunt. The book store sells popular books from the font romms and houses an extensive occult and historical collection in the back rooms. Many of these are not for sale but can be accessed for a maintenance fee. Copies can be provided in electronic format for transcription fees. Ange spent many childhood hours reading through various items in the back libraries, including the case notes of Inspecter Lestrade.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Bugs, Issues, and Wishlist items</p>

<p class="regtxt5">WISH - Please add bare feet and bring the hot pants back - I like the long T-hirt and Hot Pants look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">WISH - Please return the bsic inventory to the earlier beta size.I have never understood the need to keep personal storage small in MMOs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">WISH - Longer Term - Locale/region/geo-filtering detection so those of us in non-prude countries don't have to pay for lowest common denominator silliness with regard to nudity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">WISH - Please do not totally lock out the casual player because of the whining of the "hard-core" players. We have just as much money to spend as they do, but don't need the level of mico-management and impossible enemies that they do.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">WISH - Please do not make it impossible to solo content, except for dungeons. Some of us appreciate the social aspects of MMOs but like to go solo, either because of inclination or because of real-world time constraints. Please do not make this impossible to satisfy the players shouting for more forced grouping.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">WISH - more "community spaces" in the Hubs - more clubbing options, eating places, shops, etc. Best way to encourage social behavior would seem to be more social areas for different tastes. Could even make them money sucks, of the "nickel and dime" category - low cost per item, but lots of fun items fo play with.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">WISH - Please add more to London and the other hub cities. Seoul is nice, but too small, same with New York. I would love to know what is behind the doors in the Bazalgette, for example. Also, it would be wicked cool to be able to go into Tupenny Dreadful books.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">WISH - AoC has a wonderful avatar creation system. I am curious why this wasn't used for avatar creation in Secret World.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">WISH - Sittable furniture in Horned God and other public places.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">WAY OUT THERE WISH - support undocking various main window items to a second monitor. For example, Chat, Inventory, and minimap. It would free up the main UI for an even better view of the world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">REQUEST - Please do not let the prudes convince you to change the Dragon open. This is perfect for what the Dragon is.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">REQUEST - Please thank all the Devs for their willingness to enter the mosh-pit of Beta testers and respond to our questions and demands, regardless of how silly or annoying.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">KUDO - awesome improvement to training area tutorial video!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">KUDO - fix on rubberbanding in Dojong on reentering the Dojong</p>

<p class="regtxt5">KUDO - nice lore update in beta 0.9!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">KUDO - New map position marker is much better, thank you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">KUDO - Thank you so very much for the pre-order point reward for Beta testers. I was happy to be involved without reward. This sweetens an already great time!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">KUDO - For resisting the demands to alter the Dragon opening sequence. It is my favorite one of a really fine set of starting points.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">BAD - Jumps to lore points shouldn't require hours of fruitless jumps. This is not fun, just annoying. Please loosen up the jump "hit pads" so we can reach the Lore. The jump fix in 0.9 makes the Dragon Lore very difficult to impossible for those of us without perfect coordination and mad keyboard skills. Challenges such as these should serve game play but not penalize those of us without perfect keyboard and mouse skills.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To REMEMBER: "/help guild" to get guild options in current builds</p>

<p class="regtxt5">try /e <space> see if get emotes, also try /emote <tab></p>
