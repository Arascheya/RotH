<p class="pagecaption">New Friends</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You would think that a store selling books wouldn't survive in a world where everything could be gotten through networked systems, and you'd be right for basic entertainment. Lestrade and Petrie Booksellers, my family's store, had given over half of the public sales area to rentable download stations and network points. We did a deslutory business with this. We made our money on people who wanted information, but didn't want any electronic tags, trackers, or other snooping applied to what the were looking at. It had gotten so bad we had day to week long waiting lists for access to some of our archives.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I am Angelique Mereret Lestrade and I am named for my great great great aunt. Lestrade and Petrie Booksellers has been in my family since it was started by Inspector Lestrade, his wife, and his best friend, John Petrie, in the late 1890s. It's been expanded many times and has mostly thrived through the years. It started as a place to sell new and used penny dreadfulls and news. The inspector had a fondness for rare books and the more arcane and alternative the better. After he retired from Scotland Yard, he made it the rest of his life's work to aquire as many as he could. We have scrolls from the library at Alexandria, verified by a reliable source, ancient texts from around the globe, and a copy of every Scotland Yard incident report ever written, the unaltered, original texts, that is.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I looked up from the old two-dimensional video game on the counter terminal when the door chime sounded. Another street rat had wondered in. She was medium height, scruffy, and had the usual bag over her shoulder. She looked around before slowly approaching the counter. As she came closer, I was struck by how familiar she seemed. "Hi," she started, then stopped. On close inspection her clothes were a costume. The dirt was real, but applied in more regular patterns than normal accumulation would cause. Her hair was ragged, but was in good health. Her skin wasn't as rough or undernourished as a regular street rat. This girl was slumming and that made her dangerous. The corps would sometimes send people in to try and recover our data.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How can I help you?" I asked. I pressed the second alarm under the counter, the one that told others to carefully monitor the new arrival, and left my fingers resting against it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, can I look at the special collections lists, the non-networked ones?" Her voice increased the sense that I should know her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you aware of the rates?" She nodded and passed over the access fee. The button under my fingers pulsed in the pattern for safe. "One moment, I need to get someone to watch the front." I pushed a different button under the counter and waited for my mother to come out of the back. "Archives," I said, nodding at the street rat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She followed me behind the counter and to the wooden door that closed off the rest of the building from the front. I waved my hand over a detector while making it look like I was reaching for the knob. The door swung open on silent hinges to the dark paneled hall behind it. Two meters down the hall I opened a door on the left and motioned the girl in. "The collections lists are in the shelf to your let. They are quite extensive, is there something I can help you find?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's awfully obscure, but I'm looking for information on the Marsters family. Specifically, Angelique Marsters, the one who lived in the late 1800's."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* REWORK - Ariana has a diary from the time that was written by someone close to the events of the time. The diary references Alice Crowlen, the people from the Hut, Angelique, and the Wellinghams. To one in the know, it reads as history. To others, it reads like a crazy person. Ange knows some of the truth of the time, from the inspector's files and records. Ange wouldn't reveal right away, not without more trust, so play it more like she is just helping Ariana find the right sections. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come with me, I know just what you want," I said, heading back toward the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've been fascinated by Angelique since I learned my great great great grandmother was named in honor of her. I know just the resources you'll want." We descended several flights of stairs into an older section of the archives. Behind a heavy oak door was a room furnished to look like a gentleman's study in the late 1800s. "This is the Inspector's study, from when he first started collecting and curating this archive." I sat in the chair behind the desk and pulled out a well worn notebook, bound in leather. "This is his personal diary."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The girl took it reverently, laid it gently on the other side of the desk, and opened it carefully.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was moving before she finished, pulling down three thick volumes and opening them to some well worn pages. "Take a look through these and see where you'd like to start, Ariana." It clicked with her request and explained why her clothes seemed more of a costume than real. Ariana Timmenson was a descendent of the Marsters family and the Collins family. She was known as Rianna Scarlet and was the hotest new performer on the music and video scene. "Can you be more specific? That time is a favorite of mine. I love to read the cases of Inspector Lestrade."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you know of Angelique? She isn't in the histories."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do you know about her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A great aunt just died and she sent me her books. Among them were letters and diaries from Edward Marsters and he mentioned his half sister Angelique. Some of the notes talked of the death of their parents and the changes it caused in her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* why is Ariana researching her past now? Does this story tie in with Jasmine in Seattle? How does this link to the Hut or does it? Part of Ariana's fascination will be with Angelique Marsters - Ariana is a descendent of Edward Marsters, Angelique' Marsters step-brother - remember Prague Cabal, definitely a secret group - "secret world" kinds of things definitely going on in the underlayer of the Ascendency world, left overs from the Stonehenge gate project and other occult happenings in this realm */</p>
