<p class="pagecaption">Boot Camp Graduation</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For all the hassle, boot camp passed very quickly. All too soon we
reached graduation, and assignment to our next duty. Annie had put in for flight school, I
had gone for tactics and analysis. We were given a full weekend leave as part of
graduation. I had planned to spend at least part of it with my father. My mother still
would not even acknowledge my existence. Annie was off to see her family, with promises to
stop by and see me on her way back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The time passed all too quickly, even without Annie around. My dad and I
swapped <a HREF="HBAnnie1.htm">boot camp</a> stories and rehashed old times. By the end of
the weekend he had become one of my best friends. When Annie showed up they took to each
other right away. I knew he had accepted me as a lesbian, but I still didn't press it with
Annie. We treated each other as nothing more than good friends for the entire weekend. She
had to report back sooner than I did, leaving early Sunday evening. When she was gone dad
commented, &quot;I like her, is she your lover?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Startled, I stammered back, &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Just the way you looked at each other sometimes. I wish you hadn't
let me get in the way. This would have been a good time for you two to spend
together.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We had gotten lucky, the flight school and the tactics school were held
at the same base. Annie and I were able to carefully continue our relationship. The weeks
passed in a blur of activity. She was top of her class as was I. I was so proud of her.
Every so often we would arrange to get weekend leave and meet somewhere away from the
base. Never did we hear of any suspicion about our affair.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the time for assignment selection came we both had first pick due
to our class standings. I opted to try for the intelligence service, partly through
curiosity, partly because that was dad's old group. Annie threw in for it also but was
skeptical, figuring they rarely if ever needed pilots.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A week before the end of classes dad called and asked if I would be
interested in taking a week of leave after school ended. I checked and found we had that
option before taking an assignment. When I said yes, he asked, &quot;Are you still seeing
Annie?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;When I can.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Do you think she could take leave too? If so I think I can arrange
something you might like.&quot; I pressed him for more info, but all he did was laugh.
&quot;You'll see.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Annie agreed, as I knew she would. We went over to dad's after the last
day of classes. He wanted to celebrate and give us a chance to unwind. He looked
thoughtful when we told him our assignment choices. It had been a long day with final
testing and exercises so we crashed early. Later I was up for a nature call and heard him
on the phone. He was downstairs, where I couldn't really hear unless I moved to where I
could be seen. The next morning he handed me a pair of tickets for a five day cruise in
the southern ocean. He smiled at my confusion and told me to read the brochure. The cruise
was set up by women, for women. Annie and I would have five days together, where prying
eyes would probably not look. I couldn't speak around the lump in my throat, so I hugged
him hard instead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The cruise was wonderful, but too short. Before we knew it we were back,
on our way to our next assignments. We had been selected for intelligence and were
assigned to a flight group. Annie was very surprised considering the pilot opening had
been a maybe when she applied. I was less surprised, I had seen dad's look when we told
him of our choices. What surprised me was he would push for us, knowing of our
relationship, and the attitudes toward it.</p>
