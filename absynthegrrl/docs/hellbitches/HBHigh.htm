<p class="pagecaption">High School</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I didn't go many places or do many things with my classmates. I was always
uncomfortable with my interest in them. Always there was a constant background of subtle
gay bashing. I tried going out with a boy, when I found one that wasn't all macho
posturing. He treated me well enough, but his advances left me uninterested. After that I
buried myself in studies and dance, avoiding as many social functions as I could. When mom
would ask if I was ever going to a party or a dance, then I would go. The only time I
really had problems was one year mom decided to get more involved with the school programs
and volunteered to chaperone a dance. Then I had to go and interact.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My sophomore year in high school a local chain store passed out a small directory of
help numbers for teens. In it was a number for an emotional crisis line. I agonized over
calling that number for weeks. I couldn't figure out what to ask, or what to even say. It
took all my courage just to admit to myself maybe I needed some type of help. Finally I
managed to call, and stay on the line until someone answered. He was very helpful, talking
with me until I felt more confident and then directing me to a youth support organization.
When I called a woman answered, identified herself, and talked with me for a while also.
She let me talk, waiting as I spilled my concerns, asking only enough questions to help me
get most of it out, then told me to call back any time I needed to.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I used that hot line extensively over the next month, calling at least four times a
week. Finally the staff there convinced me to call the local gay, lesbian, bisexual, and
transgendered youth support center. It took me quite a while to work up the courage to do
that, but finally I called and spoke to Judy, the director of the center. We talked
several times before she could convince me to come to a drop in meeting at the center.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The day of the meeting found me in front of the building, shaking with fear. Glancing
both ways, waiting until no one was watching, I entered the building and hurried to the
suite. Again when no one was watching, I quickly slipped through the door, pulling it shut
behind me. It was a pleasant room, warm and inviting, with a small couch, several chairs,
and a tiny desk with a pretty young woman behind it. When she saw me she smiled,
introduced herself as Judy, and told me everyone was eagerly awaiting my arrival. We went
through another door, down a short hallway, and into another small, comfortable room. As I
cleared the door I stopped, quickly scanning the room. Fear punched me hard in the guts as
I recognized several of my classmates. I turned to flee, only to encounter Judy in the
door. &quot;Please, stay a few moments. I think you'll find they're as nervous as you.
Give it a few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Seeing Shelly there was the biggest surprise. She was captain of the cheer leaders, a
member of the drama club, and an honors student. I had thought nothing could be wrong in
her life. She broke the ice first, inviting me over to where she was sitting. Her first
questions indicated her surprise at seeing me there also, but she worked hard to draw me
out and after several minutes I managed more than monosyllable answers to her questions.
She told me about her role in the upcoming drama club production and asked about my
dancing. &quot;We could use a few more dancers for the production, if you'd like to do it.
I saw you at the last recital, you are really good.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Flattered, I hesitantly agreed. As the afternoon wore on the others slowly drifted
over. By the time I had to leave I knew I had a place where I could go and others I could
talk to.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shelly was as good as her word. The next day at lunch she dragged me into the
director's office and waited as I ran through a short audition. He cast me as the lead
dance role. My mom was ecstatic, her daughter was going to be a star, and I was finally
going to meet people and maybe even find a boyfriend. I was ecstatic too, but for
different reasons. As rehearsals progressed Shelly and I became <a HREF="HBShell.htm">best
friends</a>. We were almost inseparable, doing practically everything together. Sometimes
we'd stay over at each other's house, that was the most wonderful and terrifying of all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All the stuff my parents presented during that time applied to relations with boys,
mostly not to do it. Mom's constant tirades about gays and lesbians would play in part of
my head while my body said different things. Sometimes when Shelly would touch me all I
could do was cringe and pull away, sometimes I would eagerly respond. After several tries
I hesitantly approached Judy for help. &quot;Officially I'm not supposed to know about or
encourage any activities of a sexual nature until you are over 18, but I also know how
unrealistic that is. First you have to find a way to accept yourself and give yourself
permission to be gay. Then if touching or stimulation makes you uncomfortable, you and
your lover need to find ways to ease past the blocks. Always easier said than done, I
know. Believe it or not I would personally recommend a book dealing with recovery from
sexual abuse. The relearning touch exercises seem to work very well for getting past these
problems. I also have a couple of good books at home, written by lesbians, about our own
particular sexual problems that might help. You're welcome to come by and read them. The
most important thing to remember, and by far the hardest thing to do, is to honestly
communicate with your lover about your problems. Only if she knows can she help.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Over the next several days I agonized over how to tell Shelly. Several times I started to try, only to quickly shut up when she mentioned things she was having trouble with. One night everything came to a head. We were at her place watching television after her parents left to visit some friends. When she reached over and started to stroke me I froze. &quot;Mirya, what's the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Voice trembling, body shaking I forced out the explanation. She sat shocked for long
minutes, then answered, &quot;How horrible! What can I do?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still shaking, I pulled the now dog eared abuse book from my pack and replied, &quot;There... there are some exercises in this that Judy thinks might help. Would you help me try them, please?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first few exercises were easy and fun. When we started on the ones where Shelly would touch me things started coming apart again. Part of the problem was she encountered things that caused her trouble as we tried to work through my problems. Then we would have to go back and try again until we could both get past our own blocks. I hadn't realized her tenacity until then. It had always seemed like everything came easy for her. Watching her struggle with herself helped me realize maybe part of it was incredible drive. Her efforts spurred me to try harder too. Worst of all we couldn't talk to our parents about any part of what was happening. Judy and her lover, Liz, became our confidants, filling the place of our parents. Contrary to official policy, they often let us use their apartment as a private place.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took six months to get to our first time of actual love making. It was worth every
agonized moment. The glow in her eyes and the soft smile on her face are permanently
etched in my memory.</p>
