<p class="pagecaption">Mother</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were curled together on the couch, two weeks after Annie's return,
when she said, &quot;I have a favor to ask of you, babe.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Anything, lover.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I want to introduce you to my mother and brother.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I am who I am, and it's time they realized that.&quot; She had
recovered quickly after that first night. Once she had acknowledged the anger and
frustration, she had bounced right back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The morning after we arrived at her home I was sitting on the couch,
reading, when her mom, Stella, came in. She sat down across from me and asked, &quot;So,
you are my daughter's lover. What's it like?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;What's what like?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Your relationship.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Confused, I replied, &quot;Like any other love relationship. Take any
description of the love between a man and a woman, it's no different than that.&quot; A
curious light burned in her eyes as she pressed for more and more detail. I answered her
questions as best I could until I ran out of things to say.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She started to ask yet another question when Annie's brother, Dave, came
in. &quot;I still can't believe you let that queer into this house. You've seen the effect
it's had on your daughter.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;The voice of the intolerant, and you call yourself a good person.
Why do I scare you so much? Do I force you to remember impulses you felt in the high
school showers? Maybe those times you almost couldn't hide your interest in your best
friend? You know, the more homophobic someone is, the more one has to wonder where their
fear comes from.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Shut up bitch! Everything you stand for is a crime against nature!
You can't even experience real love.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;And you can? I'd love to talk to your wife. By the way, where is
she? Why did she leave you?&quot; I had scored with that one, but maybe too well. For a
moment I thought he was going to come for me, as he stood shaking. Adrenaline pumped as I
readied myself for defense. With a look of pure hatred, he turned and stalked away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had forgotten Stella until I heard her quietly asking, &quot;What I
really meant was how does it feel to be gay?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I don't know. There's always the feeling that you're different,
that somehow everyone knows. If you're still in the closet, you live in constant fear
someone will find out and then the trouble will really begin. You always feel out of step
with the rest of the world, especially when thinking about love and relationships. Few
people outside the gay community acknowledge our existence or our needs.&quot; Lost in
introspection I barely heard her next question.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;<a HREF="HBHigh.htm">How did you know</a> you're gay?&quot;
Startled, I looked at her. Her face was turned away, as she tried to look anywhere but at
me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I don't know, I guess I first really knew during puberty. When I
saw my friends in the showers I would get excited. The one time we managed a peek into the
boys showers, nothing. I fought with my feelings for a long time. I needed someone to talk
to but didn't know who. My mom had made it abundantly clear she had no use for gays every
time she heard anything about us in the news. My <a HREF="HBFather.htm">father</a> was
away on <a HREF="HBMoms.htm">missions</a> more times than not, besides I never really felt
I could talk to him. What helped the most was a small booklet put out by a local chain
store. It was a list of numbers kids could call for help. In it was a number for a gay
support group. I agonized over that call for weeks. Finally I managed to call, and stay on
the line until someone answered. He was very supportive, quickly transferring me to a
woman contact person. She answered the questions I managed to get out, then probed with a
few of her own. When I was out of questions she gave me a number and told me to call her
any time I needed to talk. Over the next few weeks I called her at least three times a
week. Finally I agreed to go to the support group offices and meet with the infamous
&quot;encounter group&quot;. Actually it was a wonderful thing to finally be able to talk
to others my own age. We all had stories to tell and experiences to share. Several of the
others were from my school and we became good friends. Somehow just having others to share
with helped make things bearable.&quot;</p>
