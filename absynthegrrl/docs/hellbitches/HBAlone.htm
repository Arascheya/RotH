<p class="pagecaption">Loneliness</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was dancing to a new heavy metal disk, throwing myself around, trying
to release the agony in my heart when a knock came at the door. Startled, I stopped, sure
I had left a privacy sign on the door. Annoyed and nervous I opened the door, ready to
flay the intruder.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The words died in my throat as I saw Annie standing there. She held a
single red rose in one shaking hand. Scared eyes searched my face as she timidly asked,
&quot;Can ... can I come in?&quot; The anger and hurt I'd been nursing all month drained
from me at the empty look in her eyes. Unable to speak, I motioned her in. Her hand was
ice cold when she handed me the rose. She silently moved to the couch and sat huddled in
on herself, eyes downcast. Where was the bold Annie I knew, what had happened to her? I
wanted to speak, say something, but the cold hand squeezing my heart also held my voice.
Tears running down my face I sat while she quietly and emotionlessly told me about her
time away. She had taken lovers, many of them, but still she felt empty. She finally let
her brother talk her into taking the cure, convinced she would feel better if she could
just be straight. She lasted through four treatments before she ran. She finished and sat
for a few minutes, waiting for me to speak, to move.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stunned, I couldn't believe it. She thought this was all her fault, I'd
been the bitch, not her, couldn't she see that? Once again I tried to say something but
nothing came out. She stood and headed toward the door. I knew if she left I'd never see
her again. As her hand touched the doorknob I finally managed an agonized &quot;NO!
Please, don't go, not yet, please.&quot; Slowly she turned and stared at me with those
empty eyes. &quot;Annie, you mean everything to me. Please, I love you, I want you, can we
at least talk?&quot; I saw a faint flicker in her eyes as slowly she returned to the
couch. Over and over I had rehearsed how I was going to apologize to her, but always I had
seen her with her usual fire, not as she was now. I stammered out a confused attempt at
what I wanted to say, then ran out of words again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We sat in strained silence for years, before she said, &quot;I don't
know if I can stay with you any more. I don't know if I can be happy as a lesbian. I
surely don't know if I can rejoin this band of killers.&quot; I bit back my angry reply, I
guess in the eyes of her family we were killers, even though we rarely did the actual
deed. Several times she had seen how much <a HREF="HBMiss.htm">killing</a> tore me up. I
hoped in time she would remember.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please, at least stay here tonight, you can have the bed, I'll
sleep out here." She eventually shrugged, as if it didn't matter anyway, and headed
to the bedroom. Silently I opened the door and slipped out. I ran to Sarah's room and told
her she was in charge until relieved, then I returned, put the skull and crossbones sign
on my door and curled up on the couch. More scared than I'd ever been, I lay awake,
wondering if I was still going to lose her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had just gotten to sleep when I heard screams from the bedroom. Heart
pounding I ran to the door and threw it open. Annie was huddled against the far wall, eyes
wide and shaking. I moved towards her, only to be thrown against the wall and pinned there
by the violence in her voice. &quot;Don't come near me you queer. I won't have you
touching me. If it hadn't been for you my father would be alive. I'd have become a
straight and they wouldn't have killed him.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Despair washed through me, releasing me. Like a puppet with its strings
cut, I slid down the wall. Suddenly it all came clear. Why hadn't I seen it when it
mattered? &quot;Annie, you don't know that.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Don't ever call me that again. My name is Stacy, Annie is a
queer's name. They killed him. All he was doing was carrying a gay news magazine and they
killed him. If he hadn't been trying to figure me out he would still be alive.&quot; Her
voice broke on the last sentence and she curled forward, sobbing. Her sobs rained on me
like blows, numbing me. Slowly I crawled to the bed and hauled myself up. Gently I reached
out to hold her. Recoiling as if burned, she slapped my hand away. Sobs continued to wrack
her gaunt body as I reached again and laid my hand on her shoulder. For a moment she
stiffened, then collapsed into my arms. I held and rocked her until she cried herself out,
then gently laid her down. I curled tight against her and held her as she slept. Shortly
before morning I awoke and carefully slipped away from her. Tortured by fear, guts twisted
and churning, I fought to keep from shaking. Afraid of her reactions, I sat on the far
side of the bed watching her. She looked so fragile, curled up in sleep. I could barely
resist reaching out and brushing her hair away from her face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As I watched she started twitching as her hand began searching the bed.
Slowly I moved closer until her hand brushed against my arm. Half asleep she moved her
hand up until it rested against my cheek, then she slid over and wrapped herself against
me. Immediately her twitching stopped and she slid back into sleep. Heart soaring, I held
her as tightly as I could without awakening her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I must have fallen asleep again because the next thing I remember was
awakening to her hand tenderly exploring my face. Sleepily I opened my eyes and looked up,
to see her face looking down at me. &quot;Shh babe, don't move. Please just let me love
you.&quot; Her eyes were still scared, but I saw a glimmer of the old fire in their
depths.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Much later, basking in the afterglow, she raised herself on one arm and
looked down at me. Softly she said, &quot;My name is Annie and I am a queer. I love you
more than anything, Mirya Koren.&quot; The old fire was back, but then it dimmed as she
continued, &quot;Will you let me stay, after everything I said last night?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Yes, oh yes! I love you with all my heart, babe.&quot; I pulled
her down and smothered her with kisses.</p>
