<p class="pagecaption">After</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bright light shone in my eyes and a warm breeze tickled my hair. For
long moments I didn't remember anything of <a HREF="HBEnd.htm">how I had gotten here</a>.
I heard water in the distance. The sound of it flooded my senses bringing thirst like I'd
never known. Stretching, I opened my eyes and looked for it. I saw a fountain bubbling
with crystal clear water, bathed in the warmth of afternoon sunlight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As I looked, I knew I didn't want to drink. If I drank I'd forget
everything - Annie, Shelly, all our times together. Just then I saw Annie getting up and
moving to the fountain. As I shouted, "Don't drink.." she reached forward and
gulped a huge draught. I curled forward into a ball as I saw her image shimmer and fade. I
was still calling brokenly, "Don't drink, please don't drink..." when a soft but
powerful voice spoke, "Do you love her so little that you would ask her to be untrue
to herself?"</p>
