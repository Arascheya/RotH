<p class="pagecaption">New Recruits</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We had carefully selected our positions for meeting the new transfers. I
was working on a heat seeker missile, Gale was well into the innards of one of her beloved
engines, Annie was nearby watching her, Jerry was checking the belt feed on one of the
chain guns, and John was fiddling with some of his ECM gear. I was dressed to surprise,
wearing a suede halter top with my flight suit tied around my waist and barefoot as was my
want. Red hair, tied back, exposed the lesbian lovers earrings I always wore, my first
gift from Annie.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Promptly at the appointed hour, the hanger door opened and the three
transferees filed in. They were dressed in spotless dress blues and carried their orders
neatly under an arm. With a brief look around they stopped and looked my way. I
straightened slowly, giving them ample time for a good look then said, &quot;Annie, the
new candidates are here, would you take them to the major's office?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Sure babe.&quot; With that she looked at Gale and said, &quot;Back
in a few,&quot; and headed off. Two of the recruits recovered quickly, the third couldn't
resist one last look around.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I gave them several minutes to cool their heels in the office, then
headed that way. I met Annie on the stairs up, &quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Two are probably all right, but straight. The third one may have
some trouble. I'm not sure if it was the view of your charms, or the informality of the
situation.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Thanks lover. I'll let you know soon, have everyone ready as
usual.&quot; After a brief kiss I zipped up my flight suit, grabbed my hat from a nearby
closet, and entered the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Officer present,&quot; barked the third one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;At ease, please be seated gentlemen.&quot; I said as I strode to
the desk. I could see a momentary widening of their eyes as they saw who Major M. Koren
really was.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Ok, we need to take care of some preliminary BS first. This is a
very informal unit, we function as an extended family, we have to. We all depend on each
other, on a mission we only have each other. Most times we can't call for backup. My word
is law, but I don't hold with rank or titles. I will tolerate no homo or hetero phobia, if
you have difficulty with different sexual persuasions, drop out know. There will be no
retributions. If I have to transfer you out later it won't be as pleasant. I will back you
and support you in every way I can; however, if you screw me, you will wish you had never
been born. I hate surprises but I respect honesty. Questions, comments?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They looked at me, then at each other. Finally the one Annie pointed out
said, &quot;I don't think I can deal with your level of laxness.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I'm sorry you feel that way, but thank you for your candor.&quot;
The other two looked nervous but said nothing as he marched out. &quot;Ok, now for a few
informal rules. Everything we do here is of course secret, even from loved ones. On that
topic, any relationships you form within the group are ok as long as they don't interfere
with mission effectiveness. You will be assigned single rooms, if, at any time, you want
to share with someone, it can be arranged. You will be expected to cross train into at
least one other area. If you are curious about more areas, go for it. We work hard and we
play hard. We consider ourselves a family. If problems develop we will all do what we can
to help you work through them. There is no real command chain here, feel free to talk to
me at any time. Which brings me to privacy, there is a rule here where you can put a
privacy sign on your door any time we are not on mission alert. No one will violate that
sign except in extreme emergencies. Conversely, if you find a sign on someone else's door
you are expected to return the courtesy. Uniforms are not required in our areas, so wear
whatever you feel most comfortable in. When we are in other areas of the base, then we
play by their rules. Very few of the base brass come over here. I think that about does
it. Welcome to the Hell Bitches.&quot; With that I flipped my desk sign to its normal
position, &quot;Mirya, den mother and bitch in charge.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They sat stunned. I gave them a few minutes to start to cope, then,
&quot;Now, lets go introduce you to the rest of the crew.&quot; I leaned over to the
intercom and announced, &quot;Bitches, pack meeting, ten minutes, fresh meat.&quot; I
could feel their uncertainty as I led them from the office to the rec area. They were
hustled down the gauntlet, each person introducing themselves and their specialty. When
they cleared the end of the line they were given a cold one and shown to a chair. After
that the team made sure everyone sat and shot the shit with them for a while. By late
evening we could tell they were starting to adapt.</p>
