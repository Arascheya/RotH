<p class="regtxt5">&quot;You're always off on <a HREF="HBMiss.htm">missions</a>. We risk
our lives daily, for what? So our citizens can kill each other in the street? Mirya, I
can't live this way any more.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;It's worse on the other side, surely you see the good we're doing,
keeping them in check. I can't abandon that. Besides, I would be bored in civilian life,
you would be too.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Don't you try and tell me how I'd be, what do you know about me
anyway? When do we ever have time anymore for us? There's always something to plan,
something you have to do. Well, I'm sick of it. I'm out of here, whether you come with me
or not. I can't talk to anyone, I can't go anywhere because I might be followed. I can't
take it, can't you understand? For you its one big rush, isn't it? You love the danger,
well I don't. I'm scared shitless all the time. You could die tomorrow, then what would I
have? I care for you too much to be able to handle that.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I have obligations, I can't just quit. Who'd take over?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Fine, I'll hand you a resignation tomorrow, for now I'm out of
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Annie, wait! Take leave, please, think about this first. Turn in a
resignation, but think about it. I promise if you haven't changed your mind in a month
I'll turn it in.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Fine, good bye Major Koren.&quot; Those words burned long after
she was gone. That night I finally saw what I had done. She had needed support over her
father's death and all I did was scream at her. I spent days looking for her, trying
everywhere to find her. I even called her homophobic <a HREF="HBMoms.htm">brother</a>, but
he wouldn't talk to me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I couldn't sleep in our bed. I took to staying up late and crashing on
the couch, even then I'd wake up hearing her parting words play over and over in my head.
How could I have been so stupid?</p>
