<p class="pagecaption">Endings and ...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As Annie and I sat waiting for them to find us, as we knew they would, I
found some of my last thoughts straying to our <a HREF="HBHosp.htm">apartment</a>. Why I
don't know. I was remembering all the good and bad times it had seen. Our <a
HREF="HBAlone.htm">loving</a>, our <a HREF="HBFight.htm">fights</a>, our times together
and alone. The long nights I spent when she left for a month, after our really bad fight.
The glorious time after she returned. The day her father died at the hands of a rabid mob,
and her having to stay alone because there was a mission I couldn't postpone. I wondered
who would clean it out, and what they would do with our few treasures, small things from
our lives together. The pictures from our <a HREF="HBGrad.htm">first trip</a>, the one my
father arranged for us. The little things we bought for each other, tokens of love and
sharing. For once I was glad we hadn't gone to the pound and picked out a cat, like we had
planned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Then I thought about the letters our families would get. What would they
say, we weren't officially supposed to be here. <a HREF="HBFather.htm">My father</a> would
understand, having been in this type of thing himself, but Annie's family had always been
civilians, opposed to what we did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Which brought my thoughts back to Annie. Our worst fight had been over
whether or not to stay in the services. I had wanted to, she had not. When all the angry
words were finished, she put in for leave, and left. She sent me a resignation notice, but
I was able to talk her into waiting until her leave was up before I would send it to be
processed. That was the longest month of my life. I couldn't sleep in the bed, it was all
I could do to enter the apartment. The last night of her leave she came by to talk. She
was thinner and pale, and her hand shook when she handed me a single red rose. Quietly she
told me about her time, how she had been through two brief affairs and was still
miserable. The sight of her broke my heart. I had wanted to be the cast iron bitch, hurt
and aloof; but, seeing her, all I could do was cry. Remembering, tears started again. I
turned to her and started to apologize, knowing now it would have been better for us to
quit. We would still have our lives ahead of us, instead of waiting to die in a forgotten
forest, in a place we weren't supposed to be.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Mirya, they're here,&quot; was all she said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I love you Annie,&quot; I said as we kissed, releasing the <a
HREF="HBAfter.htm">detonator</a>.</p>
