<p class="pagecaption">Shelly's Death</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Six weeks into our intelligence assignments my father called.
&quot;Mirya, you're friend Shelly is in the hospital, in really bad shape. You had best
hurry if you want to see her, they say she probably won't last more than a few days.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My commander came by moments after I had hung up. He took one look at my
face, asked what had happened, and told me &quot;Get out of here, get your butt to that
hospital. If you have someone who can take you, get them to go with you.&quot; I mumbled a
distracted thanks and hurried to find Annie.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took only moments to find her and clear her departure with the
commander. As we arrived at my car I tossed the keys to her, &quot;You drive.&quot;
Startled, she looked at me for a moment, then silently climbed in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the hospital I hurried to Shelly's room. One look through the door
and everything spun for a moment. She was covered mostly in bandages, tubes and wires ran
everywhere. When she saw me she managed a shaky smile, &quot;Hi lover.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;What happened?&quot; The tale of her life after leaving for
college froze my blood. I couldn't keep the shock and horror off my face as I unthinkingly
blurted out, &quot;But WHY?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I don't know what happened. Things got a little bad when I told my
parents I was lesbian, but I thought they had been coping. Then I was lonely without you
and met someone I thought was good for me. She introduced me to some of her friends and
things got a little strange, but nothing really raised any flags. Then came a few rather
wild parties, and the subtle pressures to try this or that. Somehow I never quite realized
what was going on until it was too late. When I tried to get out they did this to me. I
wish now that you had been there. You always seemed to know what was going on, and when to
back away. How I always envied you. You were always so strong and sure of yourself, always
the scrapper. I wish now I had stayed with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Bullshit, I was always the scared, dumb service brat. You
were...&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Stop it, just STOP IT! If you love me at all you will stop doing
that to yourself. You are stronger than you know, the rest of us see it. Why can't
you?&quot; Slowly the room came in to focus as we talked of happier times. There were no
flowers or cards, nothing but empty walls and a small table with a pitcher of water and a
deck of playing cards. The other bed was empty. I wanted to ask where her family was, if
they even knew what happened, but somehow I didn't have the courage. Time passed quickly
and slowly, a feeling I still don't understand. All too soon a nurse was telling us only a
few more minutes until visiting time was over. &quot;Would you please hold me? For a few
moments, like you used to?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Carefully I threaded my way through the tubes and wires and held her, my
cheek resting against hers. &quot;Remember, I love you,&quot; was the last thing she said.
I couldn't see through my tears as suddenly alarms went off all over the place. It took
long moments before I realized what they really meant. I screamed &quot;No, Shelly!&quot;
just as the trauma team arrived. I was shoved aside and left slumped in a corner while
they worked on her. Even I could see it wasn't helping. Another nurse charged into the
room with yet another piece of equipment and stopped cold when she saw me. She dropped her
burden and then gently lead me from the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next thing I remember with any clarity was Annie's arms around me,
as I cried myself out. Just when I thought I was done a young doctor entered the room. He
took in the scene, blushed, and then nervously began, &quot;Ah.. I'm afraid Ms. Kingston
is gone. We tried everything we could, but it didn't help. I'm terribly sorry.&quot; He
continued for a few more minutes, then started to retreat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Has her family been notified?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He turned even redder as he answered, &quot;The people she gave as her
parents say they have no daughter by that name.&quot; If he could have he would have run
from the room, as it was he just hurried. When the shock wore off all I saw was red as I
stormed to the nurse's station and demanded a phone. I was half way through dialing when
Annie finally got through the rage with her calm words. &quot;I know you want to kill
them, but what about your friend, shouldn't something be done for her?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stopped and thought a bit. She was right as usual. &quot;What
arrangements are made for someone without next of kin?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Usually they are cremated and buried after a simple
non-denominational service, why?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I want to make the arrangements for her burial. Is there any way I
can do that?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I'm sure something can be worked out. You'll need to check with the business office and her doctor though.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The arrangements took several days and cost me a great deal of my
savings, but when the memorial was finished and her ashes given to me, I felt better able
to accept what had happened. Rather than vent my anger at her parents I sent them an
invitation to the service. They never even acknowledged the note. I used the gym
facilities more strenuously over the next months until I had vented most of the anger I
still felt towards them.</p>
