<p class="pagecaption">Mission of Changes</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My team was assigned to penetrate a satellite republic and gather what
we could about a missile factory in that area. We were given everything the sky spooks had
on the area and tasked to leave in two weeks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We departed with the standard crew of five. Everything went fine until
it was time to pull out. We were doing our final checks when a shot rang out. Annie
dropped as the rest of us dove for cover.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Adrenaline pumping, I crawled for the trees near the sound. Crouched
near a tree was a lone sniper, waiting patiently for one of us to reappear. Silently I
slid my knife out and stalked toward him. He never heard a sound, until I buried the knife
in his heart. Shaking, trying desperately not to collapse puking, I ran back to Annie.
Already Theresa was working on her, packing gauze into the hole in her shoulder. Annie
gave me a weak grin as I knelt near her. &quot;Looks like this time we'll have to whistle
for the extraction crew.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Yeah, although I doubt any of us will live to tell about it.&quot;
Fred started toward the ship, as I hissed for him to stop a moment. I leaned very close
and quietly asked, &quot;You've been teaching me to fly, do you think I could get us
out?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Do you think you could do it?&quot; I sat back and thought for
several minutes, then nodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;With you talking me through it, I think I can. Ok team, we have
two choices, we can call for an extraction team, or I can try and fly us out of here. The
chances of the team getting to us without compromising us is very small. I feel
comfortable with doing this if you are willing. Comments, suggestions?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They were a good team, they thought for a moment, then Sarah said,
&quot;I think we go for it.&quot; The others quickly agreed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Then load and prepare to lift. Theresa, if you could help Annie
into the command chair, thanks.&quot; With that I began to strip off my boots.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Startled, Annie asked, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;You know I can't drive with boots on, I certainly can't fly that
way either.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She talked me through start up and lift off. It was shaky, but even I
was surprised at how well it went. Seconds after we cleared, John yelled incoming and
began his ECM magic. I tensed and we started porpoising through the air. &quot;Mirya,
loosen up babe. You're too tense, you've got to relax.&quot; Annie began trying to calm me
over the intercom as I told John to arm the destructs. Annie tried again, &quot;Relax,
caress the controls, firm but gentle with your hands, just like I know you can. Think of
it as dancing with the clouds.&quot; Her words snapped me out of my panic and I once again
relaxed, flowing with the motions of the air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When John began calling range for the incoming patrol, I got crazy and
dove into the clouds near the mountains. Carefully, dancing with the air currents, I wove
around the mountains, until he reported the trackers had vanished. Annie was drifting in
and out of consciousness by then. My worst fear was she would die before we could get
back. I pushed the airframe as hard as I dared, keeping everything just below redline.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When we entered international airspace I sent our coded message,
&quot;The beach was wonderful this time. Only one of us took sunburn, but a pretty bad
case. It will be good to get back, though. The weather was too hot.&quot; As I finished I
knew the emergency crews were preparing for Annie and the set destructs on our ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When we neared the field I began trying to wake her, I needed her help
to land. &quot;Annie, wake up. I need your help landing, come on wake up.&quot; Nothing.
Frantic, I pleaded harder, &quot;Babe, I love you, I need you. Please wake up and help
me.&quot; She finally stirred a little, enough to get me started with the landing. As we
began final approach she passed out again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was out first and waiting for the med crews, even as the rest of the
crew grabbed data and cleared the ship. No one could get me away from Annie as they took
her to the hospital. Only when she was headed into the emergency room did I release her
hand and head back to the rest of the crew. On my way back I realized what I had done. I
had shown the world we were lovers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The messenger found me in my quarters, staring at the wall. &quot;The
commander would like to see you. I am here to escort you to his office.&quot; Numbly I
followed him to the commander.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Come in Major Koren, be seated. First I would like to congratulate
you on the successful completion of your mission. Then I would like you to explain why you
risked the lives of your crew on that stupid stunt you pulled. We have extraction teams to
deal with exactly this type of problem. Your orders specified you were to call them if
anything went wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Sir, in my judgement the extraction team would have been detected
and neutralized. We would have been compromised and the data lost. I acted in the best
interest of my mission and crew. An...Captain Perrez has been giving me flight instruction
in the event of this type of emergency.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Ah, yes, Captain Perrez. It is all over this base that you two are
lovers. You do know that don't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Yes sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Do you deny the allegations?&quot; Tired, depressed, and scared
about Annie, I was in no mood to try and dodge out of it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;No sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;You know that we do not encourage that type of behavior. Policy
says I am to separate the two of you as soon as we know if Perrez will survive.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;When will they know?&quot; For a moment nothing else mattered
except news of her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I'm not sure. They have the wound taken care of but she lost a lot
of blood. Maybe by tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;May I speak freely, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Yes major.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;With all due respect sir, we have been lovers since boot camp,
with no one having a clue until now. If I hadn't been so distracted, no one would know
even now. I am tired of hiding, and I'm tired of not being able to go home to her at
night. At least you can see your wife or lover at the end of the day. I don't understand
why what we have is so wrong, but I'm tired of hiding, whatever the opinions. I wish to
enter my resignation at this time. I will not leave Annie, she means too much to me. I
love my work and do not want to leave, but I love her more. I'll take whatever discharge
you wish and be gone by the end of the week. Just please, don't take this out on
her.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Hold it a moment, before you throw your life away, let me say
something. I said policy says I am supposed to separate you. I'm not sure what you
recovered on this mission, but a lot of people are impressed. I have been instructed to
turn your team into the core of a covert actions group, with you in charge. I will have to
dance a little bit with the official policy about you and Perrez, but I think something
might be arranged. You will be pleased to know that every member of your team came in and
tried to convince me that what you did with her, you would do with any of them. You have a
very loyal group there, I'd hate to see you throw that away also.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;What would I need to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Not much, just let me send you any others with your outlook and
give them a fair chance at your group, before I have to separate them. I am in agreement
with your viewpoint, the policy is bullshit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We will provide you with the empty hanger across the field, and some
resources for renovations. You will be provided equipment as it becomes available,
including some prototype stuff. I expect great things from you, Major Koren.
Dismissed.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;</p>
