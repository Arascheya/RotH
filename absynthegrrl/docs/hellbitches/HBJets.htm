<p class="pagecaption">Fighter Jocks (and jockettes)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Annie was off visiting her <a HREF="HBMoms.htm">mom</a> and I was bored.
When <a HREF="HBNewbie.htm">Gale</a> invited me to the officer's club with her and Sarah I
readily agreed. It was kind of a wild night and I had more than I should have. We were
sitting quietly when I overhead some comments from a group of fighter pilots at the bar.
&quot;... flare to land, squat to pee. Next thing you know they'll insist on training
women to fly. I wouldn't want one as my wing man, you could never tell when she might
freeze. Better they be kept out of combat entirely.&quot; Well, that cooked it. Without
another thought I was up and approaching the group.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Excuse me. What was that about women?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He was at least as far gone as I was. &quot;They should be kept in the
back lines and protected. They surely don't have the skills to fly fighters.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I happen to know several women who are excellent pilots, they can
put a tilt rotor where you'd never think of going.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Tilt rotor? Oh come on, there's no challenge to one of those. You
have plenty of time to think and screw around before you do anything. Now a fighter is a
different thing entirely. No woman I've met has the skill to handle one of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Look, flyboy, I bet you given three months I could kick your ass
in that computer controlled weapon you think you fly.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Oh you do do you? Well we'll just see about that. Tomorrow I'll
get you reassigned and then you'll see.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;You just go for it, flyboy. I'll be waiting. Make sure you get the
right person, Mirya Koren of the Hell Bitches.&quot; I saw two of his buddies jerk at
that. One of them tried to get his attention then. He brushed him off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;John Torrence, and I look forward to putting you in your place Ms.
Koren.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With a cool look at his crowd I strutted back to the table. Gale was
waiting. &quot;What do you think you're doing?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;He'll never be able to make good on it anyway, relax.&quot; The
rest of the night passed quietly. I arrived back shortly after Annie had. &quot;Shit babe,
I'd forgotten how obnoxious fighter jocks are. Oh well, I had fun with one tonight though.
I challenged him to single fighter combat in three months, its almost too bad he won't be
able to arrange it, I'd love to kick his ass.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;You what?!&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Some twit named John somebody was going on about women in combat,
and as pilots in specific. Well I told him that given three months I could kick his
ass.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;That wouldn't have been John Torrence by chance?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Yeah, I think so.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Mirya, I love you dearly, but there are days when you are so
stupid. John Torrence has taken top honors at fighter combat competition six times out of
the last seven contests. He pulls about as much power as you do. He will get you your
challenge.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next morning a message arrived requesting my appearance at the base
commander's office. &quot;Good morning major, I trust you had an enjoyable night last
night. You do remember last night don't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Yes sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;You know who you challenged to single competition then?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I do now sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I had thought about squashing this stupidity before it began, but
I can't really do that. What would it do for moral if command interfered with a challenge
between two prestigious units, the Hell Bitches and the Sixth Seaborn Tactical Fighter
Squadron? So, major, you will learn to fly and you had better take at least one kill. They
wanted to transfer you to fighter school, but I feel with the talents we have here we can
get you ready. I used to be a decent fighter jock in my day. You had best turn command
over to your second today, you start training this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Time passed in a rush of activity. I was pushed to the edge, then
beyond. I would wake each morning from dreams of flying and arrive home shaking from
exhaustion. Annie, bless her, was very supportive. Her only wish was she could have made
the challenge instead. &quot;Remember what I told you about flight, firm but gentle
control. Caress the controls, pretend they're me. Dance with the air, don't fight it.
Above all don't try and over control, in those things that'll kill you for sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Before I knew it three months had passed and the challenge had arrived.
Shaking, I climbed into my plane and began preflight. Moments later I was screaming toward
the sky, afterburners kicking. Gods what a rush! We engaged and I choked, within seconds
Torrence had lock and I was out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shaken, pride bruised, I concentrated on Annie's words and relaxed.
Suddenly it clicked, I was floating in the wind, dancing. Ducking and weaving I forced
Torrence into the defensive and kept him there. Try as I might I couldn't quite hold him
long enough for lock though. He slammed on the brakes, hoping I'd overfly him. Desperate I
threw into a hard sideslip, then dove for the hard deck. Blackness closing in, I leveled
out ten feet above and slammed back into a hard climbing turn. I was rewarded with the
sight of him dropping through the altitude limit. &quot;Check your altitude Mr. Torrence,
you're below the deck.&quot; The score sat at one and one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We engaged again. Eyes blurring from fatigue I pushed the airframe for
all I could get. He was doing the same. We danced and wove like two angry bears, searching
for the kill. His actions were deliberate, controlled, precise. Mine were instinctive,
fluid, and random. Our styles, so different, still seemed evenly matched. I could counter
his actions, but I couldn't get the edge, neither could he. The dance became more intense
as time went by, each of us getting more desperate as we tired. Years crept by until I
heard the commander's voice, &quot;Koren, Torrence, check your fuel.&quot; Looking at the
gauge I had five minutes left. &quot;Ms Koren, what say we return and finish this
tomorrow?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Sounds good.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He led the way back. I managed to land as well as he had. Shaking from
exhaustion, Annie had to help me from the cockpit. I had the satisfaction of seeing his
friends having to do the same. Leaning on a friend, he approached, saluted, and said,
&quot;Good flying major, you have proven yourself, and your point. If you want, we can
leave it here.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;We could, but that was too much fun not to do again.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He grinned then, &quot;I guess we had better finish it tomorrow
then.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Smiling, I agreed.</p>
