<p class="pagecaption">Father</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Why do you hate us? Our only difference is our choice of lovers. We go to school, work, laugh, and cry, just the same as everyone else. Why can't we be left in peace? How can ...&quot; Pain slammed through my shoulder. Without thinking I spun, right hand smashing into hard plastic, elbow driving into soft flesh as I fell. Blackness closing in I heard <a HREF="HBHigh.htm">Liz</a> calling my name. &quot;Mirya, hang on, we've got to get out of here. Everything's going crazy.&quot; Her strong arms supported me as something grated in my shoulder. Faces and bodies swam in and out of focus as I tried to walk. Ages later we reached her car. Gently she eased me into the passenger seat. When my left shoulder hit the seat back I screamed and blackness closed in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I awoke to my father's face near my bed, only it wasn't my bed. Disoriented, I scanned the room. &quot;Good morning kid. How do you feel?&quot; I tried to sit up, but couldn't. A dull ache started in my left shoulder. &quot;Awful, where am I?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;In the hospital with your left shoulder shattered.&quot; Memories of the rally
returned in a rush. &quot;We saw you on the news last night.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Oh, shit.&quot; Scared, I looked away as fear clenched my guts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Why were you there?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I... I needed to speak out. I couldn't let friends of mine stand there
alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I need to ask you, are you gay?&quot; I considered many moments, until he said,
&quot;I would like an answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still not looking at him I softly answered, &quot;Yes dad, I am.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I thought you might be. You're lack of boyfriends hasn't gone unnoticed. You're
mom's not going to deal well with this.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;I know, I've tried not to show it...&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Whatever happens, I want you to know I'm proud of you. All your life I've tried
to teach you to stand up for what you believe, to have pride in yourself. It looks like
I've succeeded. Things will not be good at home, but we'll get through them somehow.&quot;
</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Things were as bad as dad had warned. After I was released from the hospital my mom
wouldn't speak to me at all. Once I came into the kitchen unexpectedly to hear them
arguing, &quot;I want her out of here. I refuse to live in the same house with someone
like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After several weeks dad arranged for me to stay with the Marshals. Dad had served with
him in the intelligence section of the services for many years. It wasn't a bad place to
stay, once I convinced Tim, their son, that I really was gay. I stayed at their place for
the rest of my senior year and through most of the summer.</p>
