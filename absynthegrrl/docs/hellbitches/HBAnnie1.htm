<p class="pagecaption">Annie - First Meetings</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I still remember the day we first met. I had just arrived and received
my quarters assignment. I was debating whether to go get my gear or go to the barracks
first. I was standing near HQ when the bus pulled up and disgorged more recruits. She was
the last one off the bus. She looked so shy and nervous that I was about to go to her aid
when the drill instructor started hustling them away toward the induction office for
in-processing. As she hurried along all I could do was stare, she was so pretty.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I headed off to the barracks, to unload the few personal items I had
with me, then headed to the supply depot for my gear. This was to be the last day of free
time so I took full advantage of it and wandered the small park near the barracks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I saw her again in the mess hall. She was with the others from the bus
while I was with the few others who had come separately. When I sat down I arranged my
position so I could look at her. She had a small, elfin face, framed by a mane of wavy,
black hair. She had a delicately curved figure, so different from my own mannish build.
She was laughing and carrying on with her table mates like they had known each other all
their lives. Every so often she would glance around, once she looked straight at me and I
quickly looked away, blushing as red as my hair. Embarrassed, I hurriedly finished dinner
and headed for the barracks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still savoring the last day of freedom, I lounged on my bunk writing a
letter to my father. I was lost in memories when a large group arrived and started
throwing their gear into lockers. I glanced up and my heart did a quick flip, she was with
them, tossing her gear into the locker next to mine. Moments later she sat down on the
next bunk and said, &quot;Hi, I saw you at dinner. My name's Anastasia Perrez, but don't
let that scare you, everyone calls me Annie.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Mirya, Mirya Koren.&quot; Somehow it was all I could do to get my
tongue around my name.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Mirya, what a beautiful name! I wish mine was that pretty.&quot; I
was blushing again. Somehow all she had to do was look at me and I turned red. &quot;You
look like you know what's going on around here, maybe you can help the rest of us
out.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;My father was in the forces, most of my life was spent around all
of this.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Hey everyone, this is Mirya, she knows what's going on around
here, so if you have any questions, let her know.&quot; Face burning I tried to field the
flurry of questions suddenly thrown at me. In the space of five minutes she had broken the
ice in the entire room. What had happened to the shy face I saw getting off the bus? As
the questions continued to fly the DI walked in and yelled, &quot;OK children, lights out,
no talking, and no milk and cookies tonight. Your day begins promptly at 0500 hours
tomorrow morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The morning came much too quickly with the harsh, bright glare of the
overhead lights and the DI's yell of inspection in fifteen minutes. Scrambling, we
hurriedly fumbled with our unfamiliar fatigues. As we rushed to get ready Annie yelled,
&quot;Ok everyone listen up. Mirya what comes next?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Well the inspection will give them a chance to find fault with
everything we've done. They will be looking for ways to break you down, so they can build
you back the way they want you. We can surprise them a little if you make you beds like
this.&quot; So saying, I showed them how my father had taught me long ago. &quot;They will
be looking for any way to separate us and break us individually. The best defense we have
is to always work together, to be a close knit team. This is what they want to form in the
end anyway, so if we start early things will be slightly easier. Whatever you do, don't
try and take them on alone, and don't tell them anything. If they want to know something
make sure they have to work to get it.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As I finished my little speech the DI strode in and yelled us into
position by our bunks. She then proceeded to criticize everything we had done. I could
tell she had to work harder than she expected to find things wrong. We were then formed
into a line and marched to the parade field and drilled until the chow hall opened for
breakfast. We were marched in, sat at our reserved section, and introduced to the
&quot;square&quot; meal. I was very glad my father had prepared me for most of what was
happening.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The day passed in a haze of intense physical activity. Finally we were
marched back to our barracks and given ten minutes free time before lights out. Most of us
were too tired to do much other than collapse onto our bunks and wait for lights out, and
I had thought dancing had gotten me into shape. As I lay back Annie came over and said,
&quot;I don't know what we would do without you, Mirya.&quot; I found myself embarrassed
once again and sat in confused silence. Smiling she got up and stretched out languorously
on her bunk, unconsciously displaying herself to best advantage. I couldn't take my eyes
off her and I felt my face grow hot as I saw a sparkle of amusement in her brown eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On the fourth day one of our tasks was to select a person to function as
group leader. This person would basically end up as the one the DI would yell at the most.
She would be responsible for lights out, wake up, and other small details. I lobbied hard
for Annie, everyone liked and admired her. Whenever I would look I saw her moving around
talking to the others also. She would smile when I saw her. That evening the DI gave us
our one democratic decision of boot camp, choose our leader. I sat in stunned disbelief
when everyone else voted for me. Then the DI called me up to give me my first assignment,
take the recruits over to supply and get them sidearms. Frantically fighting through my
confusion I gave the commands to move them out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Later during our ten minute free time I asked Annie why. &quot;You know
the system. You know what they expect and can recognize the crap. You can translate what
they tell you into something we can understand. Everyone agreed you would be the best
bet.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next days passed in a blur of activity. We were rarely given time to
think. We lost two during those first days. I am proud to say both due to hidden physical
problems. At the end of the first week we were starting to have some energy left at the
end of the day. Many of us would talk and goof around during our small amounts of free
time. The DI and the other instructors were surprised by our unity, though none of them
let on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the end of the first week I was startled awake by movement of my
blankets, then by the presence of a warm body next to me. &quot;I've seen the way you look
at me. I know you want me. I thought I'd let you know I want you too.&quot; Annie, bold as
always, had slipped in next to me. Frightened, I tried to tell her what would happen if we
were found together. &quot;I know, I'll leave in a moment. Right now I just want to hold
you for a bit.&quot; I felt her warm lips against my neck as her breasts pressed against
my side. I wrapped an arm around her, held her close, stroked her hair for a few minutes,
then released her. She slid back out and over to her bed, blowing me a kiss as she went. I
lay there for long minutes puzzling over what had happened. I wasn't used to someone else
taking the initiative, it felt very good.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By morning my worry had turned to a perverse playfulness. I would find
ways to joke with her that went over the heads of everyone else, well almost everyone
else. I saw two of our group exchange knowing glances when Annie and I were having fun.
Two nights later I was awake when one of them got up and headed for the toilets. Moments
later the other one also got up. Quietly I followed. What I heard brought a smile and gave
me the courage I needed. When they returned to their bunks I gave them time to return to
sleep, then got up and moved to Annie's bunk. Silently I slid in beside her, awakening her
with a gentle kiss. &quot;Love, I need to go to the toilet.&quot; I saw momentary
confusion, followed by a smile of understanding. Moments after I slid into a stall Annie
joined me. Hesitantly I reached to hold her as she wrapped me in her arms and began a
slow, thorough exploration of my every curve and hollow. Joyously I returned her every
caress. Tongues tangled and explored as we tasted every part of each other, as we came we
screamed into each other's mouth so only a muffled explosion could be heard. Our orgasms
left us weak and shaking on the cold tile floor. Quickly we hurried back to my bunk and
wrapped up together until we were warm once more. After a lingering kiss Annie slid back
to her bunk and drifted to sleep. After long moments grinning foolishly at the ceiling, I
followed her lead.</p>
