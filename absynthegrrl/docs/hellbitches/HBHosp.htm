<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Ready to check out of this place babe?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;As soon as possible!&quot; I grabbed Annie's bag while she headed
off to the nurse station to sign out. She was still pale and I could tell she was hurting
as we rode the elevator to the garage area. I loaded her into my car and headed off toward
the hanger. As we passed the turnoff to the officers quarters she looked at me and said,
&quot;Babe, I want to go straight home.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;There's something I need to look at first.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Please, I just want to go home.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;It'll only take a minute.&quot; I pulled up in front of the fence
around <a HREF="HBNewbie.htm">our hangar</a> and got out. &quot;Could you come with me? I
want you to see this also.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Mirya Jean Koren, I am tired, I want to go home! I don't want to
follow you around on some stupid thing you could do tomorrow.&quot; Finally she hauled
herself out of the car, slammed the door, glared, and said, &quot;Ok, if I must. Let's get
on with it then.&quot; I almost told her then, afraid of how angry she was, but I still
wanted to see her surprise when I showed her the place. Nervously I hurried her through
the gate and into the building. I headed to the stairs, offering to help her along.
Angrily she pushed my arm away and labored up the stairs. &quot;This had better be
good.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Trembling, I opened the door on the right, at the top of the stairs, and
said, &quot;Welcome home, babe.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My stomach wrenched as she stopped, for a moment I was afraid she was
really angry, then I saw the tears running down her cheeks. Like a woman in a dream she
took in the room. I had tried to make it as warm and friendly as I could. There was a
second hand couch with an ammo box coffee table, covered with a colorful towel. There was
a small bookcase with our books, my stereo, and our disk collections. The small kitchen
was spotless with yellow curtains on the windows. Several of Gale's plants graced the
window ledge. On top of the bookcase I had placed the picture of our vacation, between the
picture of my <a HREF="HBFather.htm">father</a> and <a HREF="HBMoms.htm">her family</a>.
Slowly she turned to me and asked, &quot;Is this real?&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Yes, babe, we can finally be together.&quot; Carefully I steered
her to the couch and helped her sit down. &quot;Would you like some lasagna? John made it
fresh today.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;Maybe later, could you just sit here with me for a few minutes? I
still can't believe it. How did this happen?&quot; I sat close and wrapped an arm around
her. Tears still running she leaned in close and buried her head in my shoulder.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">&quot;After you went to the hospital the commander and I had a long
heart to heart talk. I'll tell you all about it later, let's just say for now that he was
convinced this would be a good idea.&quot;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After a long time she said, &quot;How about some of that lasagna?&quot;
I served it up along with some wine and we ate, mostly in silence. Annie ate slowly, tired
from her injuries and still in shock. After dinner I showed her the other two rooms. The
tiny bathroom with the large old soaker tub I had wedged into it, and finally the bedroom.
She stopped cold again when she saw the king size four poster bed dominating the small
room. Around it I had wrapped a 'welcome home Annie' banner. &quot;It's beautiful! Just
like the one I grew up with.&quot; She wrapped her good arm around me and held me tight.
&quot;I wish I felt up to properly christening it tonight, but I'm still exhausted.&quot;
I helped her undress and we crawled into the bed, wrapping ourselves in each other. She
fell asleep almost at once, I lay awake for long moments, unable to believe this was
finally real. Every so often that night I would wake up, uncertain where I was. Then I
would hear Annie's breathing and smile to myself, it was still real.</p>
