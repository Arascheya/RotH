<p class="pagecaption">Shandi - In the Beginning</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Heart pounding more from fear than from exertion Shandi stopped at the doorway and looked behind her. So far there were no footsteps or shadows following her. She reached a sweaty hand out and pushed the green button. Her heart went into triple time rhythm as she waited impatiently. The call signal for a subway egg-car would register on her father's monitors. It would take only moments until he sent someone to grab her and escort her back to her velvet prison.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Behind the heavy door she heard a faint hissing sound as the car emerged from the vacuum tunnel and was shuffled to the passenger platform. She was ducking and running as soon as the door had slid up enough for her to squeeze under. She dove through the open clam-shell door and into the waiting car where she dropped her pack, planted herself in the control seat, and stabbed a random series of numbers. The "Invalid Code" warning appeared. She drew a shuddering breath as she punched another one.  The egg door hissed shut with a satisfying thump as the car began to move. It slipped gracefully into the waiting airlock, paused while the vacuum was drawn, and then shot into the transit tunnel. As the car sped down the black tunnel she began to relax. The further she could get the less likely he would be able to get his minions to her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She began to worry as the ride continued on longer and longer. She couldn't remember any destinations this far away. Nervousness fought with boredom as the time stretched out. There were no clocks or indicators in the car. All the informational displays had been removed to keep the regular users from gaining more information than absolutely necessary. Once again she cursed her father for his control fetish. He assumed he was the only one with a right to know what was going on. Everyone else was just a pawn in his giant game of cat and mouse.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Conversations with her mom and her mom's friend echoed in her mind. Slowly she brought the pieces of the puzzle together. Her mom didn't approve of her father's games, yet she couldn't oppose him directly. Her friend Stormy was in no better position although as the Mistress of the School of Magic she had resources she could bring in a crisis. Elentaryn, her father, sought to re-establish the civilization of the Ancients through his shell game. He believed he could force civil evolution into his desired path by manipulating the information that was available and the order in which it was gained. Kayara, her mom, and Stormy believed it wouldn't work. Whenever possible it seemed they had pursued their own agenda and methods.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Another half heard conversation intruded into her thoughts. She had been walking past one of the storage rooms beneath the tavern known as Stormy's when she had heard her name. She had slipped closer to listen. Stormy's voice was saying, "Should we tell Shan the truth of it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, it would damage Elentaryn even further. He's unstable enough as it is. Too many more blows to his ego and we won't be able to keep him from doing something really drastic."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But she should know the truth."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"In time. Give her a few more years. When she understands why he can never know then we can tell her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It seems to me it's about time now. He can't keep her wrapped in cotton much longer. She's going to run."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I've been telling him that. At least we got him to let the adventurer family train her a little and we can have her dance here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Footsteps in the passage had forced her to move away before she could hear the rest of it. Still it played in her head now. It was one more piece in the puzzle of her father's slow slide into paranoia. At least that's how it seemed from her viewpoint. That was about the time she decided to run for it. It wasn't that they had planted the seed, but by giving it voice they had firmed her resolve. Something more nagged at her about the conversation but she couldn't quite piece it together. With an impatient shake of her head she tried to go back to thinking about other things.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Thinking about other things reminded her of her current condition. She pulled her pack closer and ran another inventory. It looked like she had remembered all the things she should have. She was short on weapons though. Although it wouldn't matter much because there weren't many she would know how to use anyway. With another sigh she settled back and closed her eyes, hoping maybe she could sleep or something.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A while later the arrival chime awoke her. Uncertain of what to expect she pulled her knife, shouldered her pack, and propped herself to the side of the doors. The car slowed to a stop and the doors swung open.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dusty grey light filtered down a set of cracked and broken stairs. The floor was covered in old leaves, traces of mud, and small animal droppings. A dry breeze puffed in bringing the smells of flowers, dust, and smoke. Gripping her knife tightly she carefully stepped through the door from the platform. Moving slowly and quietly like Aylinn had taught her she crept up the steps.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She emerged into an overgrown garden in the center of a large mud brick building. Delicate archways separated a shaded walkway from the garden and the sky above. Carved wooden screens, showing signs of neglect, screened upper floor windows from the garden and the sun as well. The building was taller to her left, reaching to four floors. The other three walls ended at two floors.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She stood for a few minutes blinking in the bright sunlight. A hot dry breeze puffed around her, just enough to keep the heat in the air from becoming too oppressive. She peered into the gloom of the covered areas, looking for an obvious way to go. When she didn't see one she chose to walk toward the one in front of her. As she neared the covered section she began to notice several doorways leading into the building beyond.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She hesitated at the edge of the shadow and scanned the garden and areas around her once more for threats. Seeing none she walked forward into the shadow and through the first door. A faint almost tickle washed over her as she fell into unconsciousness.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She awoke in a fancy sitting room. The walls were paneled in mahogany. Shelves of books lined the wall to her right. In front of her was an overstuffed chair with a medium height man seated in it. She was startled out of her observations when he spoke. "Good morning Shandi. Sometimes the old simple spells are the best. Take the "Sleep" spell for example. It is so low powered and ordinary that few use it. Yet if you adjust it just a little it becomes quite useful again. Instant unconsciousness followed by instant wakefulness. None of the nasty drowsiness effects of drugs or poison. The target awakes fully aware and quite often rested as well." His face smiled at her but his violet eyes remained cold and aloof. "Ah, but I am being rude. My name is Aztol. I would like to welcome you to my city, although we aren't exactly in it right now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Do I know you?" Shandi tried to stand only to find she was help fast to the large chair she was in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm crushed, you mean that..." he struggled with himself before continuing in a strained voice, "you father," the word was almost hissed, "didn't mention me?" He tried to look hurt but he only managed to look annoyed instead.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, I don't think he did. Why can't I move? Let me up! I'm no threat to you. Please, just let me go."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well now," his composure had restored itself. "I actually would have done that. I like to meet the people stumbling through my garden. It wouldn't be friendly not to. Then I let them continue on their way. You could have as well, it's just that as your father's daughter I thought we should talk. I'm sure there is so much you could tell me..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi struggled against the invisible bonds that held her, pulling and twisting until she sat breathing heavily from the exertion. "Please my dear girl, don't strain yourself. A colleague of mine was quite careful when she cast those restraint spells. I wouldn't want you to muss up that pretty dress you are in."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi stopped and looked down at herself. She was no longer clad in shirt and leggings but instead in a simple white gown. "It's quite lovely don't you think?" Aztol asked conversationally. "It suits a young woman of your beauty so much better than those nasty, sweaty things you were wearing in the garden. I hope you don't mind. I must say though it was rather a chore to fit you. You are so thin for your age. Seems that father of yours isn't a very good parent. Although I'd suspect nothing better of that piece of..." He bit his words off again. "I am truly sorry my dear. Your father and I have had a few disagreements over the years about certain policies. He has made me so very angry."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want from me? Why am I restrained?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I am going to return you to your father of course. I want you to carry a message back to him."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I still don't.."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He eyes looked almost sad as he explained, "It is a very special message. One that says I can get at him were ever and when ever I want. I fear you will be the message. But first we must prepare you for your new role. I almost wish... Well, such youth and innocence, it seems such a waste... But the bastard must pay. I will squeeze his balls until they pop! And you my dear young thing shall be the instrument of my message." Shandi shrank back into her chair in terror as she saw the madness dancing in his eyes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He stood abruptly. "No, you silly girl, I'm not going to kill you. There would be no enjoyment in that. I have other business to attend to. I shall leave you in the tender care of Kaltereth, the arcane colleague I mentioned earlier." He raised his voice slightly, "Kaltereth, my dear, would you be so kind as to show miss revenge to her new rooms? Thank you. I should like to see her at dinner, properly dressed of course."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A thin bent woman moved into her line of view and motioned with her hands. Shandi's arms sprang free and then pulled together tightly in front of her. Her feet came free next only to be closely hobbled by energy bands allowing her to move them about a foot apart at the most. "Come with me." The woman said in a tired voice. As Shandi followed her to the door she looked at her carefully. Kaltereth was thin to the point of emaciated. Her fancy green ball dress hung in loose folds from her shrunken frame. Her hands were cracked and lined with age and wear.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As Shandi stepped out into the ornately paneled corridor faint shrieks echoed in her ears. "What is that horrible sound?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Aztol captured this ship from Ishra, the Demon Queen of the spiders. She fashioned it from the souls of the damned in her realms. If you live here long enough you can almost learn to ignore it, almost..." Kaltereth answered in her lifeless voice.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Twisted fuck!" Kaltereth turned a startled glance on Shandi. Her face was twisted into what might have been a smile if there had been more skin to smile with. For a moment a faint flicker appeared in her tired, dim green eyes. "Yeah, I know the bad words too." Shandi said through a defiant grin.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You just seem so young."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"My father kept me wrapped in cotton and placed on a high shelf. He thought he could keep me safe from damage and the deadly world outside. But I craved adventure, so I fell off the shelf and found a path. I had hoped for dragons and wizards and battles. Looks instead like I found something else. He never understood the damage the shelf and cotton would cause."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry girl, you found your way into a blood feud instead." Kaltereth walked slowly along the passageway giving Shandi plenty of time to study the walls and ceilings. It was opulent and fancy. Rich woods glowed with polish and care. Heavy hangings provided spots of color. Various paintings were carefully framed and hung with a precise eye. Most of them were disturbing abstracts of dark and violent colors swirled together in mad eddies. "Aztol painted them," Kaltereth explained when she saw Shandi studying them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He's mad you know."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Who?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Aztol. He's like my father, driven by a warped dream of how things should be. They both want to sit in their webs and pull the threads of others to make it happen. But it can't happen. What they want won't work with real people."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kaltereth turned and hissed frantically, "The walls have ears. Be careful what you say girl!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, it's not a problem. He knows he's mad and he revels in it. He will return me to my father."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's not that simple."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi turned sad eyes to her and replied, "I know. He is going to damage me first. I could see it in his eyes."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Damn it girl, how can you be so calm?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I have a name you know, at least for a while longer it is mine. I am calm because terror has passed beyond what my mind can handle and I am walking in slow motion now. I could have hysterics, I could fight against your spells, but it won't change anything. My mother always told me a moment of silent inspection can tell you more than an hour of conversation. For example I know you will be doing the damage rather than him."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kaltereth stopped so abruptly that Shandi stumbled into her. She turned and asked through a white face in a very strained voice, "How?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"His mind is too chaotic, like my father's. Now Auntie Stormy, she's like you, calm, deep, an ocean of power waiting to be tapped. Any disturbances are on the surface, waves upon the deep. You will do it for him. What I don't understand is why."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kaltereth managed a shaky laugh as she commented, "You are scary, do you know that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. Like my mother I am random, mercurial, shifting, and unexpected. It is the source of our strength. Sadly I don't have it down yet. I should have done better with asshole, umm Aztol."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He's listening to us. You don't want to make him angry."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He already is angry. I can't change that. It is why he does what he does. It's like you do what you do out of fear and despair. You can escape you know. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but there is always a way out."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I have thought to do that," Kaltereth mentioned slowly as she gave an involuntary glance at her wrist.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That way is too obvious. Starvation is too obvious as well. Make the other person die for their cause as my father would say."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He'll kill me if I try."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You are strong. My mother had visions, mostly as fragments. Auntie Stormy was powerful as well, and my father was mad. I never told mother that I could See. She was always so sad from hers. Too much pain and death. She should have remembered more of the good ones. I See good for you. You will escape and find happiness. I-She will escape as well and find, well, a way...and friends, finally there will be self chosen friends."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, no I'm not strong. He offered knowledge and I came running, just like a puppy for food. I had heard the rumors of his madness and still I came. Then when he continued to hold the offers over my head I hung on his every crumb rather than turn away. I have done his dirty work for years now and I'm still no closer to what I was promised. If I were strong I'd have left long ago."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi cocked her head slightly and said, "Maybe you just need the right reason."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly the air shimmered and tore. The walls shivered and faded into a transparent grey for a brief moment as the howling shrieks rose to a crescendo. As suddenly as it had begun it ended leaving Shandi staring at the walls around her. "That was so pretty. What was it?" she asked in a wondering voice.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We are returning to Aztol's fortress in the other dimensions. He has a palace located outside the normal ways of time. Now there truly is no escape." She stopped speaking as they arrived at a brass studded door of oak. "Here is your suite. I will return for you in time to help you dress for dinner. Your restraints will release once the door is sealed. At least he is letting you be comfortable. Some of his 'guests' he places in the cells below." Kaltereth motioned for Shandi to open and walk through the door.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi stepped into a room from a fantasy story. The walls were covered in gold and velvet cloth. The floor was oak with thick carpets strewn over it. Light came from a multitude of candles in wrought iron holders on the walls. Two arched openings led into more rooms beyond. Pleased even through her terror Shandi slowly walked through the room. The left archway led to an enormous bedroom. The opening to the right revealed the water closet and bathing facilities. The tub could have easily held a small party. Thick towels hung on racks waiting for use.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The suite was quite secure though. As she carefully checked she found no doors or windows, just the single door she had entered through. Finally she gave up the inspection and sat on the bed. She drew in deep steady breaths until she could forget for a few minutes where she was. Images tried to push into her mind but she shoved them out as fast as they came. The struggle went on until the door openned just long enough to allow Kaltereth to enter.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You need to dress now. Dinner will be soon."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I am dressed."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You need to wear something much nicer even than what you have on now. In the armoire there are many choices."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, but only if you start eating again."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What's that got to do with it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You won't be able to leave if you are too weak to do anything."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kaltereth gave a harsh and bitter laugh. "There is no escape."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There is." Shandi reached out and held her hands. "You must believe me. Remember you are strong and we will escape. None of this is your fault. I forgive you. I won't be able to tell you later."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What the hell are you saying?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi gave her a twisted smile, "I fell off the high shelf and now there is no way to land without breaking. I must give way so she may live."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Who? So who can live?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You will meet her once I am gone. Now, will this work for dinner?" Shandi held up a blood red gown trimmed in silver that went nicely with her hair and eyes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, uh, yes, that will work..." Kaltereth answered slowly. Shandi pushed her out of the room, quickly changed, and emerged into the main room again. She followed Kaltereth down the hall to the dining room.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Revenge, you sit here, near me at this end of the table. Kaltereth you may sit next to her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I have a name."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It is not relevant." Shandi held her tongue as she dug into the vast amounts of rich foods placed in front of her. When Aztol wasn't as attentive she would slide the best bits to Kaltereth and watch until she would eat them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I was hoping to begin your preparation, however I find there are other things that must command my attention for the next few days. Kaltereth, you may show revenge back to her rooms."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She loved you, you know." Shandi spoke calmly but clearly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aztol stopped in his tracks. "Whom did?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mirenda, of the bath house. In the city where you first met the dark warrior woman you abandoned on Mintashri 3."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You couldn't know..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In a voice laced with scorn she replied, "I have Seen you. You are no different than my father. You are users, unable to act for yourselves. You are pathetic."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aztol grabbed a meat knife and strode over to Shandi. He raised the knife and plunged it toward her heart. She made no move to stop him. At the very last instant he stopped. Fires of madness danced in his eyes as he hissed out, "Very clever girl, but not clever enough." Breathing heavily and fighting for control he turned to Kaltereth. "Take her to the brain scan and secure her. Then bring the stasis box from the vaults. We will begin tonight after all." He stalked from the room.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Idiot!" Kaltereth snarled.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He must be angry and he must start tonight."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Idiot child," Kaltereth said sadly. "Will you come? Or do I need to bring you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I will come." Shandi followed Kaltereth as she shuffled out the door. She led the way further down the ornate corridor and then into plain iron steps. The shrieking of the hull became louder as they descended the steps. At the bottom was a plain iron corridoar. Turning left Kaltereth moved along to a heavy steel door. Struggling she pulled it open to reveal racks and racks of blinking lights and elaborate technological gear. In the center of the room were two massive chairs. In one was a ebony skinned woman with white hair. Her fine features were slack and her eyes stared sightlessly into the ceiling. A large cap of clear crystal sat on her head. Within it pulsed and swirled lazy patterns of purple motes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"My father has one of these."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aztol stepped around one of the pieces of equipment. "Yes he does. The rat bastard was going to use it on me if I didn't bend to one of his schemes." He motioned to the empty chair. "If you please, revenge. It's easier if Kaltereth doesn't have to put you in for me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi hesitated as the fear clawed through her iron mask of composure. She struggled with herself for long moments and then walked stiffly to the chair. "Get on with it then. You and my father, spineless fools meddling in a universe where you are irrelevant. You forge your undoing this night. Better for you had you killed me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He slipped up to her and stroked her face lightly, "I am going to enjoy what is in store for you. First I am going to bury your intelligence behind a shell of idiocy. Then I will give you terror of magic and technology. That way you won't let your precious father attempt to fix you. Oh, yes, and I will make it almost impossible for you to speak of it, or at all for that matter. I will inject your body with the extracts of various creatures. You will be fast, furios, and deadly. A time bomb waiting to attack anything that threatens you. I will harden you and speed you survive almost anything. And for the last I shall embed a message specially for your father. One last little bomb so you, his darling daughter, will strike him down as the biggest threat to yourself. At last I will squeeze his balls until they pop!" He turned to Kaltereth, "What, are you still here? Where are those supplies you were to bring? Be quick about it!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kaltereth stared in shocked horror at Shandi. It wasn't until she saw her small nod that she could bring herself to stagger out the door. Revulsion sickened her as she picked up the box in shaking hands. Staggering under its weight she threaded her way back through the ship to the chamber once more. Silently she placed it on the table next to Shandi and turned to go.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You will stay," Aztol said as she turned to leave. "I will have need of your skills shortly." He was already at the large console directing the changes to Shandi's brain. With a satisfied sound he turned his attention to the stasis box. It opened to reveal six jars of faintly tinted liquids. Selecting all of them and taking a large syringe from another table he drew up generous quantities of each one. "Cast that maliability spell of yours now. The one that prevents rejection of foriegn tissue."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kaltereth stood motionless until he looked up at her. "Do not block me woman. You would be less use with a Rider Demon attached, but don't think I won't do it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kaltereth stalked forward stiffly and cast the spell. As the energies boiled around Shandi Aztol slammed the injection into the viens in her neck. She writhed in silent agony as it burned its way through her blood. "Now a flesh to etherial spell targetted on her head. If you think to kill her imagine one of my torturers peeling the flesh from your body for days. And remember I have enough healing potion to keep repeating your skinning for as long as I like." Silent tears tracked her face as she cast the second spell. He was smiling as he placed the small demonoid against Shandi's face. As it eased its way inside he chanted over and over, "Now I squeeze his nuts until they pop, the arrogant prick."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi's scream of agony was the last sound Kaltereth heard as she dropped into unconciousness.</p>
