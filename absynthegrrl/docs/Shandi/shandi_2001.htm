<p class="pagecaption">Shandi Chapter 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* REVISE: Shan was not trained in combat during her imprisonment. It is very hard to kill her, but she needs to learn how to fight on her own. Think trailer for latest tomb raider game - learning through adversity instead of starting from advantage - also remember concentrated acid for blood, weaons that injure her will take acid damage, flesh in contact with her blood will take acid damage */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jump, I can't hold the gate for long." Kaltereth's voice echoed in Shandi's ears as she landed in a roll in a dark alley. Behind her there was a faint pop as the gate closed. Her eyes darted around taking in the tall buildings, the brick, stone and dust. She relaxed as she saw the alley was empty of life.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly the awareness faded from her eyes as she slipped back into the almost asleep state she had come to know. With a vacant half smile she began walking down the alley toward the widening out she saw in the distance. She wa half way there when a shadow detached from a nitch and moved to intercept her. "Well now, what do we have here?" The man took in the thin, average height woman in front of him. She was dressed in simple dark loose fitting pants and a tunic. When she slowly turned to look at him she had a blank, vacant look on her face. "Maybe we should have a little fun. What's your name, girlie?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not girl, revenge. I revenge."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What kind of name is that? No matter, we can still have some fun together," he said as he moved closer to her. Her face lit up into a delighted smile as he reached out to slide his hand under her tunic and gave a sharp gasp as pain exploded in his chest. He saw the the woman raise a bloody chunk of meat to her lips and take a big bite out of it as he fell backwards to the stone of the alley. The last words he heard were said in a strangely child-like voice, "I like the heart blood best."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi dropped the remains of his heart on top of his cooling chest and continued her walk down the alley.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* add attack by small group of additional people, this is wher the others come in and "rescue" her - they talk - attacked by three others, two with ranged weapons and the last with a knife - the others see her as this attack begins and they step in */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Instantly she was awake again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider: arrive Vilyanu, the moving city, remember river; meet the party and become attached to them, first by their aiding her; she needs to begin to trust them; they need to want to help her; so after they "save" her, she can save them; someone hires them to perform a task that places them in the middle between two powerful wizards; their research turns up another that can help shan; this would be Margla, who can remove the demon implanted and restore a bit of Shan's speach, she helps because of the prophecy; after this is when Shan begins to learn how to deal with her situation - coffee/stimulants, opium to wind down and rest after long periods of wakefullness, etc.</p>
