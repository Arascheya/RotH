<P>
I had moved again, somehow I couldn't seem to get along with the
room mates I kept getting. The last one had been especially bad,
boys over to all hours, with the usual, &quot;Alex, could you
go to the library for a while?&quot; I had thought psychology
required more study than she gave it. Oh, well, it was as well,
the rest of the dorm wasn't much better.
<P>
They moved me to another building this time. Luckily there were
a few guys from my engineering classes I was able to talk into
helping move my stuff. At least I'd been on campus long enough
that most everyone had seen me enough that they no longer had
to stare.
<P>
I was writing a letter to my parents when my knew roomy arrived.
She was a 5' 6&quot;, slender woman from India, with very serious
dark brown eyes. She was struggling under the weight of a large
mountaineers pack sack and two large soft bags. She saw me, dropped
the bags, smiled and strode over. &quot;Hi, I'm Kalyshivra Rhianon
Smith, but most everybody calls my Lys, it's easier.&quot; She
stuck out one hand formally, then grinned when I took it. &quot;They
said you're an engineering student, is that true? I hope so, I've
been stuck with enough business admin types to last me a lifetime,
but they did know how to party. Didn't leave me any time to keep
up with classes, but enough of that, you are?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Alexandra Yasmine Wells, Alex usually. Yes, I'm an engineering
student, well mostly. I'm on the long term plan, I just can't
avoid the theatre department, or the dance classes. 'To be or
not to be...' and all that! Seriously, tech theatre, NOT acting.&quot;
<P>
We quickly became friends, spending long nights talking and laughing
together. Our skills complemented each other, where I was good
at hands on and intuitive things, she was excellent with math
and theoretical things. She would show up at the theatre when
I was doing stuff for the construction courses and watch. It didn't
take long until I convinced her to volunteer. We became practically
inseparable. As the semester progressed she drifted into the lighting
group, while I concentrated on set design. It wasn't until much
later that I remembered the odd stares some of the students were
giving us.
<P>
There were odd little things going on though. Once in a while
she'd disappear for an evening without saying a word, then slip
in looking furtive and nervous. If I asked about it, she'd blow
me off with a silly answer, then change the subject. Her nervousness
was a tangible feeling in the air.
<P>
One night I came in to find her crying on the phone. When she
saw me she said, &quot;I gotta go anyway, I need to get back to
class work.&quot; When I asked her what had happened she only
said she'd gotten some bad news from a friend. I asked if I could
help. &quot;No, it's nothing you could do anything about anyway.
We should get back to differential equations.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Look, I'm your friend, I'd like to help.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I'll be ok in a little bit. Please don't worry, it was just
a shock, that's all.&quot;
<P>
Her pain beat at my screens the rest of the night, until by bed
time my head was pounding to the beat of my heart. In agony, I
huddled on my bed, trying desperately to relax enough to get to
sleep. Finally Lys moved close and said, &quot;I know some massage
techniques, would you like me to see if I can help?&quot; Desperate
for relief, I quickly agreed.
<P>
I was afraid her pain would be overwhelming when she touched me.
Instead I felt a brief burst of it, then calmness and soothing
energies radiated outward from her fingers as her hands moved
skillfully over my upper back and shoulders, kneading pain and
tension from my muscles. When she worked on my neck and temples
I melted into the bed, drifting into a troubled sleep. Everywhere
I turned in my dreams I was being tickled by something, just beyond
my range of vision. I'd spin to look at it, but it'd dance away.

<P>
Sunday before the end of spring quarter I was studying for finals
while Lys had disappeared again. I was restless, I couldn't have
explained it if I had to. Something was eating at me. Unable to
concentrate on differential equations any longer, a low growl
escaped my lips as I paced to the door. With a final frustrated
glance I snagged my cloak and headed out for a much needed walk
through the late night campus.
<P>
I was stalking toward the far edges when anger and fear, followed
by PAIN, slammed through my head, dropping me to my knees. I hadn't
had anything punch through me that hard since Aubrey had taught
me how to shield. The pain flashed again, along with something
else, I HAD to help, the feelings underneath were too familiar
to ignore it. Drawn like a puppy on a chain I staggered toward
the feelings. Staggering, then running, I headed away from campus,
past frat row, and into the nearby neighborhood.
<P>
Rounding a corner I saw four toughs kicking a downed cyclist.
&quot;We'll teach your kind not to come here. You won't infect
us. Soon we'll cleanse you all with fire.&quot; Another kick crashed
into the figure's ribs and I gasped as pain lanced through my
side. Rage flared as red painted the scene. I remember shedding
my cloak and running, only afterward did I realize what else had
happened.
<P>
Running on silent feet I leapt into the fray. The first one died
without a sound as I snapped his neck. The second one took my
elbow in the throat then my fist between the eyes, gurgling and
wheezing, he dropped. The third one opened his mouth to scream,
but his torn throat would make no sound. Number four was the luckiest
of all, he managed to run.
<P>
Sharp, hot agony pounded through my head, then suddenly stopped,
leaving a cold emptiness that closed in black waves over me. A
short time later someone was shaking me. &quot;Ali, come on, wake
up, we gotta get out of here, quickly!&quot; The cyclist continued
to push and pull at me, urging me up and helping me into the shadows.
<P>
Still confused, I tried to make sense of the words. An intelligent
&quot;Huh&quot;, escaped my lips as the cyclist removed her helmet,
shaking out long waves of midnight hair. &quot;Lys, what're you
doing here? What's happening?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Wait here!&quot; Still too wobbly to move, I stayed leaning
against the wall. Quickly she ran to the street, grabbed her bike,
and retreated to join me once more, grabbing my cloak as she passed
it. &quot;Come on, we gotta get out of here before anyone comes.&quot;
Silently we slipped through shadowy alleys until we arrived at
the back of a large house.  In the distance I heard sirens growing
closer. &quot;Wait here, I need to go in the front, I'll be right
back.&quot; Reaction hit while she was inside. One moment I was
calm and detached, the next I was shaking and throwing up, frantically
rubbing my hands on my cloak, trying to rub the blood away. I
was still shaking when the door opened and she directed me into
a narrow hallway.
<P>
Concern filled her eyes as she helped me sit on the stairs, then
held me while the shaking subsided. &quot;I do volunteer work
with the local AIDS support group and was on my way here to deliver
food when I was ambushed. Usually I can take care of myself, but
they hit me with something from behind before I saw them.&quot;
As she babbled I kept replaying my attacks over and over, trying
to imagine why I'd gotten pumped up so quickly. Father, grandfather,
and others had warned me over and over again about the beast part
of us, yet I'd never felt it come on that quickly, or so strongly
ever before. She must have finally noticed my distraction as she
said, &quot;You haven't heard anything I've said have you?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Ummm, no Lys, uh...sorry .. no...&quot;
<P>
&quot;Hey, it's ok. You've never done that before have you?&quot;
I shook my head no. &quot;Ever seen anyone die?&quot; Again a
head shake no. &quot;I have, when I was a kid I saw lots of death
in my village in India. It's just another part of life, everything
in its time must pass on. You have merely helped those three along,
maybe next time they'll progress farther on the path of life.&quot;
She paused for a moment, then continued, &quot;Did you enjoy killing
them? Did it make you feel good?&quot; She must have seen the
horror on my face at her questions. &quot;You didn't, that is
well, you have nothing to fear.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I don't ever want to do that again!&quot; Tears leaked from
my eyes as the shakes started again. Her arms held me tight while
I cried it out.
<P>
&quot;I don't think you will, but if you do it will be for the
same reasons as this time, to save another.&quot; For long moments
I was content to let her peace and warmth fill me, then my brain
started up again. With a start I sat back, breaking out of her
hold. Fear chased through me. Concern clouded her eyes as she
asked what was wrong.
<P>
&quot;Nothing, I just realized how late it's getting, I've got
to get home.&quot; Frantic I started to my feet.
<P>
&quot;It is late, which brings up what were you doing down here
anyway?&quot;
<P>
&quot;I...don't..really..know....I was restless and went for a
walk, then I was seized by a need to be here...I wish I could
explain it better, but...&quot; Confused, my voice trailed off,
echoing the confusion I felt inside. I had a very definite feeling
of what it could have been, but before it could fully form, I
shoved it back and down hard, slamming doors and screens between
it and me. Her eyes watched me curiously until I was finished.
<P>
&quot;What was that all about?&quot;
<P>
&quot;What was what about?&quot; She couldn't possibly have known
what I was doing, could she?
<P>
&quot;Never mind. We'd best get back, morning comes awfully early.&quot;
With another intense look she helped me up and out into the alley.
<P>
&quot;Here, get on, I'll give you a ride...&quot;
<P>
&quot;I don't want to inconvenience you, I'll be fine, really...&quot;
<P>
&quot;Come on roomy, get on.&quot; She was already pulling me
onto the bike behind her. I must have still been in shock, everything
had an intensity and clarity I'd never seen before. Sounds were
more distinct and scents where overwhelming, yet sharply separate.
In a fog of sensory overload I clung to her as we roared back
to campus. <BR>

<P>
Morning came but I was still exhausted from the tossings and turnings
of the night. Every time I dozed off I could see the fear etched
in the boys' faces, then feel the agonies of their deaths. I gave
up around six AM and dragged myself out of bed. I buried myself
in the studying I'd neglected the night before, yet I couldn't
completely silence the restlessness from before. I flitted from
course to course chased by an inability to concentrate fully.
Finally I gave up and headed for breakfast after packing my books
for exams.
<P>
All through the day I expected to have someone come and haul me
away. I couldn't imagine why the police never did show up. Later
in the day I grabbed one of the local papers and looked for a
story on the three deaths. I found nothing, not even in the police
blotter section. Puzzled, I parked myself at the campus center
and subjected myself to as many news programs as I could, still
nothing.
<P>
That evening found me back in my room trying once more to study.
I was doing all right until Lys wandered in, then nameless emotions
flared and surged. Ashamed and frightened I dashed for the door,
&quot;Uh, I need to do some studying in the library, I'll see
you later.&quot; Her puzzled look etched itself in my memory as
I hurried past her.
<P>
The next days found me avoiding our room. Mornings I left early
and nights I slipped in as late as I could. Every so often I'd
see her confused face in a crowd between classes. Whenever she
was near I could feel her confusion and hurt. Sometimes there
was more, a deep sadness and despair. Once, late at night, I was
awake when she came in, then it was a fleeting image of me through
her eyes, as we battered each other with pillows. There was warmth
immediately overlaid with sorrow and tears. The week dragged like
centuries until, finally, I was on the plane home.
<P>
The first day back started wonderfully. Cat and Vincent were there,
along with grandfather and several others. We were sitting catching
up on things when I started getting uneasy. It was a faint feeling
of fear and panic that quickly faded away. &quot;Alex, are you
ok?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Sure dad, it's nothing really, just a bit distracted still
from traveling.&quot; Every so often during the day the feeling
would gnaw at me, faintly, never long enough to really figure
it out. It continued to intrude, growing slowly more constant
as the weekend continued. By Sunday night it was a constant distraction,
everyone had to call my name many times to get my attention. Finally
dad looked at me and asked, &quot;So, when do we get to meet him?&quot;
<P>
&quot;WHAT??&quot;
<P>
&quot;I've seen enough bonding over the years to recognize the
symptoms in my daughter. Come on young lady, tell us about him,
is he good enough for you?&quot;
<P>
Fear exploded in my head as I ran for the depths. Dodging and
twisting I fled deep, running till the sounds of pursuit died
down, then running some more. At long last I slowed to a walk
and slipped toward a far chamber I'd found accidentally when I
was younger.
<P>
I sat staring at the wall for a very long time, lost in thought.
/It couldn't be, I couldn't be linked, no, I was just feeling
good about having a friend and roommate to talk to. If I was linked
then I was...no, that never happened in our family. I couldn't
be.../ Images cascaded through my head, Lys sitting at her desk,
laughing at a joke, pillow fighting, talking long into the night,
each time I would shove an image away, another would pop into
it's place. Head pounding from the effort, I headed toward Mary
Elizabeth's home. Maybe I could talk to her, she was a psychological
nurse, maybe she could help me with this. One last image intruded
as I hurried along, the smell of Lys' hair the night she was attacked,
jasmine and faint spices.../NO, I won't think of this any more,
I'm just stressed, my shields slipped and I am feeling someone
else's wants.../ Suddenly I changed direction and headed toward
Aubrey's instead.
<P>
&quot;Aunt Aubrey, I need help. My shields have slipped, I'm getting
all sorts of weird needs and feelings, could you screen me for
a few minutes until I can get mine back on-line?&quot;
<P>
She had been going to read me the riot act for waking her so late,
but one look at my white, teary face stopped her cold. In moments
we were in her working room with candles and incense going. It
took her a few short minutes to raise the protective screen and
immediately I felt the background noise fade below my level of
perception. Panic twisted my guts, the feelings intensified as
the noise dropped. &quot;Something's not right...&quot; I began.
<P>
Aubrey's look pierced deep as she said, &quot;No, those are your
feelings, nothing else is getting anywhere near you.&quot; She
let me relax in the field, as much as I could, for long moments
then said, &quot;I'm going to ease the screens off, you'll need
to rebuild yours. I've done all I can for you, I'm sorry you're
still hurting. Do you want to talk?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Aubrey, I...I don't know what to say, I don't know what
to think....what's it like when you bond?&quot; Hope flared as
I waited for her description to give the lie to my feelings.
<P>
&quot;It's wonderful! You  feel the other's emotions, sometimes
bits of their thoughts and wants, their love and caring. I ...
words can't do it justice, but it's unmistakable, you just KNOW.
Why? Do you think you've bonded, is that it? Alex, that's wonderful
... isn't it?&quot; Her voice wound down at the terror etched
on my face. &quot;What is it? Alex, you've got to tell someone,
please!&quot;
<P>
&quot;I...think...I've bonded...&quot; the deadness in my voice
drained the blood from her face.
<P>
&quot;I don't understand...&quot;
<P>
&quot;I've bonded to a WOMAN.&quot; Hysteria tinged my voice as
all the images and feelings I'd worked to bury emerged in a blinding
flash of swirling emotions. &quot;I can't stop thinking of her,
but how..can..I..bond..to.....to a..WOMAN????? I don't want to
be different. It's not FAIR!&quot; Sobs wracked my body as I curled
into a ball on her floor. I could feel her shock warring with
her compassion as she held me. &quot;I can't go back, I can't
face her again,&quot; another thought slammed into my abused consciousness,
&quot;Oh goddess, what about my parents? What can I tell my parents?
What can I do?&quot;
<P>
&quot;You might talk to them, they're not ogres you know. You
might talk to Jeremy or Mary Elizabeth too. Maybe they can help
you work through this.&quot;
<P>
Slowly I made my way home. My parents greeted me at the door with
hugs and, &quot;We were worried, are you all right?&quot; I could
feel their curiosity, but they didn't say anything. We talked
of neutral things until it was time for bed. Sleep was a long
time coming that night. Images of the fun Lys and I had together
bounced against images of my parents and the other bondmates I'd
seen. I had always thought I would bond and start a family, just
like my parents. I'd never seen any man I'd found attractive,
but I had always thought I hadn't met the right one. Finally I
drifted into a restless sleep.
<P>
Early in the morning I was jarred wide awake as terror swept through
me, then quickly faded back into the vague uneasiness. Unable
to return to sleep I made my way into the kitchen and started
fixing breakfast. Mom found me puttering around a bit later. &quot;Anything
you'd like to talk about?&quot;
<P>
&quot;No.&quot; The hurt in her eyes burned deep. &quot;Please,
not right now...I need to think it through a bit more first.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Ok.&quot; Her neutral voice carried none of the pain that
beat at my shields as she returned to her preparations for the
day. I slipped out before dad showed up and went and camped on
Mary Elizabeth's door.
<P>
I paced and prowled until she showed up, then urgently I pleaded
with her, &quot;Mary, I need your help. I need to talk to someone,
but I'm not ready to face my parents. Please, can I squeak in
sometime soon today?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, I'm pretty busy, but I might have a cancellation in
my first slot, but you'll just have to hang around until we know.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Sure, no problem, thanks!&quot;
<P>
I spent a nervous eternity in her waiting room until it was obvious
her first appointment really wasn't going to show. The I hurried
in and sat down, playing with a coil of my hair. &quot;Ok, what's
wrong Alex?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Uh, I, uh ....&quot;
<P>
&quot;It's ok, I'm a trained professional, remember?&quot; That
got a giggle out of me, granted it was a bit hysterical, but it
did break the fear a bit.
<P>
Head down I quickly mumbled, &quot;Um, I've...I've bonded to a
woman.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I didn't quite get all that...&quot;
<P>
&quot;I said I think I've bonded to a woman.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Is that a problem?&quot; Her honest puzzlement brought my
head up. I found hr watching me curiously.
<P>
&quot;YES! At least I think so...it's not fair!&quot;
<P>
&quot;What do you mean, it's not fair?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Everyone else has bonded to men. I've always figured I just
hadn't met the right one, but that I would, and we'd do the whole
route, just like the rest of the family. Now nothing's going to
work that way. I don't know anyone like me, I've heard of them,
everyone has, but..oh I don't know..and what about Lys, what if
she's not this way?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Are you sure you've bonded?&quot; I described everything
I was feeling, including how much I was always thinking of Lys.
&quot;Hm, it does sound like bonding, doesn't it?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Yes,&quot; I sighed, &quot;It feels like what I've heard
...&quot;
<P>
&quot;Ok, I'd like you to try and answer a few questions as truthfully
as possible, take your time and think about them first. Do you
find women attractive?&quot;
<P>
I sat and stared at her, then at the floor. My mind skipped and
slid around, trying to avoid her question. I wanted to say no,
but couldn't shake memories of watching several girls during high
school as well as Lys. &quot;Yes...&quot; I replied in a very
small voice.
<P>
&quot;OK, how about men? Do you find men attractive?&quot; Once
again I searched through memories, finding none, not even Allen,
who'd taken me to my junior and senior proms. &quot;Um...no...none
yet...&quot; I whispered.
<P>
&quot;There's a couple of things I want you to do. First I want
you to try saying the word 'lesbian' and I want you to think about
the reactions you have to it. Then I want you to think about those
reactions. You need to start asking yourself why you're reacting
this way. Are you afraid of what other people will say, or are
you scared of homosexuals? No, don't try and answer me right now,
think about it and come see me tomorrow.
<P>
What you need to do now is start dealing with yourself. It's always
difficult when you find out you're not like you thought you were.
If you can face the thought, go through our library and read something
about it, try and build an understanding in yourself. If you can,
write down and think about the things that make you nervous, scared,
or even happy, and we'll talk more tomorrow. Before you leave
for school I'll find some names of people you can talk to when
you get back, this isn't going to magically solve itself in the
next few days.
<P>
What I want you to realize is this is not an illness, so there
is no magic 'cure', it's just one aspect of you, part of who you
are. As for Lys, well, it's a risk, but I've never seen a bonding
happen where there wasn't compatibility, so I would bet most anything
you'd like that she is lesbian also, even if she's not aware of
it yet. You don't always just know. I've worked with several women
who had thought they were heterosexual until they fell in love
with another woman, so I don't think I'd worry as much about her
right now.&quot;<BR>

<P>
I slowly headed home. I still couldn't shake the vague uneasiness,
in fact it was slowly growing stronger as the day wore on.
<P>
I felt mom's questions before I walked in, yet as she saw me,
she damped them down. I could still see them in her eyes as she
handed me an envelope, handwritten, with no return address. Puzzled,
I ripped it open and scanned the short note.
<P>

<P>
 Ali,
<P>
    Just so you know, I got your address from a letter  you'd
left on your desk. I'm sorry for invading your area like that,
but I needed to write you.
<P>
    I don't know what I've done to make you so afraid of me, but
whatever it is, I'm very sorry it happened. I never wanted to
do anything to hurt you, I like you far too much.
<P>
    I've put in for another dorm assignment so you won't have
to face me when you get back. It hurts too much to feel your fear
and tension whenever I'm around. If you really want to find out
where I am, I'll leave word at the engineering office if you get
back early. If not I'll see you in classes.
<P>
    Please, I hope there is some way we can still be friends.
<P>
 Lys<BR>

<P>
I read her letter over and over trying to figure out how I felt.
The thought of her being gone ripped a hole somewhere deep inside
me. All I could remember were the good times we'd had together.
Now there was this thing inside me. How could I face her with
it? How could I be around her, knowing that I wanted far more
than her friendship? It wouldn't be fair to her, yet I still couldn't
quit thinking of her. Tears blurred the page as I tried to read
it again. &quot;Baby, what is it? Please, tell me, let me help.&quot;

<P>
Suddenly the dam burst. &quot;I met this girl, my room mate actually,
we get along so well, we're best friends, we've done everything
together this last semester, I know what she's thinking, how she's
feeling, I can't stop thinking of her...it's her that dad thinks
I've bonded to, and I'm afraid because he's right, and I can't
imagine her not being around, yet I don't know how to be around
her...&quot; Words and feelings poured out in a jumble of half
sentences and fragments. One moment I was talking of feelings,
the next of images, the next of fears. At last most of it was
out in a jumble. Mom and I had somehow moved to the couch and
were sitting together, my head on her shoulder, just like when
I was younger. &quot;...and she feels me too, all my fear and
uncertainty, and now she's leaving, and I don't know what I'll
do without her....&quot; My voice broke as sobs wracked my body.
Mom's hand stroked my hair as she murmured encouragements until
I stopped shuddering.
<P>
As I calmed down I felt her twitching lightly. Frightened, I pulled
back and looked at her, she was trying hard not to laugh. Feeling
as if I'd been slapped, I tried to pull away. &quot;I know it's
not funny, but we were so afraid you had something terrible to
tell us, like you'd flunked out, or something...It doesn't matter
who you love, as long as you DO love them, and it sounds like
you love this person very much. Call her now, before it's too
late! Don't let her go, you'll never forgive yourself if you do.&quot;
<P>
I moved to the phone and punched in the numbers. It rang and then
the answering machine picked up the line. My unease grew as I
put the receiver down. Fumbling through my belt pouch I finally
found the number for the engineering office. My nervousness increased
as I listened to the rings. Just as I was about to give up, a
male voice answered, &quot;Engineering office.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Hi, my name is Alexandra Wells...&quot;
<P>
&quot;Alex, hi, this is Terry. How's your break going?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Uh, ok. Could you do me a favor and look around for a message
from Lys, she said she might leave me one there.&quot;
<P>
I heard shuffling papers and muttered words, then, &quot;No, I'm
not finding one. Is everything all right? Last time I saw Lys
she looked pretty bad.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Bad, how?&quot; Intensity crackled in my voice while my
knuckles went white on the receiver at his words.
<P>
&quot;Oh just despondent and distracted. Why do you ask?&quot;
<P>
&quot;I just need to talk to her, that's all. When did you last
see her?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Let's see, a couple of days ago, maybe three...Um, I don't
know how to say this, but some of the guys are wondering about
you two. A couple of them have heard rumors about Lys liking women
and they're worried, you know...&quot;
<P>
&quot;No, I don't know. So what if she likes women, what's so
bad about that? Now, is that all the better you can do, two or
three days?&quot; /Shit, I'd just started to have to deal with
this and already I was having to defend us./
<P>
&quot;I'm afraid so. Now I've heard the statistics and all, and
I know it's not always a choice, and I can respect that, but it's
still a shame when someone as pretty as Lys or you turns out that
way.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Terry! I'm not a piece of meat...&quot;
<P>
&quot;Damn, that's not what I meant, they're just not sure how
they're supposed to deal with someone who's like that. Not that
I'm saying either one of you is, you know.&quot;
<P>
Nervous fear was eating at me and his thinly veiled innuendoes
were beginning to annoy me. Finally I had enough, &quot;Well,
I'm sorry to disappoint all of you, but we are lovers.&quot; I
hung up during his stunned silence. &quot;Oh goddess, I can't
believe I said that.&quot; Giggling, I caught a glimpse of my
mom's startled face. She was having a hard time not laughing either.

<P>
Fear quickly clenched my guts again as I dialed the housing office.
&quot;Uh hi, my name is Alexandra Wells, and I room with Kalyshivra
Smith. She recently put in a request for a new room. I'd like
to ask that you not assign me a new room mate until I have a chance
to talk with her. The situation was over a foolish disagreement...&quot;
<P>
&quot;Excuse me, Ms. Wells, I don't see any requests for changes
in your rooming status. There is nothing on file from Ms. Smith
other than her housing contract for this semester.&quot;
<P>
My voice was shaking as I apologized and hung up. White faced
I turned to mom, &quot;I've got to get back. I don't know how
I'm going to deal with me, but Lys is in trouble, I know it now.&quot;
<P>
She helped me throw my things together and then drove me to the
airport. &quot;Don't worry, we'll see you again for the summer,
and I'll tell your father why you left. Would you want me to explain
it all, or make something up?&quot;
<P>
She was so serious I couldn't help laughing. &quot;Go ahead and
tell him, although it'd be fun to see what you'd make up.&quot;
<P>
The flight was horrible. I spent the entire time perched forward
on my seat, willing the plane to fly faster. The taxi ride to
campus was even worse. Traffic was at it's usual standstill through
the downtown core, then there was fighting traffic into the U
District, at least it was still break so the student crush was
reduced.
<P>
I ran to our room, dumped my stuff on the bed and tore the room
apart. I looked for notes everywhere. Nothing was out of place
or moved, just no sign of Lys. I concentrated and dropped my shields
a bit. She hadn't been around recently. As I strengthened them
back up I got a brief flare of fear and a wavering image of a
dimly lit room. I grabbed for it, only for it to slip away. The
harder I tried the less I could even remember. Frantically I paced
the room then ran down to the garage, her bike was still there.

<P>
I stood absolutely still for long moments then was off again,
running toward Terry's room. I charged up the stairs and hammered
on his door. With each bang the door shivered in its frame. Finally
the door opened to a very sleepy looking Terry. &quot;When did
you last see her? Where was she?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Huh, who?&quot; He asked as he struggled out of sleep.
<P>
&quot;Lys! where did you last see her?&quot; With a quick shove
I was in the room, glancing at the lump hiding in the bed. &quot;Come
on Terry, WHERE??&quot; Only at the last moment did his terror
pierce my rage and show me how close to the edge I really was.
With a massive shake of my head I collapsed on the edge of the
bed and said as calmly as I could, &quot;Shit, I'm sorry Terry,
could you please tell me where you last saw her. She's in some
kind of trouble and I've got to find her.&quot;
<P>
Shaking, he replied, &quot;Near..near the fountain, Friday morning.
I saw her near the fountain Friday morning.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Did anyone else see her?&quot;
<P>
&quot;How should I...&quot; My look stopped him for a moment.
&quot;No, not that I know of, but I only saw her walking toward
upper campus.&quot; With a frustrated snarl I turned and stalked
out. /Who else might have seen her? No, wait, I can't keep stalking
campus this way, I'll rip someone's head off for sure./ I hurried
back to my room to try and calm down. As I shoved my key into
the lock I was hit with a wave of panic. After the first moments
I tried to figure what direction it came from and got north.
<P>
I hit the stairs at a run, leaping from landing to landing, then
slammed through the door. I sped off campus and north, running
as fast as I could, until the panic began to fade into a muddled
fuzziness. With a last burst I sprinted in the direction of the
last feelings, then they were gone.
<P>
I was just able to feel Lys, if I relaxed and let my mind drift.
I just about had the right direction when a police car pulled
up. &quot;A long way from campus, aren't you, Ms. Wells.&quot;
Startled, I looked up. &quot; It might be safer if you returned
there, some of the people in this neighborhood are a bit wary
of strangers and we wouldn't want to respond to an injury incident.
You are a rather uniquely identifiable individual and a bit startling
to those who might not know you.. We would be glad to give you
a lift back to fiftieth.&quot;
<P>
I opened my mouth to protest, thought better of it, and replied,
&quot;I did get a bit farther with my run than I thought. Thanks
for the offer, but I wouldn't want to trouble you.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Oh, no trouble at all.&quot;
<P>
Reluctantly I climbed into the police cruiser and headed back
to the U District. Sitting in the back I reached out again and
got a reasonable idea of which direction I needed to go from where
I had been picked up. After dropping me off they cruised slowly
away. I slowly walked toward campus, noticing they came back around
to watch my direction.
<P>
I paced and prowled until nightfall, then grabbed my cloak and
headed out. I stuck to the alleys and side streets, slowly working
my way back to where I had been, then felt my way farther north
and a little east. After an hour of walking I had narrowed in
on a large, rundown house in the middle of a block. I slipped
into the alley and crept along the shadows until I was behind
it then sought for Lys. I stood in the shadows considering my
options. I wanted to rush in, free Lys and tear her captors apart,
yet that would leave several unexplained deaths. I could go to
the police, but I had no hard evidence she was a captive, let
alone even there. If I did nothing I had no way of knowing what
was going to happen to her next. Suddenly light flashed in my
eyes as a car pulled up in the alley. A quick diving roll took
me out of the light and into the shadow of three trash cans. As
I blinked trying to clear my vision I heard the car door open,
then shut and footsteps crunch in the gravel. A flashlight beam
began searching the darkness around the car. &quot;I know you're
there, come out quietly and I won't hurt you.&quot; Eyes still
watering I could make out a shadowy shape pointing something along
the flashlight beam. The voice was almost familiar, I puzzled
at it while I tried to shift deeper into the shadows. Then I had
it, it was one of Lys' attackers, the one who'd managed to get
away. Carefully I edged through shadow toward him, as I gathered
for a quick leap something rolled beneath my foot, clinking against
a rock. As he whirled I leapt. He tried to swing the gun onto
me but I was just a little quicker. I hit him full on, driving
him to the ground under me and momentarily stunning him. With
a quick swipe I ripped the gun out of his hand, not caring if
his fingers broke. His terror filled gaze looked up at me while
he struggled for breath. &quot;Make any loud sound and you die
like your friends.&quot;
<P>
&quot;What do you want?&quot; I was proud of him. He'd managed
to sound terrorized and still whisper.
<P>
&quot;Not much. Your friends have a friend of mine held hostage
in there. I want you to go call the police and turn yourself and
them in for kidnapping. While we're going to find a phone you
can tell my why you grabbed her and practice what you'll say to
the police.&quot; I kept one hand firmly tangled in his clothes
and rested the other one lightly on his neck with my claws just
pressing his skin. I quick marched him down quiet streets toward
a small market where I thought there might be a phone. He started
talking, reluctantly at first. Only the thought that he was Lys'
ticket out kept me from ripping his throat out when I heard why
they'd grabbed her. They had planned on giving her a spectacular,
flaming death on Capital Hill this coming weekend.
<P>
Within moments of his call 3 police cruisers arrived. After extensive
questioning of the informant we headed quietly back to he house.
We arrived in the area just as the SWAT unit pulled up. Within
moments the informant had once more gone over the layout and the
SWAT team headed in. Quickly and quietly they entered the building
and, after an eternity of waiting, they began bringing out the
other people involved. Last to emerge was a very shaken Lys, being
helped along by one of the SWAT team. When she saw me she paused,
fear and anguish swept over me in waves. I was barely able to
see through my tears as I moved to her, wrapped my arms around
her, and held on for dear life. Emotions exploded through both
of us. Uncertainty, fear, love, warmth coursed through my head,
mingling with her confusion, disbelief, hope, and happiness. I
wasn't sure what to do next, so she decided. She pulled my face
to hers and kissed me. &quot;When you two come back to earth you
might want to go sit in one of the cars, before you fall down.&quot;
It took the policeman's words to remind us of how tired she was.

<P>
I helped her to our room, pulled the mattresses off the miniature
dorm beds, spread blankets on them, and helped her under the covers.
She was asleep before I had the covers pulled up over her. Moments
later I joined her, curling myself protectively around her. I
lay awake long moments, enjoying the feel of her next to me and
trying not to think of all the stuff I still needed to work through.
I just knew I didn't want to lose her again.<BR>
