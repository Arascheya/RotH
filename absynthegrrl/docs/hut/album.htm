<p class="pagecaption">Hut Snapshot Album</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These are various candid photos taken of the Hut crew and others. There is no particular order to the layout of these, consider them to be loose in a rtandom stack on a table somewhere in the common areas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Possibilities */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Krys - home in the brothel */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">/* description of living and enetertaining areas - another photo would be the circumstances around Krys leaving - another would be her adoptive mom finding her and bringing her "home" */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Alexandra watching Irena and Yara meet */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">/* while the troup is resting in the void during a voyage from one world to another - the fires are lit, the vardos circled, and music and dancing have started */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* discussing the need for a Tac Team/Intell Force */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">They were gathered in the crew lounge, seated in their chairs, circling the inscribed pentagram. "We need to recruit a tactical team we can send into the more complicated situations," Irena said.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Why? Can't you pick up what we need with the omniscience you have as the Balance Keeper?" Krystal asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Omniscience is a three edged weapon. Too much and I can't sort the falling leaf from the dying planet. Too little and I lose the big picture. The third edge is any sentient can alter what is happening by their actions as well. A small group of trained beings could slip in, research potential recruits, scan the locale for issues, and conver up any recruitment. It would free us up to deal with the bigger issues."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Aztol - either shortly before or shortly after aquiring the Spider Ship */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"The leader is being clever, staying out of sight or in large groups of retainers. An assassination won't be easy to achieve," Krystal reported.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"The solution is simple. We kill the leaders, then kill the next ones to take charge. We keep doing this until we get a leadership we can use or until there are none left. In either case, we have access to what we want," Aztol answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"But what about the innocents?" Krystal asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Innocents? That's a laugh. All of them are guilty of something, besides, humans breed like rabbits. Why should we care about a few that get in the way? There are always plenty more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Irena and the main crew discussing terminating a rogue operator */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"His actions are unbalancing that entire sector," Krys reported.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"What happened when you talked to him about it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"I was ignored," Kara answered. "I vote for termination."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Does this instance have multiple crew members and have they been assessed?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"There are two others. Assessment was difficult and inconclusive. They seem unwilling to state their own positions."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">/* need to think through how this works - what happens during an instance termination? Is there a way to remove crew members other than the instance holder before the termination? Is it an easy process? Can it be done from the master or does it require on-site interference? */</p>
