<p class="pagecaption">Kyira - With Shandi</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She was sitting in the back of the Miner’s Rest waiting for Ayesha when the woman walked in. Immediately all the heads in the room turned to stare. She was five foot six and dressed in some type of leather and metal armor. It looked like some of the stuff Kyira had seen in fantasy entertainment holos.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The woman quickly scanned the room and moved toward the back where Kyira was. With a quick half smile that didn’t come close to her eyes she motioned to the chair next to her and spoke in an odd manner. Her words were clipped and jerky, as if forced through a voice that was not used often, "I sit? Can’t sit...back to room" With a wary look Kyira motioned ok. She was about to ask where this strange woman had come from until she saw the look in her eyes. Instead she offered her a drink. "Strongest coffee." A motion from Kyira’s hand brought the server over and soon a mug of coffee appeared on the table.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They sat in silence for a while until a group of company security strode in. As a group they moved toward the two women. The leader spoke as he reached them, "Kyira Nysvahral I have a warrant for your arrest. Stand up and come with us."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The woman spoke before Kyira could move, "You interrupting, go away"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We are company security, you don’t just tell us to go away. Show me your identicard."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What identicard?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, a smartass. You will come with us." He motioned to the two men who had moved behind her. "Bring her with the other one." As they reached to pull her from her seat, she exploded into motion. A spring back and up carried her over their heads and into a crouch behind them. Another spring brought her up as her feet shot out kicking the two face down on the table. They landed hard as she landed and leapt again, this time toward the commander. Her right hand flashed out and blood spurted from his ruptured eyes. He dropped screaming as the last two tried to bring their blasters up. They were far too slow. Her roll through brought her up in front of them as her hands flashed again. Their weapons flew half way across the bar as they staggered back, fingers broken and twisted. Once more her hands flashed and they dropped as one, clawing at their throats, and gasping for air.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dark purple muscle cords slowly subsided in her arms as she turned to Kyira. Not even breathing hard she said, "This trouble...we go...now." Kyira stood stunned until the woman began pulling her toward the bar. "Out back way." Kyira stumbled after her as she moved around the bar and headed into the back. A server was about to stop them until she saw the knife in the woman’s hand and backed away. She held out a shaking hand as Kyira moved by her, "This message just came in for you." Kyira grabbed the envelope as she hurried by.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She stopped just inside the back door and listened, motioning Kyira back the way the door would swing. She moved to the other side as it swung open. Her right hand snapped up, grabbing a man by the chin and hauling him into the room. Her left hand flashed behind him, embedding the knife in the person following him in.
Once they cleared the back door the woman stopped and looked around. Figures were moving at both ends of the alley. With a twitch of her head she motioned to the fire escape from the building above the bar. An effortless spring took her to the bottom rungs. Her weight pulled it down where Kyira could grab on. She started up fast while Kyira struggled along behind her. Swiftly she swung out and climbed down the side of the ladder to where she could get next to Kyira. Then she reached over and helped her move up more quickly. On the roof the woman stopped and made a quick scan of the surroundings, giving Kyira time to tear open the envelope. Inside it was a data pack wrapped in a single line note. She was about to read it when the woman asked, "Where we? Where safe?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kyira thought quickly then took off across the rooftops, heading back toward the warehouse section of town. She scanned the note as she moved. It was quick and to the point, saying only, "Main port, bay 6, Ghost Wind, dusk - Ayesha." They made it halfway on the rooftops before coming to a section of wide streets and spaces that forced them back to the ground. Dodging through alleys and staying away from as many open spaces as they could they slipped back to into the warehouse Kyira and Ayesha had left earlier in the day. Once they were safely hidden in the dark Kyira turned to the woman, "Who you are and why you are dressed that way?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dressed what way? I Shandi, you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I am Kyira. Where are you from?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not know, appeared front bar. Need find Arcane."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A what?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Arcane. Magic user. Need find way home."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don’t know what you are talking about, but I have passage on a starship out of here tonight. Maybe you can arrange passage with them to somewhere closer to where you need to be." Kyira tried to get more information from Shandi as the morning wore on, but eventually gave up when Shandi couldn’t add any more details. She passed the rest of the day drifting in and out of sleep, disturbed by Shandi’s restlessness.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At long last evening arrived. Carefully they worked their way toward the main port area. They were almost to it when a scream from a side alley caught their attention. "Get her. No you fool, we need her alive. We have to find the data she stole." Kyira veered toward the sound, slipping her head around a corner in time to see Ayesha get clipped by a sniper from a nearby roof. Shock rooted Kyira in place as more shots ripped through her, dropping her to the alley. "no," she whispered. Then she shouted it as something snapped inside her. She was running toward the downed figure when a blur passed her on the right. It sped ahead of her and leapt three stories up to the sniper by the time she had gotten to Ayesha. A scream split the night, then another followed by two thumps as a couple of heavy objects landed farther down the alley.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kyira dropped down beside her and carefully cradled her in her arms. Over and over whispering, "No, please, no, not again, please! Don’t die, please..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ayesha’s hand tried to grab Kyira's arm as she forced out, "Data pack... get it to.. it must reach Premiere..." Her hand spasmed as her chest fell and stopped.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tears dripped slowly from Kyira’s eyes as she stared down the alley. She didn’t react when Shandi touched her. Shouts in the distance snapped Shandi’s head up. "We GO!" she said as she pulled at Kyira. She continued to sit, unmoving, until Shandi started to  pick her up, then she slowly rose to stand and allowed herself to be lead away. Once clear of the alley Shandi turned to her and asked, "Which way? Were port?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After several tries her questions penetrated Kyira's fog and she began directing their progress. At the port they encountered more company security guards at the gates.</p>
