<p class="pagecaption">Kyira - Chapter 2</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When they reached the door Ayesha eased herself around Kyira, "I’ll go first. If anything happens to me, go out the back and run for it." She opened the door only enough to slide through and then surveyed the loading area in front of the warehouse. Several dim yard lights painted more shadow than light into the tumbled pallets and empty crates that littered the edges of the yard. Across a rusty gate was closed with a new lock. Slipping from shadow to shadow Ayesha moved to a dark corner of fence and swarmed over. Quickly she prowled the nearby areas. Satisfied she returned and slipped back to the door. "It’s clear, I’ll help you get over the fence. Where do you usually find food?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Closer to the waterfront. Usually I look for some late night scum to grab."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Light from the loading area spilled faintly around the door, allowing Kyira to see Ayesha motion that she would slip out first. A moment later there was a sharp hiss of pain and a thump against the side of the building. The door burst back open and Ayesha staggered in almost falling under the bulk of a large man. Kyira leapt forward and fastened on his neck, drinking as quickly as she could.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He was waiting for us. I almost didn’t get him fast enough." That’s when Kyira saw blood oozing through Ayesha’s tunic. Kyira finished feeding under her horrified and curious gaze. Once she was done she moved to help Ayesha with cleaning and bandaging the wound. Ayesha started to twitch away, then held still as Kyira unbuttoned her tunic and moved it away from the wound. A knife had scored a shallow line down her left arm from shoulder to elbow.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I can mostly control how I feed unless I’m starving. If I’m starving once I start I can’t really stop until I’m sated, or until I can’t get any more. I’m not starving, so you’re safe."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How can you..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I have no choice, if I want to live." Ayesha actually flinched as she said the last.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It’ll have to be ok for now. We need to get going. If there was one here, there will be more."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know of one more safe place, it’s a little harder to get to than this one, since we can’t fly into it." She started through the door, but Ayesha pulled her back and motioned her behind her as they went through the door, only letting her take the lead once she was sure there were no others waiting nearby.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kyira led a twisted path through more narrow alleyways and between buildings until she found a narrow rusted ladder climbing up a wall covered in peeling grey paint. "This used to be an independent warehouse, but it’s been abandoned for several years now." She labored her way up the ladder one handed while Ayesha climbed silently behind her. Once at the top she slipped around a partially open hatchway and into a dusty expanse up under the roof. There was a quiet "oof" behind her as Ayesha squeezed through the opening.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now that we have some time, I would like some answers. I’d like to know who is chasing you and what they want. I want to know why they killed your friend and what they wanted from you last night."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don’t want you to be involved in this..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sweetness, I’m already involved. I was involved the moment I swooped to your aid. You owe me, after hauling me out of the bay, you owe me a lot!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"M’rissa and I were contracted to look into classified company documents, ones dealing with the handling of indigenous races of this world. Four days ago we actually managed to get into the files we needed. We have the downloads and were just waiting for our recovery ship to arrive. It was supposed to be here yesterday or the day before. Until last night there wasn’t even any indication they were on to us. It seems we were wrong." She explained how they had slipped into the company buildings and tapped into the system, then slipped back out.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I heard a bit about something night before last. One of the security programmers was complaining that half the tracking systems had been found disabled a few minutes ago, then when he went to tell his supervisor they found all of them back on. I didn’t hear anything else, only working in production tracking and analysis keeps me pretty far away from security, fortunately."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"My contract out of here is for two, you could come with me...now that they’ve connected us, they’ll never let you alone now. What I really need to figure out is how to check on the ship out of here."</p>
