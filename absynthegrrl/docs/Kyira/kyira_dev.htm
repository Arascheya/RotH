<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on way to port */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Comes in contact with ghost wind when Ayesha goes to hire them transport off planet with the data proving OutSystems was behaving flagrantly outside the law. Ayesha is killed before she can reach the port. Kyira arrives on time and demands waiting for Ayesha. Kara waits until security begins to close in on the ship then leaves.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* need to decide if Kyira ever knows for certain Ayesha was killed */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* could re-work this to tighten up her involvement with Shandi and the ghostwind crew */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* consider changes to this flow - what if Kyira was friends with Ayesha for a while? Say Ayesha had slid into the corporate hq data center as a spy for Valen when OutSystems began aggressive expansion into another area of the Fringe Worlds. They became friends over time and then Kyira rescued her that one night. Shortly after Ayesha is killed, about the same time Shandi arrives on the scene.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* insertable concepts and segments start here: */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* talking to Valen on Ghost Wind */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You worked for the company?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It was either that or prostitution and I never did much like pimps. Though the company isn’t a lot better. I was one of their statistics, local indigent trained and helped by the company to become a functional galactic citizen. I have passport documents and everything, although there is no way they’d actually let me use them. They do look good on the company records though."</p>
