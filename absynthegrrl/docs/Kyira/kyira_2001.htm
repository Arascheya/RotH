<p class="pagecaption">Kyira - Chapter 1</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was late at night near the Western Docks. Bright, warm light spilled from one of the OutSystems Resource Development Company taverns tucked into a small space between two large warehouses. The crowd had shrunk to the few die-hards that would manage to hang on until the night shift took over in a couple of hours. Most nights the party wound down to desultory threats and waving of bottles as the regulars drowned their sorrows before staggering back to the claustrophobic apartments that were company housing. Tonight however, was different. One of the few remaining Vamyr had slid in a few hours ago and taken up residency in one of the far booths. She was one of the few who hadn’t immigrated to distant Milos Hope when the company began an all out campaign to drive them out. Many were killed when they couldn’t find the credits necessary to flee. This alone would have earned her a fair number of stares. What added to the effect was her appearance. She was five feet tall with rich mahogany fur showing where it wasn’t covered by her skimpy halter-top and mid-thigh dress. Her face was lean and fox-like, with large fangs peeping out beneath her lips. The feature that drew the most attention, and marked her for what she was, were the wings folded gracefully behind her back. She was one of the few remaining bats in the city.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At one time or another every eye in the place had surreptitiously stared at her. She had met the ones she noticed with a cold indifference that quickly drove their owners to look anywhere else. About the time she was finishing her glass of red wine a drunken company mid-manager, dressed in the suit of his kind, staggered in. His curt and snobbish manner drew muttered comments and covert glares. No one dared confront him directly though. Few were brave enough to risk the wrath of a company man.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He stared around the room, daring any to challenge him then noticed the bat in the corner. Immediately he made his way to her table and dropped into the seat across from her. "Hi there! What’s a pretty one like you doing in here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Eyes began to turn toward them as the dialog registered on the other patrons. By the time she answered every eye in the place was watching her. Annoyance flicked across her features but he didn’t see it. "Enjoying a quiet drink," was her polite reply while she was thinking, ‘no shit, dipshit...if you were sober you’d be running and screaming now..’ One of the others saw her look turn predatory as she shifted slightly, giving the man a better look down her halter. "Why do you ask, sir?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I was just thinking how good you look in that outfit and how you don’t belong in a dive like this. We could go someplace much nicer..." She smiled coyly at him while her mind was saying, ‘subtle, sooo subtle...’  "Maybe my place? It’ll be quieter..." ‘yes it would, so when I drink you down, no one will hear you...’</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, why not? This place was starting to get on my nerves anyway." Smiling wider she wondered if he even thought about what he’d just done. As she followed him out the door her thoughts turned to the next part of the evening. They would go to his place and she would feed, leaving him near death and maybe a little wiser about accepting an invitation from the next bat he saw. Bitterness twisted in her as her thoughts turned toward her decision, ‘Yes momma, it’s so wonderful being a bat, having to feed on living prey...ever since they killed the last of the blood cattle. At least I can keep this one off the other girls and maybe teach him something in the bargain. Everywhere I go it’s the same story...Greasy little snit, sliming up to me like I was just another trollop to add to his conquests. Some system we have, if I kill him, I get life, or at least prison till I starve, if he kills me he gets his hand slapped, maybe a year or two if he doesn’t have enough friends, where’s the justice here? Maybe I should just finish it...no, maybe he’ll learn...yeah, right...’</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She stroked his ego and listened to his every word as she followed him back to his place. As a company mid-manager he rated better quarters. His place had a small bedroom, separate kitchen, and a real bathtub instead of the cramped shower. He started to set the mood with candles and music but it only made her feel worse. With a barely concealed sigh she threw herself into his arms and began her seduction. Within moments he was ready. He barely felt the bite through the anesthetic of her saliva and the distractions of her hands stroking his body. It wasn’t until he tried to turn his head that he realized she was fastened to his neck. By then he was weak enough that she could drive him back onto the bed and muffle his screams with her hand and wing. A few minutes later it was finished. He lay on the bed barely alive and she was quickly arranging her cloths and cleaning the blood out of her fur. While she waited thoughts chased themselves around her head until she forced them back with her final weapon, ‘tonight mamma, I know you wouldn’t approve, but you’re not here, no one is, and I’m just too tired now. Besides who’ll miss the bat...at work they fear me, to the company I’m just a PR gimmick...’ She slipped from his apartment and made her way to the waterfront. A quick flight brought her to the top of the harbor control tower. ‘In a few minutes then, one last look over the harbor and back into town...Well that didn’t take long...a single leap and then fly out to sea as far as I can before exhaustion forces me into the water. It should be over quick...’</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She swept her wings back and prepared to launch herself from the roof when a scream ripped through the night. Startled, she scrambled for balance as she quickly scanned the docks for the noise. The struggling figures were easily spotted. A knife blade flashed in the faint moonlight as a standing figure bent toward another figure held prone on the dock by two others. "Ok sweet cheeks, where is it? We know you have it. Now give it to us!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With a muttered, "Oh, what the hell..." she scrabbled to a new launch position and leapt toward the figures. The one with the knife was easy. She hit him, driving him back, as her claws ripped his throat to ribbons. The second figure had the warning from the gurgle of his companion and started to turn as she ripped back dropping him also. The third one had enough time to swing something she never really saw as pain exploded through her left wing. She struggled to react and clear her vision at the same time but was too slow. A boot caught her in the chest, throwing her backward off the dock and into the dark water below. For a moment she fought the water as it closed over her, then she relaxed. It was what she had wanted after all. Darkness closed in so quickly that she didn’t even notice when another body splashed into the water near her.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">On the dock the figure that had been down had spun away from the third figure as he kicked the bat. On the way up she grabbed the knife and in a swift motion plunged it into his neck. She took only enough time to drop the long coat she was wearing before she executed a flat dive into the water. She dove again and again until she found the thin motionless figure of the bat. Cold and fatigue were taking their toll as she dragged the still figure onto the beach and began working to revive her. She worked and worked until frustration began to set in. Then she began to swear as she pushed and blew, "Gods damn you, don’t you DARE die. Wake up Kyira, wake up and breath DAMN you, BREATHE!" finally the still figure sucked a breath and choked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Quickly she rolled her sideways as Kyira vomited water and blood. "Shoulda let me die..." The next breath turned into a short, sharp scream as the woman bumped her injured wing. Kyira passed out again. The woman watched until she was certain she was breathing regularly and then carefully lifted the still figure.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Moving carefully and quietly she threaded her way away from the waterfront and into a tangle of narrow streets and alleyways. This was the section between the waterfront and the star port. Here cheap rooming houses fought with warehouses for space. The transient workers lived here, along with company workers too low on the pay scale to afford anything better. Deep within a dark alley a rickety stairway clung desperately to a rotting building. The woman slowly eased her way to its top and swung open the single door. A narrow water stained hallway led deep into the gloom, broken occasionally by doors on each side. The woman stopped at the fifth one down on the right and eased it open, then she crossed to the sagging couch and gently lay Kyira on it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kyira moaned and stirred as the coarse fabric scratched on her back. "Good, you’re awake," the woman said as she snapped on a small light.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kyira’s eyes snapped open. "Ayesha, what the hell are you doing here?" her darting eyes took in her surroundings as she struggled to rise. She subsided with a moan when she tried to move her left shoulder. "Where are we? What’s going on?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Easy, don’t move around so much. You’re wing is broken and you’re at my place. I fished you out of the harbor after you swooped to my rescue. What were you doing in that neighborhood anyway? And what did you mean saying I should have let you die?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I..uh..I..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Without even a thought about your friends you were going to kill yourself, weren’t you? What the fuck were you thinking, that none of us would notice?? Shit." Kyira stared at the floor while Ayesha continued, "Why? Could you at least tell me that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Eyes still focused down Kyira began softly, "Do you have any idea how it feels? I’m a corporate trick for OutSystems. They don’t care what happens, just so long as they can wave me at the cameras when someone talks about their terrible policies toward indigents. Most everyone I work with barely acknowledges my existence, and most of those that do fear me. I have to have blood to live. None of the experiments the bio-tech guys have tried has changed that, although they’ve almost killed me more than once. And now that they’ve killed or driven off the last of the blood cattle, I have to find blood here in the city. I’m tired, Ayesha, so very tired."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I care. Some of the others do too, even if you do scare them. We WOULD miss you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Where are we? What happened? And what’ going on?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We’re in my place. You saved my life. I was being mugged."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And?..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean and? And what?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And...meaning I think there’s more you want to say, Ayesha." Kyira realized it was the wrong thing to say the instant she saw Ayesha’s face close up.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What are YOU doing here? Why were you at the docks? Whose side are you on?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Side? What are you talking about?" Kyira drew a breath to continue, then suddenly stopped. Frantically she motioned at Ayesha, and whispered, "Movement, two, maybe three at the door."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Damn." Ayesha muttered as she snapped the light back off. There was a faint whisper of movement as she slipped to the door. Suddenly it slammed open and a strong light played about the room. It seared across Kyira’s eyes then went wild as she heard a gurgling sound from the doorway. As her vision cleared she saw Ayesha stagger back, grappling with a larger form. Then a third body moved through the doorway toward Ayesha. With an ill-suppressed hiss Kyira launched herself at the third target. Its back swing caught her shoulder and she screamed. As she fell she grabbed with her right hand and clenched. She blacked out as her shoulders hit the floor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She awoke to Ayesha whispering at her, "Come on, wake up. We’ve gotta get out of here!" Her eyes finally focused on Ayesha’s face as she awoke groaning. "Dammit, keep it QUIET!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I seem to do a lot of this passing out..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Come on, we’ve got to get out of here." She hauled the Kyira to her feet and wrapped an arm around her. In her other hand was a bloody knife. "Do you know any place safe? If so tell me how to get there as quickly as we can. But first I want you to wait here until I get to the door, then come down the hall making a bit of noise."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Puzzled, Kyira leaned against the wall and waited. Once Ayesha was in place she started moving. Suddenly the end door burst open and another figure lunged through. An instant later the knife was lodged in its throat and Ayesha was dragging the body back to join the others. "Ok, now we go, but out the back way." She drew Kyira down the corridor, deeper into the building and opened a small door. "Down here, take a left at the bottom and thread your way around the boxes. I’ll be right behind you." Ayesha slid past her once she reached the bottom of the stairs and guided her to a small door. She opened it just wide enough for them to slip through it and into a narrow alley. "Ok Kyira, where to?"</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Kyira started to lead off down an alley then suddenly stopped. "Damn, it doesn’t look the same from the ground... Where are we?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Between the star port and the docks, about five blocks inland from the water."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly Kyira made her way down the alley, gaining confidence as she looked up and recognized several landmarks. "There’re a couple of warehouses nearby that don’t see much traffic, maybe there. I sometimes rest there when I just can’t face ‘home’." Kyira hurried forward down the street and stopped abruptly at a narrow, black opening between two buildings. After a long hesitation she turned into the space and began threading her way over the piles of junk scattered within.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Many twists, turns and crossings later Kyira stopped at the back of a dilapidated building and pointed to the escape ladder clinging to it. "Up there, there’s an upper attic level that never gets used."  She awkwardly leapt upward and hooked the bottom rung with her good arm, hissing sharply as her other arm twisted and banged against the safety cage. Slowly she began to climb, using the cage to help keep her on the ladder. Ayesha scurried up after her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A small door let them into a dusty cramped space just under the roof. Moving carefully Kyira led the way to a cleared patch hidden in the middle of the clutter. There were a couple of ratty blankets and a small table knocked together from empty crates. Carefully she eased herself down to the floor and settled back against a large crate.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A nervous tic had started at the corner of Ayesha’s eye as she said, "Well, I guess you aren’t on their side, unless you’re trying to get in under my defenses."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For long moments Ayesha’s face remained hard and closed, then it suddenly softened and fell. "I guess it doesn’t matter, somehow they found out anyway. Let me tell you a little story. About ten years ago, about the time Valen took power, OutSystems came to the new Resources Directorate and applied for development rights to several newly discovered planets. This was one of them. I was working as an investigator at the directorate then and something about the applications didn’t look right, but when I went looking I couldn’t find anything. I took it to Valen..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You worked for the Butcher?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Don’t call her that!" Ayesha flared. "I can’t stand it when people who don’t even know her call her that." In a quieter voice she continued, "Valen, The Butcher as you call her, kept you alive. You were the corporate trick to keep her off their backs. If she could have gotten even a lousy excuse to investigate OutSystems she would have torn the company apart. I’m here because Valen wanted me to find that excuse. I found it just when the coup happened and I’ve been hiding it ever since. I kept hoping I could figure out who to send it to and if it would do any good. Something happened yesterday, I’m sure you noticed. Suddenly security was everywhere, looking at everything and everywhere. I had though I was safe until I was grabbed on the way home. Now you’ve gotten involved too."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I was wondering. They sent us home early, otherwise I wouldn’t have been where I was. I wonder what they found. Security sure was concerned about something. Valen was deposed months ago. What we need to figure out now is what to do next."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, I need to figure out what next, we have to get you to the MedCenter and then home. I don’t want your life ruined by this."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"My life is already ruined. There’s a company exec that’ll have a very interesting story tomorrow when they find him in his rooms. He made himself a good target and I wasn’t planning on having to worry about it in the morning. I might be able to get through the MedCenter without raising suspicion tonight, but they’ll remember tomorrow when he comes in."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, ok, new plan. I can get you medical treatment and take care of the company man. Did anyone see you with him?" Kyira’s look answered her question. "DAMN. Ok, you need to stay hidden after we get you fixed." She looked at Kyira and commented, "I wouldn’t have expected you to be one to kill yourself."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You just don’t get it do you? I am a child’s worst nightmare given form. At best I can hope for indifference in the people I meet. The company suffers my existence because I’m useful. They’ve denied my every request for emigration to Milos Hope. Nothing substitutes for blood to keep me alive so I have to hunt the streets and take from the ones the company won’t have to notice. Those of you in programming are the closest to friends I have. Although I think quite a few of them would prefer I was anywhere else."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why don’t they just feed you protein or blood bank blood or something? Wouldn’t that work?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"They tried. The protein stuff was awful, it gave me the worst hallucinations I’ve ever had. I’ve tried the blood bank route several times. There’s something that quickly dissipates in blood that isn’t fresh. So far no one has isolated it yet. Sometimes I think the company likes the fact I feed on live prey. As long as I pick the right ones it makes it easier for security to roust them. I think they’d like it better if I killed them. I just can’t bring myself to do that though."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We’d better go before it gets much later. I’ll go first, in case there’s trouble." Ayesha moved across the attic area until she found a narrow ladder descending into the dark.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute. This won’t work. The MedCenter will call my keepers, the bio-guys, to figure out how to fix me, and probably security. By the time everyone is done it’ll be morning and the reports will be coming in."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Next plan then. I try and immobilize your wing until we can get off this planet."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And just how are we going to do that? They’ll be watching every ship..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Damn it all. Will you give me a chance here? I was trained to do this. It may take some time but I will get us out of here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And you’ll disguise me as what? A trophy? A bag of something?" Sarcasm dripped from Kyira’s words.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Are you always this caustic or is it for my benefit?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh this is just for you." Kyira replied pasting on a bright fake smile. "I’d love to get out of here, but what am I going to do on any length of ship voyage? I can go a couple of days before I get hungry. I can go maybe four days before I’m ravenous. After that...well if there is food nearby I’ll not be able to stop myself. So, what is your bright idea for handling that? Or would you like to volunteer as part of the meal service?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ayesha shuddered before asking, "So how were you going to emigrate then?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It’s only a couple of days to Milos Hope. If I fed just before leaving and everything went well I’d be ok until arrival. Problem is there’s nothing else in range. I looked."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Did anyone see you leave the company man’s place?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, I used the window and balcony. I’m not sure anyone saw me go in either, although there might have been a security system. I really didn’t look."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Then we have a chance. If we could make him disappear in some way that didn’t point at you this could still work."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So, you’ll just fly up to his balcony, enter, and carry him away?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, I won’t fly, but yes, I’ll spirit him away." Ayesha was pacing again. "Did you know him? What would happen if you were found there injured - we could make it look like you were trying to help him."</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">/* this section is really screwy - i don't like it - why does she fracture? how does Ayesha push her into it? what do they do with the body in the room? */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, I won’t fly, but yes, I’ll spirit him away." Ayesha was pacing again. "Did you know him? What would happen if you were found there injured - we could make it look like you were trying to help him. I could attack him, kill him, and dump him. Everyone seems to be looking for me anyway."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No. I won’t let you do that for me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Look..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No. I don’t want that blood on your hands and his death on my conscience. There has to be another way."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"If we could find out where he worked, maybe we could blame the security breach on him. Do you have any idea what happened today?"</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Ayesha started pacing again while muttering under her breath. "Is there any place we can hide until we can get a ship to Milos Hope?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* want to keep this sectrion - must make the crash and burn believable - could be here or could be on Ghost Wind after the death of Ayesha - although Ayesha knows her well enough to comment on her not asking for help */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There isn’t anyone for you is there..." Her voice was soft and warm and full of things Kyira couldn’t even recognize.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ayesha’s comment rippled through Kyira. Scars she had thought long sealed over tore open to spin her thoughts back to a warm summer afternoon many years past. Trying desperately to shove the memories away she hissed, "I don’t need anyone!" Her sightless eyes betrayed her as tears ran down her face. Ayesha took her in her arms so gently her wing didn’t even throb. Kyira, not wanting comfort or contact, tried to stiffen up, to shove Ayesha away, but her body wouldn’t respond. Then she tried to scream at her, but her voice wouldn’t work. Lost in the memories she began to speak, so quiet and empty sounding that Ayesha was sure she didn’t even realize she had. "My mom was the last one. We had gone into hiding in a narrow back street when day came, trying once again to stay out of sight of the security forces. There was a small boy playing in the alley with a ball. I had awoken early and I had just wanted to talk to him. Momma was still sleeping from a long night of hunting. Just as I was about to say something to him he saw me and began to scream. Shouts echoed and soon the sound of running feet reached me. Just before security rounded the corner Momma appeared. She shoved me back into an abandoned building then waited for the police to spot her. Immediately she took off running. They yelled for her to stop, but she kept going. The first blasts staggered her, but she kept running. The second volley brought her to her knees, but she crawled on. The third volley stopped her, all but her hand, which still tried to drag her along, until finally it lay still also. They approached her slowly, watching for even a twitch. Their leader kicked her over and slammed his boot into her side to see if she’d jerk. When they were satisfied they left. They just left her where she lay. No one lifted a finger to move her as the crowd that had formed drifted away. When the street was empty I ran to her. Sightless eyes stared up at me..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She hadn’t realized she was talking until she heard Ayesha say something. She was still so wrapped into the memory that all she heard was a voice where there shouldn’t have been one. The feeling of arms penetrated vaguely, as if from a great distance. "I killed her. Just as sure as if I’d shot her myself."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ayesha moved her then and crudely set her wing but Kyira remained far away until early in the morning when hunger pulled her awake. As she regained her senses she felt warmth next to her. Ayesha had curled up against her and sometime while she had slept had thrown a protective arm around her. The blood in her arm sang to Kyira, calling to her with the siren song of life. Ayesha woke when Kyira moved. Kyira stared for long moments before she asked, "Why are you doing this? I don’t understand. And if you say because I saved your life once more I’ll strangle you!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Believe what you need to, but some of us really do care. Someone cared enough to talk OutSystems into taking care of you instead of having another vagrant bat disappear. You cared enough to rescue me. I cared enough to rescue you and now I want to get both of us away from here. Do you have any ideas?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kyira started to sit up until the spinning in her head forced her to lay back down abruptly. "Oh shit, I need food. I forget how fast I use it when I’m hurt."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Apprehension flashed across Ayesha's face, then it was replaced with concern, "Vomiting it out on the shore probably doesn’t help either."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It’s ok, maybe I can find a drunk to siphon off. I’ll be back in a while."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’ll come with you..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No. It’s too dangerous."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It’ll be more dangerous if you go alone."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once again the summer afternoon flashed in Kyira’s mind. Panic surged up and she scrambled back screaming, "NO!!" as her lips curled into a snarl and she brought her clawed hands up to strike. Pain exploded through her head as she fought herself, trying to stop the anger, terror, and hurt chasing through her thoughts. After long moments of remaining locked rigid so she wouldn’t strike at Ayesha she crumpled to the floor. The sound of movement snapped her head up again. "NO, stay away from me, don’t touch me!" Panicked, she screamed and scrambled back toward the wall, only to scream again when her broken wing hit the wall. Ayesha rushed closer, her concern a crushing wave sweeping over the huddled bat. By the time Ayesha reached her, Kyira was screaming incoherently and shaking like a leaf in a summer storm. Kyira shook harder as Ayesha moved closer, seeking to hold her. Finally Kyira found enough control to manage a few words in a row, "Don’t, please... just move away from me." Ayesha didn’t respond at first then slowly she backed away until Kyira’s shaking slowed. Breathing deeply Kyira fought to stop the shakes as Ayesha looked on, tears streaming silently down her cheeks.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her tears snapped something inside Kyira then. Suddenly she was shouting, so mad the words almost wouldn’t form fast enough to make sense. "What is it with you? Stop caring about me. Just go away and let me die. I don’t want your help. I don’t need you help. Just GO AWAY!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tears of compassion turned to tears of pain as Ayesha lost it in the face of Kyira’s anger, "You can’t let anyone close to you can you? Why can’t you let me help? What’re you going to do when it gets to be too much? Will you ever even try to ask for help?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her words stopped the tirade as Kyira responded in a matter of fact voice, "It’s been too much for a long time now. What do you think I was trying to do last night?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What a waste. I won’t stay and watch your destruction. I can’t. Once I thought we were friends." Ayesha turned and headed toward the ladder down. With one last look she started to open the small door and step out.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Help," Kyira almost whispered. "Help," a little louder this time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ayesha stopped halfway through the door, "Did you say something?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Please... help... me..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She set her things back down and moved back to Kyira, "What can I do?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Please tell me why you care. I don’t understand."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I like you. And I know you care. If you didn’t it wouldn’t bother you to prey off the rest of us."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tears poured down Kyira’s face as she curled into a tight little ball. This time she welcomed the arms that enfolded her while she cried tears that came from deep inside. Tears for her mother, for the things she’d never had, for the victims she’s hurt, and the few she’d accidentally killed while learning how much she could take. Finally the tears slowed, then stopped. She dried them on Ayesha’s tunic and said, "I really need to find food."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Is that all?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That’s all I can ask now." Things were sliding back into place in her mind. She was walling up again, trying to deny to herself that she’d let Ayesha see that much of her. Ayesha just watched her until she stood, then asked what she needed. Kyira explained, watching as the blood drained from Ayesha's face. "It’s not that bad. I never target people I like. Usually I target the slime that preys on others, figuring if they’re predators, maybe they should see how it feels to be prey. Just help me find a pimp somewhere and I’ll be fine." Kyira led the way to a narrow set of stairs descending into the warehouse itself. Moving by hearing and memory more than sight she slowly picked out the path to the front of the building and a small door set into the wall.</p>
