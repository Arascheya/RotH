<p class="regtxt5">Hey how is my favorite Aunt doing?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Well the 4 gates we went after are closed; most of us came out of it alive if not well.  Most of us are going into hiding for we all figure that The Hand will be sending assassins after us.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An Arcane I know spelled two scroll tubes for me, when you put a message for me into the one you get with this message, then put a point of renewable POW into it while pressing the rubies on the end caps it will TP the message into my scroll tube.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">No intercepted messages as only you can open the tube being sent to you and only I can open the tube I have.  Yeah maybe I am a bit paranoid but better safe than sorry.  I will be drifting around the world avoiding my old haunts and yes I don’t look anything like myself anymore.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">How are things going at the tavern?  Did Acanthus make it back to Shetra?  Oh I also put a bug in my Arcane friend’s ear to look into a limited teleport that would be point-to-point specific depending on what type of gem is used to feed the thing.  Figure renewable POW and a set sized gem to power the TP.  Set them up in safe areas in each of the major cities and regions, good for quick jumps for information gathering.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I think you know the Arcane his name is Hann lives in the Gardens of Lazaar.   Great guy at making magical things he and I had a lot of conversations.  He said his major problem is that he runs out of ideas after a while and then needs to go and visit people and places to get more ideas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Take care and hope all is well with you.  Let me know any news on the
aftermath of our project.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Your loving nephew</p>
