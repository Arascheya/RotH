<p class="regtxt5">/* after she steps through the Sphynx Web */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I awoke face down in sweet smelling grass with warm sun beating down on me. I rolled over to see where I was only to freeze in shock. The sky above wasn’t the pale blue of my homeland, rather it was a pale violet. Once more I had no idea of where I was. Another look at the sky told me it was just after dawn, or just before sundown. A longer look around revealed I was in a small clearing on a hillside overlooking a large village.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Not knowing what else to do I sheathed my cutlass and began to move toward the village. Stealthy movements on my left raised the hair on my neck and encouraged me to pull my greatsword. I stopped and waited, intending to draw whatever it was into showing itself. Three large man-like creatures emerged from the forest. They were dressing in black armor and carried battle axes. One of them pointed and said something in a language I didn’t understand. Then it pointed toward the ground and motioned for me to drop my weapon. Instead I gripped it tighter, backed against a tree, and waited.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The biggest one rushed at me, yelling and waving its axe with great relish. I parried quickly and deftly slashed back, leaving a track across its belly. It fell back howling in agony as the magical acid from my blade ate deep into its flesh. My fear eased a bit when I saw it bleeding red blood. It closed again with renewed fury while its friends circled for advantage. Years of training and hard work paid off when I was able to drop my first foe with a quick thrust to the throat. The rest of my fear vanished when it died normally. The remaining two came at me again and the forest rang with the clash of steel on steel. As the battle wore on each of us began to tire. One of them stepped back and pulled a horn to its lips. A quick swing shattered the horn along with its skull. The third one stepped back and fled with the death of its companion. A swift motion brought my mythryl dagger up and I let fly, catching it in the back of a leg. As I leaned over to give it the warrior’s cut I saw its eyes widen in shock as it noticed my dagger. It mumbled something as I finished it. Once again I silently thanked Rapscallion for the dagger. It was a present from him after our first adventure together.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After camouflaging the bodies I headed out for the village again. The sun was high in the sky when I came to the edge of the road running from the hills in the distance to the nearest gate. It only took a moment to decide to approach openly along the road. As I drew closer to the gate a couple of nervous looking men and two well outfitted centaurs watched my approach. When I was within hailing distance one of them shouted something at me. I slowly shrugged and kept walking, keeping my hands well away from my weapons. As I drew closer I could see through the gates into a town square beyond. A heated conversation seemed to be taking place between a group of centaurs and a group of townspeople.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The centaurs at the gate motioned for me to stop, then called to the group inside. The largest, a handsome blonde male, turned and trotted up to us. As he neared he studied me as carefully as I studied him. He was large, well muscled, with clean lines. He moved with the easy grace of a well trained fighter. His long blonde hair was swept back from a strong handsome face. A long braodsword hilt peeked over his back and a short bow was tied near it. Chain mail over heavy leather protected most of him. He began to speak as he neared us. Once again I shrugged at the strange sounds. He peered at me intently for long moments, then began to try different languages until he finally hit on something that sounded like the lowest form of gutter jargon spoken in Tasmin. What he managed to say sounded something like, "Peace warrior wench. I Danbar Rambonichka, service you. From hail where you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I formed the most polite reply I could manage in guttereese and replied, "Greetings good sir. I am Jan Swordbreaker, at your service. I have fallen in some nasty excrement from a high powered magic user and have been dropped here. I was headed to the city of Tasmin, do you know of it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Arcanes eh? They’re always shitting on someone, godless heathens that they are. Is Tasmin in the Realms of the Dark?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The intensity of hatred he placed on the term Arcane puzzled me. It was as if he had said plague. "I know nothing of the ‘Realms of the Dark’. What are they? Why do you hate Arcanes so?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Arcanes are godless beings that roam the world seeking money and power. They ignore the paths of the true gods. Ah, but I am remiss in my duties, may I lead you to your temple that you may refresh yourself.? There we can talk of this.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why would I want to go to a temple? Surely I can rest at a good inn."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Surely you want to check in with your cult leaders, to pay your tithes and let them know you are here." Suspicion began to color his voice as he continued, "unless you are one of those godless Arcanes. If you are take your cursed self to the guild in Belkoran, we don’t want your type here!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Quickly I began to try and ease his fears, but before I had gotten very far a building across from us erupted into flames. As I turned back to see Danbar’s reaction several black arrows sprouted from his chest and neck. I whirled, grabbing my throwing dagger, and let fly. It caught an archer in the throat. Then I spun and pulled the arrows out of Danbar and dumped one of my last two healing potions down his throat. Just as I finished it struck me that I had no idea if it would poison him, cure him, or do nothing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Long moments dragged by before the magic began to close his wounds. Slowly color returned to his flesh and he began to moan. I stood and prepared to protect Danbar as the healing progressed. As I pulled my greatsword something thunked my left shoulder, I ignored the blow, intent on killing the nearest foe. Even as I looked for a foe a centaur to my left screamed and died in a blst of lightening. I lunged for the magic user, narrowly avoiding a blow meant for my skull. He was too busy concentrating on his next spell to avoid my lunge and died, impaled on my blade.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once more I whirled, looking to strike another target. One caught my eye as he prepared to throw a star at one of Danbar’s aids. He died with his spine severed. The ‘star he had been holding turned into a small mauve spider when it hit the street. It died under the frantic hooves of a pale, sweating grey centaur. Later I found out the bite of the spider was death, and that only ‘Priests’ and Lords’ of the Ishra cult could produce the nasty spider throwing stars.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As quickly as the battle had started, it ended, with all the attackers dead in the streets. It turned out that the only member of Dan’s group to die was the poor centaur hit by lightening. Later we heard that several buildings had burned to the ground, thirty townspeople had died, and fifty had been injured. The enemy had lost ten men.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dan groggily shook his head and looked around. "Alright which one of you just tried to poison me? Razaks below, that was the most vile healing draught I’ve ever experienced.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I would be the poisoner," I replied.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dan looked down and laid a gentle hand on my arm, "Thank you lady Jan for saving my life. I am in your debt. Let me begin to repay you by healing your shoulder." Only as I felt his gentle touch on my shoulder did I remember the blow that had caught it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I did not know clerics could wear armor, wield weapons, and heal! What wonderful beings are your gods!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I fear you have it wrong, Lady Jan. I merely used a simple healing spell on you. If you had required anything more impressive you would have had to go to the Cassi temple and consult the healers there. Surely you know that simple healing spells are available to anyone with cult affiliations." He turned to his group, "It would appear that the Dark Forces are closer than we thought. We need to convince these stubborn villagers to fall back to Daraven as soon as possible. Now, which temple is yours, Lady Jan."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ishtar, goddess of war." I replied.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Where have you come from?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Completely baffled, I briefly explained my arrival to him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ancients above, you are an Import! The Ancients themselves must have sent you to help us combat the Forces of the Dark. I am honored to have been able to fight, such as it was, at your side! I fear you will not find a temple to Ishtar anywhere near here. There are, however, several other Imports living at an inn called the White Elephant, in Daraven. I would be honored if you would accompany me there and allow me to extend to you the courtesies of a room and a meal."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Not wanting to offend the centaur, and knowing nothing about the current situation, I graciously accepted his offer. He lead me into the town and over to a worn building that sported a faded sign showing a curving road leading to a building with lighted windows and smoke curling from its chimney. "Welcome to the Road’s End Hostel. I shall inform the innkeeper that you are to be afforded every courtesy. I would suggest that you please not wander around until I have had a chance to acquaint you with the speech of the region. It would be most distressing if you were injured through a foolish misunderstanding. Meanwhile I must return to convincing these villagers of the folly of remaining in the path of the invasion forces. I shall just inform the innkeeper of your presence and then leave you until later, my lady." He bent low to kiss my hand. I felt my heart spasm as I realized how he reminded me of Rapscallion.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I turned abruptly and strode into the inn, hearing as I did so him call to the innkeeper. I found a quiet corner, farthest from the door, and settled into it. A few minutes later the innkeeper came over, asked my pleasure, and gave me directions to my room.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He returned shortly with a large tankard of the finest mead I have ever tasted. It was rich scented, full bodied, and possessed of a deep, mellow flavor. I had just leaned back to relax and savor it when a group of rowdy mercenaries strode in. seeing me, they sauntered over and sat down near my table. They were laughing and joking amongst themselves when one of them motioned my way and whispered something to his neighbor. The neighbor, an older man, perhaps the leader, looked my way and shook his head. The younger one said something rude sounding, stood, and approached my table. He tried several languages when he found I did not understand him. Then he launched into the old standard line, "aren’t you lonely over here by yourself? Why not come over and join us?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I could tell by the way he was watching me that it wouldn’t be long before it would be an invitation to his room. I felt the cold sweat begin to run down my back as my guts began to knot, just like every other time. "Thank you for your kind invitation but I have traveled far, fought hard, and am very tired. Perhaps some other time." I replied and took my leave.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In the privacy of my room I slipped out of my chain mail intending to lie down a while. As I slipped the leather hauberk over my head I caught a glimpse of myself in the cracked mirror hanging from the back of the scarred door. I turned slightly and looked closer, to see how my shoulder had healed. All that remained of the wound was a faint whitish puckered scar. As I turned back a thin, hazel eyed, chestnut haired young woman stared back at me. She was average height and rather plain. Her face was made up of too many angles to be pretty. As I thought about it, the plainness had been a blessing, since few men found me attractive.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I slipped the rest of the way out of my armor, set my sword on the wall side of the bed, my best dagger under the pillow, then sank down on the bed to let my tortured guts relax. I hadn’t meant to fall asleep, but enough had happened that my body decided it needed it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I awoke to stealthy movements outside my door. Quickly I grabbed my dagger and slipped silently to the door. I arrived as the door began to swing slowly inward. As the figure cleared the opening I shoved one dagger against his lower back and wrapped my other arm around his throat. "If there is anyone else out there, back off or this one dies." I heard two sets of rapid footsteps moving off down the hallway. I kept the dagger in the back of my captive and quick marched him to the common room, arriving just after the other two sets of footsteps. I saw two of the mercenaries that had been near my corner. The one I thought was the leader was still seated at the table. He was the only one of the bunch with the grace to look embarrassed. The others began laughing and carrying on. I admit I must have looked a sight standing there in the thin linen garb I usually wore under my armor.
"Innkeeper, I appreciate your policy of having the servants check on the comforts of your guests, but I tend to be very grouchy when disturbed. Please inform your staff that I prefer to remain undisturbed." I said as I pushed my captive into the common room.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At the word servant several of the mercenaries began to scowl and reach for weapons, but their leader just sat back and laughed. "What happened Stelson, the kitten have claws for a change?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Most of the men smiled in spite of themselves. Stelson grumbled and stomped out. The rest of the night passed uneventfully. In the morning I awoke in the same place as when I went to sleep. Intending to grab a quick bite and then look for Dan, I entered the common room. Once I was seated the innkeeper bustled up and began laying out a feast on my table. At my puzzled look he said, "My lady, the mercenary captain asked that you be provided with the best this morning. I am to tell you that he thought the ‘Vengeful Vision’ deserved the very best, and to pass on his sincerest appologies for his men. Dan also left word that he will meet you here shortly."<p class="sectioncaption">Kyira</p>
<p class="regtxt5">a bat's tale. This is the beginnings of the back story for one of the River Wind crew.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="Kyira/kyira_2001.htm">Kyira -section 1</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="Kyira/kyira_2002.htm">Kyira -section 2</a> - this is a work in progress, there are several sections that are reworkings of the same basic concepts, only one will be in the final assembly...:)</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="Kyira/kyira_dev.htm">Kyira -Development Notes</a></p>
Dan’s timing was perfect. Just as I was finishing the last of my feast he arrived. He was almost at my table when the ground began to tremble, then shake. Dust fell from the ceiling and crashes came from the kitchen. When the mortar began falling from the fireplace we all headed for the street. Elsewhere things were even worse as poorly constructed buildings began to collapse. The shaking continued to increase as the center of the village began to slowly push upwards. Buildings tumbled, wagons rolled down the steapening hill with dislodged rocks and trees following after. Tripping and sliding we joined the throng scrambling for the gate.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* broo attack in the night Jan fights through entire battle, at end back to back with Dan */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Once again my lady I am honored to have fought with you. Few are the warriors that could have lasted through that nightmare fight. I should be honored if you would join me for brief refreshment before you dive back into sleep."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I shall be grateful for that drink, after I retrieve my dagger. It has served me well and has great sentimental value."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He had just pulled out a flask of excellent brandy when I returned. As he handed me a small cup of it he asked, "Lady Jan, might I ask a rather personal question? Why are you carrying a sacred metal dagger? Do you not know that sacred metals interfere with the use of magic?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I am not a magic user or cleric, therefore I need not worry about carrying or wearing metal."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I do not understand. Here anyone can learn simple magics. Things for repairing equipment, healing minor wounds, improving their weapons in battle. These magics are only blocked by the sacred metals, mere steel and iron have no effect on it. Then there are the higher power cult holy spells, available only to initiates, lords, and priests. These spells are far more powerful and only available with the sacrifice of one’s personal magical energies. This energy is part of every living thing and thus anyone can gain access to these spells also. Last of all is the Arcane magic, a system requiring long, difficult study and much money. This last type is only available to Arcanes and is greatly feared for its power. There are now godly restraints on this magic. It forms the stuff of legends and ancient horrors. Only lawless, greedy and power mad people follow that path.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* first time at White Elephant */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This was my first visit to the famed White Elephant, the inn which became my home for a time. Even from the outside it was an impressive structure, made of white washed, finely dressed stone and extending upwards two stories. The entry door was made of stout oak, banded with iron and guarded by two of the ugliest human half breeds I have ever seen. A small sign near the door said only Imports, Lords, Priests, and certified adventurers were permitted to enter. The guards firmly barred my way until Dan stepped forward and said, "I think it wise you should immediately reconsider. With me I have the Lady Jan Swordbreaker, fearless warrior and Import, sent here by the Ancients themselves to fight against the Hand and the Realms of the Dark."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was embarrassed, the guards were unimpressed but one of them did enter the building and returned a few minutes later to usher me inside. Dan gave me a quick grin and told me I could find him at the centaur section. My guide led me down a long, obviously trapped, hall to a slender, fancifully dressed man.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Greetings dear lady. I am Cyrano, at your service. Please allow me to escort you to the bar and get you the drink of your choice. Then we may regale each other with the tales of our exploits. I, myself, am known for several small incidents, but I am sure they would be trivial when compared to your adventures." He threw an arm around my shoulder and guided me to the large teak bar dominating the common room. As quickly as I could I shrugged his arm off my shoulders, forcing myself to relax at the same time.</p>
