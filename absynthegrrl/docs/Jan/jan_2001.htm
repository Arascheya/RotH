<p class="pagecaption">Jan Swordbreaker - Chapter 1</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I sat and pondered once more the events leading up to my current situation, hoping to come up with some kind of answer. A village had turned to mummified remains and we had found the reasons, remedied them, and were on our way back. We were planning to rest and spend our earnings when we were set upon by brigands and thieves. We defeated them but not before Rapscallion had been killed. Ah, Rapscallion, you vain centaur, we cleaned you up as best we could before leaving you to rest on the rock outcropping. I will remember you always, my best of companions. But enough of this, you are dead and with the gods, while the gods alone know where I am.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We had bedded down as always, around the fire with Kachilla and Jarl on first watch. When I awoke the sun was streaming in my eyes from almost directly overhead. It was a bright whitish sunlight, harsh and direct. Someone had forgotten to awaken me for last watch. I sat up to take them to task and found myself alone in an enormous columned hall. I called, then shouted but no one answered except mocking echoes of my own voice, thrown back to me by the cavernous place. High overhead was the window admitting the sunlight which drove the blackness back into the rows of columns, leaving a bright square in  which I stood. Fine trackless dust covered the floor and no breeze stirred the still dry air.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It seemed as if an angry magic user had cursed me to this forgotten realm, but what of the others? Where were they?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I pulled myself back from those thoughts and rummaged in my pack for one of my few remaining torches. I lit it, shouldered my pack and set off to find a way out of where I was. As I passed between columns I began to notice the hall was much longer than it was wide. Within a short time I was at one of the walls. It stretched far off to the right but only a short way to the left. Three pools of inky blackness clung to its surface, indicating portals or openings leading deeper within. I slowly moved to the closest one and bent to examine the dust. Several sets of footprints immediately drew my attention. Pulling my cutlass and thrusting my torch forward I stepped into the revealed hallway. Heavy stone walls closed in around me, pressing down with the weight of age and size. Momentary panic surged from the old fears of dark and closed places. Ruthlessly I pushed them back down, as I had done so many times before. Still the fear scrabbled at the edges of my thoughts, seeking a weakening, or a distracted moment to pounce once more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The footsteps drew me around a corner and into a long hall where the sunlight failed to reach. The footsteps lead straight down the hallway to a small opening that spilled a faint yellow light into the gloom. Cautiously I eased myself up to the portal and glanced around it. It opened into a small room with two carved sphinxes facing each other. Between them was a glowing spider web of pure yellow light. The footsteps walked up to it and disappeared. Slowly I approached and looked all around. Behind the web there was only dust. At the web they just ended. One was even cut right in half. Having heard of disintegration spells and other nasty things I turned from the web and made my way back to the corridor. I turned away from the way I had come and began to walk deeper into the building.</p>
