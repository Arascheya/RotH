<p class="regtxt5">Irena sat on a stool by the bed, staring down at the child. Doc Cochran had left her to watch the girl until he returned from the Gem Saloon. Her thoughts turned to why she had arrived here, cirious about what sort of nexus this could be, when a sharp pounding came from the door. A second later it was pushed open and a man walked in. It took a moment, but her memory called up the face and the name Al Swearengen. "Yes?" sheasked as he strode into the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The doc asked me to look in on the girl."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh? You've seen she's attended to. Thank you for your concern."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need to look more closely."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No," Irena responded as she slipped to her feet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Impede me and you will die slowly on the point of my fucking knife."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena smiled, stalked toward him, and purred, "Really? That might be fun." For a moment uncertainty flickered in his eyes, then he reached to draw his knife. Irena spun around him, grabbed his hand, and hauled it up behind him. I see you are used to compliant women. How about a counter offer? You leave and I don't break your neck." She took him in as she held him. A subtle scent, bathed recently enough that his odors weren't too strong, corded muscle, shifting carefully, exploring her grip, only a small hint of fat, attractive in a blustery, bearish kind of way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Agreed," he said, relaxing his muscles and waiting.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please don't send a kill squad later. I don't want their blood on my hands," Irena added as she released him and backed a way to a respectful distance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Swearengen surveyed the woman before turning to the door. She was dressed in good but ordinary clothes, not the rich items of the Garrett woman, nor the cheap and guady clothes of a whore. She was tall, almost as tall as Trixie, but with a self-possession uncommon in the camp. Her face was plain, her hair long, dark, and pulled back. Her skin was darker, possibly of mixed race, and she was warm. He remembered the heat of her as she had held him close. "You wouldn't be a Pinkerton?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her sneer convinced him more than her words, "Those scum? I certainly am not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A good afternoon to you, ma'am. Come by the Gem if you have need of a drink."</p>
