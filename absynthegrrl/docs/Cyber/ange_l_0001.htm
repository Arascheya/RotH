<p class="regtxt5">You would think that a store selling books wouldn't survive in a world where everything could be gotten through networked systems, and you'd be right for basic entertainment. Lestrade and Petrie Booksellers, my family's store, had given over half of the public sales area to rentable download stations and network points. We did a deslutory business with this. We made our money on people who wanted information, but didn't want any electronic tags, trackers, or other snooping applied to what they were looking at. It had gotten so bad we had day to week long waiting lists for access to some of our archives.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I am Angelique Mereret Lestrade and I am named for my great great great aunt. Lestrade and Petrie Booksellers has been in my family since it was started by Inspector Lestrade, his wife, and his best friend, John Petrie, in the late 1890s. It's been expanded many times and has mostly thrived through the years. It started as a place to sell new and used penny dreadfulls and news. The inspector had a fondness for rare books and the more arcane and alternative the better. After he retired from Scotland Yard, he made it the rest of his life's work to aquire as many as he could. We have scrolls from the library at Alexandria, verified by a reliable source, ancient texts from around the globe, and a copy of every Scotland Yard incident report ever written, the unaltered, original texts, that is.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I looked up from the old, two-dimensional video game on the counter terminal, when the door chime sounded. Another street rat had wondered in. She was medium height, scruffy, and had the usual bag over her shoulder. She looked around before slowly approaching the counter. As she came closer, I was struck by how familiar she seemed. "Hi," she started, then stopped. On close inspection her clothes were a costume. The dirt was real, but applied in more regular patterns than normal accumulation would cause. Her hair was ragged, but was in good health. Her skin wasn't as rough or undernourished as a regular street rat. This girl was slumming and that made her dangerous. The corps would sometimes send people in to try and recover our data.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How can I help you?" I asked. I pressed the second alarm under the counter, the one that told others to carefully monitor the new arrival, and left my fingers resting against it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, can I look at the special collections lists, the non-networked ones?" Her voice increased the sense that I should know her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you aware of the rates?" She nodded and passed over the access fee. The button under my fingers pulsed in the pattern for safe. "One moment, I need to get someone to watch the front." I pushed a different button under the counter and waited for my mother to come out of the back. "Archives," I said, nodding at the street rat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She followed me behind the counter and to the wooden door that closed off the rest of the building from the front. I waved my hand over a detector while making it look like I was reaching for the knob. The door swung open on silent hinges to the dark paneled hall behind it. "The collections lists are in the shelf to your let. They are quite extensive, is there something I can help you find?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's awfully obscure, but I'm looking for information on the Marsters family. Specifically, Angelique Marsters, the one who lived in the late 1800's."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you have anything that could help narrow down the search? We have quite a bit of material from the 1800's."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm looking for information on the murder of Angelique's family in 1887 and after."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That helps," I replied as I led the way down the hall to an intersection, turned left, and descended several flights of stairs into an older section of the archives. Behind a heavy oak door was a room furnished to look like a gentleman's study in the late 1800s. "This is the Inspector Lestrade's study, from when he first started collecting and curating this archive." I sat in the chair behind the desk and pulled a heavy bound volume from the lowest drawer. "This is the listing of documents from London, during the time Inspector Lestade was active."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The girl took it reverently and laid it gently on the other side of the desk. She pulled the other chair up and sat across from me as she pulled a worn, brown leather bound book from her bag. It opened to a well read section and she consulted it for several minutes, then opened the listing. "Maybe you could help? I am looking for references to the opening of Imhotep exhibit at the London Museum in 1895."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything in specific about it or general information?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was there a gala dinner for patrons and contributors? Who would have been on the guest list? Did anything out of the ordinary happen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is your intent with anything you find?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you ask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The information you want would be considered Eyes Only and Top Level Clearance if it were held by a corp. I have an obligation to make sure it is not spread beyond this repository."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stared at me for a very long time, "Personal curiosity, mostly. This journal came to me recently and it raised questions because some of the entries seemed odd."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, you have no plans to release this data to anyone other than yourself? Would you be willing to sign a non-disclosure to that fact?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I agree," she replied slowly, "but I don't understand what could require things that long ago to be secret." I slid a paper form in front of her. It was an iron clad non-disclosure agreement, checked and re-checked by some very powerful lawyers, and worded to be easily understood. Her eyebrows rose as she read through it, before slowly printing and signing her name, Elaine Ariana Timemenson.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you need a copy of this, for your lawyers, Elaine?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ariana or Ari, please. You aren't going to ask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If your stage name is Rianna Scarlett? No. I thought you were slumming, but we consider a client's privacy paramount here. Since we are trading names, I am Angelique Mereret Lestrade, named for the Inspector's good friend Angelique Marsters."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can you tell me what is so sensitive about this data?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll let you read the data first. If it isn't clear after, then I will answer." I turned and pulled a well thumbed book from the shelf behind me. It was one of my personal favorites, a journal written by the inspector. I opened it to a specific page and said, "Start here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She looked back up at me, then down at the page. I could almost recite the section from memory.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Tonight was spent with Mere at the British Museum opening of the Imhotep exhibit. The Wellinghams sent a carriage for me. Mere was already inside. Mere seemed excited and nervous at the same time. When I asked about it, she shrugged it off, although there were tears in her eyes. She brushed off my second attempt with a "I'll tell you later. We'll be late if I start now."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dinner was the expensive, very rich food that the wealthy seemed to appreciate. It was a bit much for my simpler life. Mere picked at her food, but she always did that. Lucy and Mina were as animated as usual. The Wellingham's guests were there as well. I had been introduced before, but they still struck me as odd. In my work I see lots of people pretending to be things they are not, so I can see through facades rather easily. What I saw underneath the guests was almost impossible to understand. One was introduced as Irena Valinsky. She had an unconcious regalness that effected everyone around her. Karen Kyrstal was a soldier. She had a watchful awareness I have only seen in career military. The third woman, Sandra Madsen was just plain scary. There was a coiled spring violence about her that never relaxed. She came across as if she should be in an asylum until you talked to her. Then she spoke in a curious, clipped, deliberate manner, but she was scarily smart, just like the others.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dinner passed quickly, without any notable events.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Mere and I followed the Wellinghams and their guests into the actual exhibit when dinner was finished. The three imposters stopped in front of a diorama of a workroom. A wax figure of Imhotep sat on a stool with fake papyrus plans on a work table. A scribe sat cross-legged on the floor, making notes on clay tablets. In front of the display were several papyrus scrolls and clay tablets that had been found in the dig. Irena stopped in front of one and whispered to Karen, "I have seen that script before, and recently too."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Where?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"While visiting She Who Must Never be Named," Irena replied. Karen looked thoughtful at that news and I felt a chill at the way Irena had spoken the name. Irena must have seen me react because she started moving her fingers in a weird way. The other two followed, almost as if they were having a private conversation.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I turned to Mere, to ask about it. She grabbed my hand before I could say anything and hurried me past the others, to the exit. "I have to get out of here," she hissed in my ear.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I hurried her out of the museum and to the carriage that had brought us. When I asked her waht was wrong she shook her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. "Take me, take me to the Petrie's, please."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">It was a long trip, in silence, to Dr. Petrie's in Limehouse. Once we were inside she asked we be left alone for a bit. Once Petrie nd his wife were out of the room, sobs burst from her. I had seen Mere in many moods, but I had never seen her cry like this.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"He was my father. He took care of me, loved me, even when I became the monster. I miss him so much. I thought I could handle it, but seeing our workroom, it brought it all back." She sniffled, the gave a strangled laugh, "And they got it wrong. It was never a man at my father's knee, it was always me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The girl looked up from the journal, "Who is Mere?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mere is the inspector's private name for Angelique Marsters."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How could she be the daughter of Imhotep?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's the restricted part of the data. You should read from this section," I said as I flipped back several pages, "then we can talk." The entire section of the journal from the first time the inspector met Mere to her disappearance was my favorite section. I had read it so many times I could recite it frommemory. The section I handed her was where Mere explained her past, as a vampyr from the time of Imhotep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She pushed the journal away once she finished and looked at me. "This can't be serious.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, it is true." She slid the book across the desk. "My aunt left this to me. She said it came down through my mother's family."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I scanned the page she had open. There was an account that painted the same picture of the opening. It didn't have the private moments before or after, but the museum event details were the same.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know what happened to her? Why she disappeared? She broke her brother's heart."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How much is in this about Angelique?" I asked, motioning to the journal she had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much after the death of their parents. The Wellinghams would have taken him in, however, his mother's family insisted he stay with them. He didn't have much contact with Angelique after that, although, he made a couple of entries about Angelique seeming different after the murders."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* why is Ariana researching her past now? Does this story tie in with Jasmine in Seattle? How does this link to the Hut or does it? Part of Ariana's fascination will be with Angelique Marsters - Ariana is a descendent of Edward Marsters, Angelique' Marsters step-brother - remember Prague Cabal, definitely a secret group - "secret world" kinds of things definitely going on in the underlayer of the Ascendency world, left overs from the Stonehenge gate project and other occult happenings in this realm */</p>
