<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tommy had shown Yasmine and Chris a secret way out of the Arcology through the maintenance levels. It is how they slipped out to see the pre-quake area.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Include stuff from Tleiran 12 story that fits - much does not - this story does involve the Hut system crash and rebuild scenario as part of the threading</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider whether to keep the threading model from the original start or scrap it for something more traditional</p>

<p class="regtxt5">How does Yasmine fit into this, or does she? She is located in the Seattle area - original thoughts were she was key to a Hut fix/rebuild</p>

<p class="regtxt5">YW arcology in Chiba City is just outside the area the quake destroyed. create arcology footprint for Chiba site of Yamasa Walhedra</p>

<p class="regtxt5">DONE: Copy chapter 1 of Sienna (from Ellie folder) to a new place for her and update name to Yasmine
Continue story there - that way if either Joint Author wants to sart up again, it becomes a Parallel Realm Story</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Currently, plan this as if it is in the Cyberpunk realm of Angelique Lestrade and Shadowrun, Black Tokyo, and Motoko Kusanagi's Tokyo</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Place in a Tokyo clone where an earthquake took out an industrial section</p>

<p class="regtxt5">What else does she find in the depths of the building? Partial labs, some sort of additional clue?
Where would she go from here?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">her search could take her to London and the archives at Letrade & Petrie Booksellers - these archives are world famous among serious historical researchers</p>

<p class="regtxt5">others are researching strange rumors on how the Mega-Corp Ascendency began. Officially, the creation of the ITC conglomerate, in the 1890's, is seen as the start of the process. Since many strange things are hinted at in this period of history, there are several groups very interested in finding more details.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">others are searching for DCM clues and trying to keep any events quiet - there have been a few incursions over the years and a few clues periodically left. Example - the removal ov Tracy from a dig site and Elena from a nuke plant accident</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Endgame - does she find the Death City Metro, the Hut, or anything at all?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">does Mina become Vampyr and retain control of ITC? - this could be interesting in terms of kick-starting rumors</p>

<p class="regtxt5">does Lucy marry Lestrade and produce children? Would she retain controlling interests in ITC with Mina and would these interests remain with the Lestrade heirs?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">CONSIDER: re-write the Hut Arrival in 2066 - return the arrival to the Phoenix Garden site</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/diane_l.htm">Diane Lestrade</a> */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Chief Inspector Diane Lestrade levered herself out of the office chair, turned and stared out the grimy window of her offce. It was grey and rainy, just like it had been for the last week. Six floors below her the street was a darker blakness in the fading light. Only a few street lights still worked, forming tiny pools in the black. She glanced back at the sreen full of data on her desk and her mouth twisted in a bitter smile. Low end cases for the gdregs that had fallen through the mega-corp net. Anything with substanc would be handled by the corporate private security groups, leaving only the vague street crimes for Scotland Yard to work on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned back to the desk, swept a thin stack of real papers into a battered bag and turned off the monitor. The papers held notes on a strange series of homeless deaths. Garrett Cavanaugh had been slipping her details of the organ harvesting he had seen during the routine autopsies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She shrugged into a heavy, worn, black leather duster, turned off the office lights and made her way to the street by way of the stairs. Long ago she had come to distrust the creaky, poorly maintained elevator that served the slowly decaying building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A thin drizzle accompanied the grey, bringing another bitter smile. London was known for fog and rain, but she still tired of the stereotypical behavior. A couple minutes walk took her to the tube. Fifteen minutes later she was in Whitechapel, headed to Lestrade and Petrie Booksellers and her small apartment above it. Her brother and his family ran the business that had been in the family since Inspector Geoffrey Lestrade and his friend Dr. John Petrie had started it in the late 1890s.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She opened the door and entered the common area, intending to ask her niece Angelique about the cases. Angelique was already talking to another street rat. They slipped in all the time, looking for cheap connection points or places that didn't heavily monitor their traffic. Deciding to wait until later, she waved at Angelique as she walked to the private door behind the counter. Angelique looked up, waved briefly, and went back to her conversation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her steps were heavy as she trudged up to her small apartment, at the top of the building. She shrugged the coat off and left it in a heap by the door on her way to dropping into a worn recliner. She rolled her head back and stared up at the ceiling and through the skylight, into the drizzling rain, for along time. At last she leaned forward, unlaced her boots and tugged them off. Barefoot, she paced to the tiny kitchen, popped open the fridge door and stared at the lack of food. Moments later she closed it, crossed back to the chair and sat back down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She flipped her comm unit on, scrolled through her contacts, and stabbed one. A male voice ansered on the third ring, "Cavanaugh."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Garrett, it's Lestrade. Have you had dinner?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I just got in, so no. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you like to meet at the Moroccan Moon?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds better than what's in my place. Sure. When?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"About thirty minutes? I'm headed there from home." She pushed her feet back into her damp boots and shrugged into her duster on the way out the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Downstairs Angelique's mom was at the counter. They waved at each other as she headed out the door and back to the tube station.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ibrahim Raizul smiled as she walked in. "Good evening, Chief Inspector. Mr. Cavanaugh is already seated. Would you like to see menues or shall I bring you both your usuals?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's Diane, Ibrahim. We've known each other how long now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Eight years, Chief Inspector. Maybe when we have know each other nine years, then I'll feel comfortable with such informality."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His refusal to change how he greated her always made her smile, and took ten years of wear off her face. He studied her, noting the deeper lines around her eyes and mouth, the tired sadness in her eyes, and the hint of grey creeping into her dirty blonde hair.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She studied him in return, thinking, as always, that he should be leading a band of raiders across the desert. Or lounging in a large tent, passing judgement on his tribe as chieftain or prince. "The usuals would be wonderful, Ibrahim."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very good. I will show you to Mr. Cavanaugh, then get the orders ready. The usual drinks as well?" She nodded and followed him into the depths of the restaurant. It was very traditional, with low tables and cushions on the floor. In a small back alcove Garrett Cavanaugh was already seated, sipping a mint tea.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Diane," he said in his rough, gravely voice, as she settled onto another cushion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Garrett," she answered. He was not a handsome man. His face was a long oval, with a narrow chin and prominent nose. His ears were large and stuck out from his close cropped, balding skull. His normally lively eyes were sunken and tired as he looked over at her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There was another one today. Found tangled in the old pilings just outside the Hyperdyne Battersea facility. Same as the others, no identification, no implants or tracking systems, just a drained and empty body. I'll get you the details tomorrow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And corp security didn't care?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nope, they didn't care at all. Hyperdyne, wasn't that the group your ex went to work for? The ones who aoffered you a position?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm still surprised you didn't take it. You and Richard would still be together and the money would be much better."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There were already issues between us. He wanted a steady home-life, with children, and for me to work a steady pay, predictable hours job so he could be home with them. I don't want children and I want to help everyone, not just those attached to a mega-corp. Last I heard, he was looking to marry some high level exec and get the family of his dreams. I truly wish him well, even though it sounds like hell to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The arrival of their food put an end to convresation as they ate the perfectly prepared food. Ibrahim kept their tea full and served each course at the precise times when they were ready. It was a dance the three of them had perfected over the eight years they had known each other.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When they were finished, they tried to pay the actual cost of the meal. Ibrahim refused, charging half pice as always, citing the help both had given to he and his wife when they first met. Once the ritual was finished, They stepped out into the thin rain. "Nightcap, Diane?" Garrett asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure." They walked north to Garrett's flat, just off St. Giles Passage, where it ended at the Phoenix Garden. They were about to enter the glass and steel doors of Garrett's building when Lestrade stopped and looked toward the park. Two figures were staggering along the path, even though the park was clearly posted that it was closed after dark.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stay here. Be ready to call for backup," Diane hissed. She pulled a stun baton from her coat and slipped toward the park. She stopped breifly at the gate, long enough to ease it open. The figures resolved into two women, a tall, rail thin one was supporting a shorter, dark skinned, average built one as the moved slowly along the path. Both were dressed in loose trousers and tunic tops. The thin woman wore all black while the other wore more colorful and elegant versions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Metropolitan Police, what are you doing here? The park is closed after hours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sorry officer, we are new here and lost," said the thin one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where are you staying? Where are you coming from?" Diane asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where are we? When are we?" the other woman mummbled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is your friend ok? What does she mean when are we? What is she on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's nothing, she's just had a bit too much to drink."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where are we?" the other one asked, more forcefully.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are in the Phoenix Garden. Where are you staying?" Diane asked again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where is the Phoenix Garden?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are in the Phoenix Garden, Camden Town, London. Now, where are you staying?" Diane demanded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"32 Flower and Dean Street, no, 221B Baker Street. I moved in with, with Inspector Lestrade, Geofrey Lestrade," The other woman answered, seeming confused.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She didn't see Diane stiffen, but the thin woman did. "What is it, officer?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Diane was staring at them, at the thin woman in front of her and the other woman with an elaborate tattoo peeking out from under the top of the tunic. "It can't be," she muttered. "What are your names?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am Shandi. This is Mereret. Who are you?" the thin woman answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Diane Lestrade," Diane answered as she sagged against the fence at her back. "You can't be. They disappeared in the 1890s."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Diane Lestrade? This London, when is it?" Shandi asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is 2066."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Diane, you ok? I'm going to call this in," Garret called.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, wait. I'm good. No need to call it in. Why are you here? What's going on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We need your help," Shandi replied. "Our home is badly damaged and we need to find out how to fix it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hungry," Mereret mummbled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shh, love. There's food in the Hut. Do you remember where, or do I need to take you to it?" Shan wrapped her amrs around the slumped figure.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can't think. Need help," Mereret said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait for me, please?" Shandi asked Diane, who nodded once.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Garret hurried over as soon as the two moved away. "Diane, what's going on? Who are those people? Why did you let them go?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What I think should be impossible, so I can't tell you, yet."</p>
