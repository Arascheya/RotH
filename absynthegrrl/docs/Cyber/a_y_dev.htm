<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tommy had shown Yasmine and Chris a secret way out of the Arcology through the maintenance levels. It is how they slipped out to see the pre-quake area.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Include stuff from Tleiran 12 story that fits - much does not - this story does involve the Hut system crash and rebuild scenario as part of the threading</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider whether to keep the threading model from the original start or scrap it for something more traditional</p>

<p class="regtxt5">How does Yasmine fit into this, or does she? She is located in the Seattle area - original thoughts were she was key to a Hut fix/rebuild</p>

<p class="regtxt5">YW arcology in Chiba City is just outside the area the quake destroyed. create arcology footprint for Chiba site of Yamasa Walhedra</p>

<p class="regtxt5">DONE: Copy chapter 1 of Sienna (from Ellie folder) to a new place for her and update name to Yasmine
Continue story there - that way if either Joint Author wants to sart up again, it becomes a Parallel Realm Story</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Currently, plan this as if it is in the Cyberpunk realm of Angelique Lestrade and Shadowrun, Black Tokyo, and Motoko Kusanagi's Tokyo</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Place in a Tokyo clone where an earthquake took out an industrial section</p>

<p class="regtxt5">What else does she find in the depths of the building? Partial labs, some sort of additional clue?
Where would she go from here?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">her search could take her to London and the archives at Letrade & Petrie Booksellers - these archives are world famous among serious historical researchers</p>

<p class="regtxt5">others are researching strange rumors on how the Mega-Corp Ascendency began. Officially, the creation of the ITC conglomerate, in the 1890's, is seen as the start of the process. Since many strange things are hinted at in this period of history, there are several groups very interested in finding more details.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">others are searching for DCM clues and trying to keep any events quiet - there have been a few incursions over the years and a few clues periodically left. Example - the removal ov Tracy from a dig site and Elena from a nuke plant accident</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Endgame - does she find the Death City Metro, the Hut, or anything at all?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">does Mina become Vampyr and retain control of ITC? - this could be interesting in terms of kick-starting rumors</p>

<p class="regtxt5">CONSIDER: re-write the Hut Arrival in 2066 - return the arrival to the Phoenix Garden site</p>
