<p class="pagecaption">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The cold rain had started as soon as Yasmine entered the forbidden section of Old City. It dripped down her back, pinged off old metal sheeting, and sucked the warmth from the air around her. This was the first time she had ventured here alone since Tommy had disappeared the night the earthquake had struck. They had been searching the edges for anything interesting when he had seen the lights deeper down the empty street. She remembered him running toward them, waving for her to follow, "Come on, I bet it's Chris and his buddies." But it hadn't been Chris, who had appeared from a street on the left after Tommy had run deeper in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It had been the night of the quake. The city had enough warning to get everyone out, at least that's what the officials had said. Yasmine still wondered, remembering the shouts in the distance, "Get to the train. They're coming, fall back." Tommy had run toward the lights and the noise, leaving her waiting behind. She and Chris had waited as long as they could, running just before the quake hit. The sounds of splintering buildings and falling rubble still echoed in her mind. They had waited for Tommy, even after, but he had never returned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now, three days later, her footsteps haltingly retraced his path. He had run forward three blocks, then turned to the right. She played her light uneasily over the wreckage around her. Before it was abandoned for the quake, this section of the city had been industrial and commercial buildings. In the aftermath the buildings leaned dangerously and glass shards sent stray reflections dancing in the seeping rain. Ahead the side street was a darker black in the already dark night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yasmine followed her light into the side street. Half a block down the buildings had toppled in upon themselves, crashed together in a wall blocking the street. Her nervous light played over a flash of silver reflection near the last standing building before the tumble. It slowly resolved into a dropped light, just like hers, as she moved closer. It was pointing at a shattered door into the standing building. She picked it up and saw Tommy's initials etched into the base of it. The lens was shattered and a dark stain marked the underside of the deformed lamp housing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fear warred with her curiosity as she tip toed to the shattered door. Her light played over every surface coming to a stop at the hole in the far wall, back behind what had been a reception or security desk. "T..T..Tommy, are you in there?" Her voice sounded thin and empty in the room beyond. Grabbing her lamp harder she stepped into the building. She hissed in surprise as her light played across bloody, bare foot prints leading toward where she stood. She tracked them with the light back to the hole in the wall. She tried to remember the forensic programs she had watched as she slipped closer. It was regular in shape and showed signs of precision explosives. Pipes, conduits, and cables filled the space beyond the hole. A rope was tied off to one of the support brackets and hung down as a safety line.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Water reflected back her light from just below an open access panel several stories below her. Looking up, she could just make out the twisted wreckage of pipes, ducts, and conduits where the rest of the building had fallen down. She swung her feet into the shaft, grabbed the rope in one hand and started to slowly climb down towrad the open panel below. The scent of salt water grew in strength as she dropped closer to the water surface.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A white corridor led away from the open panel. Bloody footprints walked away down it and ran back to the opening. Sienna crept down the hall, shining her light everywhere and seeing only featureless walls and growing fragments of rcok and cement. The bloody footprints turned a corner and ended at a wall of collapsed ceiling. Part of a cloth bag peeked out from the edge. She slowly teased the bag out of the rubble. It was a black canvas bag, about the size of the average gym bag, and completely unremarkable except for an embroidered patch with "DCM" and two crossed red roses.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The climb up the shaft took a lot longer than the climb down. The faintest lightening of the sky announced dawn was not far off when Yasminereached the shattered glass door. Reflections off a larger piece of glass caught her attention. Under it was a perfectly preserved bloody footprint, pointing toward the rubble blocking the street farther down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A quick glance at the time told her she would have to hurry if she wanted to be home before her mom awoke. After a last, long look deeper into the disaster area, she turned and hurried back to the narrow alley holding the stairs to the unmonitored way into the Yamasa Walhedra Arcology. Tommy had shown this way to Chris and her the night they had gone out to explore the quake area, just before it was scheduled to strike.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her timing was perfect, having just slid under the covers when her mom knocked on the door to awaken her. She dragged herself out of bed, dressed, and tried to force herself to look like she had slept. Fortunately, her mom was distracted enough that she didn't notice. After a nearly silent breakfast, she hurried off to her job, leaving Yasmine to her own devices.</p>
