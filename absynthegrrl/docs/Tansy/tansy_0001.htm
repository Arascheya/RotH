<p class="pagecaption">The Beginning</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I grew up in a poorer than peasants family. My father was a thief, although not a very good one. He had his hand removed when I was a baby when he tried to pick the pocket of the wrong man. My mother was a sweet but simple woman who put up with my father's schemes and moods. She had apprenticed me to the village healer and wise woman, Meg, called Mad Meg by those seeking the blessings of the priest Oswald. Meg had a second aprentice, a girl a few years older than me, named Gwendolyn, who was the miller's daughter. She was more conventional than I was, but not quite as quick to learn. Meg taught both of us to defend ourselves, on the quiet, since we could all be burned for it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everyone in the family was expected to steal when possible. My earliest memories are of my father showing me how to slip small items off merchant tables. He would explain new methods and targets as I grew older. I expected to continue until I married and had children of my own to care for.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was sixteen when my father changed all that. He sold me to a traveling peddler for the price of a horse. At first I couldn't believe it. It wasn't until my hands were tied behind me and a lead rope tied around my waist that it became real. I tried to protest, yelling to anyone nearby but the town constable and the priests sided with my father. As we approached the edge of the village I struggled against the rope, pulling, hauling, and yanking against it until my captor slammed his fist into my guts, doubling me over. "Hold still, cunt. You're mine now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Things became much worse once we left the village. My new owner dragged me into the nearby forest and to a clearing where another woman was tied to the trees. She stared at the ground in front of her, blood stained the front of her dress and her face showed bruises and small cuts. While I watched, a man stood from near the fire, walked over to her, grabbed her legs, and hauled her to a laying position. He shoved her dress up to her waist, hoisted his tunic, and entered her. She didn't even move, just laying there as he sawed in and out of her. As he neared climax, he slapped her, shouting, "Move damn you." She remained motionless as he slapped her face, rocking her head back and forth. He stiffened, grunted, and slumped down long moments later. He hauled her dress back down and left her to struggle back into a sitting position.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My purchaser shoved his face near mine and said, "I hope you're more spirited than her." He pushed me to an empty tree and tied my rope to it. "Hey boys, we have a fresh one. I get her first, then the rest of you can draw lots for the next in line."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tried to fight against him when he came for me, but it did no good. He hauled my legs apart and shoved into me. Pain exploded in unbearable waves. A short hot pain as he took my virginity, then rough scraping pain as he sawed through my dry flesh. My mind started to drift back and away, felling through a distant haze as my body started to react and make moisture. He squirted his loathsome load into me and pulled away. His residue let the next one slip in with less pain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This time my body started to respond sooner, but I didn't, drawing back deeper into the recesses of my mind. I would have prayed, but I never believed what the church had said. It preached obedience and humility, yet its servants and the nobility used the rest of us as they liked, in ways counter to what they said they believed. With the reduced pain I drifted farther, not really called back by the slow responses my body was giving.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wanted to give up, relax into madness, and forget what was happening. For a moment, it felt like I could, then the rage came, bubbling up from a dark pit at the center of me. Ice flowed from the black, chilling and calming me, separating the pain of my flesh from what I was.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alone in the darkness I started to plot how to get free. I had seen one of them lead the other girl off into the woods when she had to make water. It took longer than expected which meant either she did more than make water or the thug took advantage of the time with her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My captors started in on the barrel of beer as soon as they were finished with me. I lay there raw, aching, oozing, and realizing if I was going to empty my water, it would have to be soon, before they were too drunk to lead me away. "Hey, I have to make water, unless you want me to smell like piss all night."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cunt," a tall man grumbled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll take her," said the second man to rape me. He untied my rope and pulled me up. Pain shot from pulled muscles and raw skin. I whimpered as he almost dragged me into the dark trees. He stopped when we were just about out of sight of the fire.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'll have to hold my dress, unless you untie my hands." For a moment he hesitated, then roughly reached and undid the rope. He grabbed my upper right arm and let me lower myself and hike up my dress.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As I finished I shot my foot out and connected with his private parts. Instead of letting go as I had hoped, he clamped down on my arm as he doubled over. "Bitch!" he hissed, yanking me toward him. As I fell into him my left hand brushed the dagger at his waist. I yanked it out and thrust blindly at him. I hit something, then his fist crashed into the side of my face. I dropped to my knees, waving the dagger around. He cocked his fist again and I thrust up, feeling the resistance of cloth. In desperation I shoved up with my whole body. Blood erupted, splashing over my hand and into my face. I twisted and even more blood sprayed out. He sank back, blood spraying, then flowing, from the long tear in his inner thigh.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the dim light of the moon, I looked at the body in front of me. As the urgency faded, the shakes hit. I emptied the thin contents of my stomach over his body. Then elation hit. I was less prepared for it than for the shakes and upset. I raised his dagger to the stars and almost howled in triumph until I remembered the camp.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I turned to run, then thought of the other girl, with her sightless eyes and empty expression. The icy anger returned and turned me back toward the camp. I circled, to approach from where the trees were thickest and almost ran straight into the sentry. My father had taught me well in the art of quiet and I made it to the tree he was leaning against without any sound betraying me. He was half asleep, leaning against the tree and looking more toward camp than back along the path from the road.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He became aware of me when the knife cut deep into his throat. I had cut from behind, but when the blood sprayed I darted in front of him, wanting to feel his loathsome life flood out. The shakes weren't as bad this time, although I tried to empty my guts again. I grabbed his knife and started back to the camp.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I took my time, staring at the camp from the thick trees. Most of the men were half asleep from drink. No one seemed to have missed the one I left with. The other girl was near the edge of the light. The man watching her was flat on his back, snoring. It took a long while, but I managed to work my way around and slip up behind the tree she was tied to. She didn't even blink when I leaned around and whispered, "I am going to cut you loose and give you a knife. Then I'm going to take care of these pigs." Her hands dropped limply to her sides and refused to close over the knife handle. I left it near her and slid toward the man near her. I was able to cut his throat without him making any noise.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Made bolder by my success, I darted to the next closest figure. I wasn't as lucky and he got off a partial shout before I finished. Two stumbled to their feet and staggered toward me. I danced back, but stumbled on a rock, going down hard. The first one landed on me and I was able to get the knife into his leg. He rolled off, howling in pain as blood pulsed from the wound. The second man kicked at my face. I twisted, but his boot caught me with a glancing blow. My vision swam as I tried to regain my senses. His fist swung toward my face and I dropped back, just managing to get out of the way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He screamed and fell back with the other girl driving the dagger into his throat from behind. Her first cut was too shallow, but the second wasn't. That left three men, fanning out and facing us. The leader spoke, "Put the knives down girlies, before Sven puts arrows into you." The third man was stringing his bow. With a desperate shout I charged at him. Pain exploded from my side and I stumbled, but managed to reach the bowman. I let my momentum carry me forward and into him. My blade entered just under his ribs and ripped down to his groin as I fell. His insides spilled out over me, as I slid into the dark.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I didn't die, but I didn't wake up for a long while either. Strange dreams, dark and twisted, haunted me as I struggled to wake up. A white haired woman with red eyes, spiders of impossible sizes, warmth, cold, and voices, speaking in strange languages, all drifted through. The one that remained solidly in my mind was the dream of small spiders crawling under my skin, in and through my insides, chewing and weaving webs and chewing some more. I tried to wake enough to scream, but I couldn't.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The distinctive smell of long dead bodies woke me. I was on my back, staring up at the leaves of a large tree. To my right the girl was struggling to wakefulness. As I slowly sat up I saw the bodies of our captors spread out where they had fallen. Animals had started to strip them of flesh and it looked like days had passed since their deaths.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I whipped my head around at a light touch, seeing only the other girl. She swept leaves away from a small section of dirt and scratched marking into it. "Can you read?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A little," I responded. Meg, the village herbalist, had been teaching me as part of my training in her craft.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am Tala," she wrote.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tansy. Thank you for helping me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What village are you from?" Tala wrote.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tissan's Holding, you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mashal, near the lord's hold."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Taegaff? The same swine who holds my village. My father sold me to these...things. How did you get here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The priest gave me to them, after I refused to confess to witchery. He was going to burn me, but these offered him good money for a mute prize. Many would pay for someone who couldn't complain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The words were without emotion, being written in the dirt, but they kindled a cold fury. "We should make them pay!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How? They are the law, the lords and the priests."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know herbs that can bring sleep, venoms that can paralyse and kill, and flowers that can bring dreams and terrors. I owe the 'man' that spawned me for what he's done to my mother, my sisters, and my youngest brother."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Revenge never ends well," Tala wrote.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Neither does the life of a woman in these times. They can only kill me once, but I can take some with me. They say the saints have servants in heaven, well, I want hand-maidens in hell. I am going to take down the puss bag that was my father. Do you want to go after the priest of your village?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would, but the lord will come searching if anything happens to him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then we kill him too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you mad? He is never seen without guards."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I am mad. I can use a bow and with the right stuff on arrow-tips I can take enough before they get to me." Our discussions went on into the dark of night. I explained the plants we would need and how to prepare them. When sleep at last claimed us, we had the beginnings of a plan.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took long days of sneking through the forest to gather the needed items. Then more days to prepare the toxins. As we worked I learned Tala could understand the moods of the world. She helped us avoid discovery, calmed wild beasts when we came too near, and could find the best places to hunt the herbs, roots, and insects I needed to create the various poisons I wanted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* original thought - taken to somewhere else and left */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The sounds of running water woke me. I was in a shallow cave with a bubbling spring in the back. A stream flowed past, through the narrow entry, and into late afternoon sunshine. The floor was water worn rock and the ceiling was tall enough I would be able to stand up. A dark opening led further back into the rock, just to the side of the spring.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The girl sat next to the spring. She looked up as I sat next to her and scratched in the sand. "Can you read?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A little," I replied. Meg, the village herbalist, had been teaching me as part of my training in her lore.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She scratched out, "I'm Nayya. You are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tansy," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you bring us here?" Nayya asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I thought you brought me here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then who?" I shrugged back at her. "See where we are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I nodded and we walked to the entry of the cave. The stream flowed out, across a small clearing and down a steep gully. </p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* update - her escape should be hers alone, Ishra should appear to her after she gets herself free - could be before or after freeing Nayya */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* should be half deliberate and half accident - she kills him, but maybe wasn't quite ready to do so - she will react as first time killer - then has to decide not to run, instead returning to kill the rest and free the other - the rage has dimmed to an icy anger that prompts the decision to kill them all */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Deeper in the dark a figure strolled into view, or maybe faded, I couldn't be sure. The figure was tall, slender, and moved with an easy grace. As it drew closer I saw a woman, in the prime of her life, black skinned, with bone white hair. Her eyes were red, her face stunning, and her ears were long and pointed. She smiled as she came closer and lowered herself to sit at my feet. "hello, young one." Her voice was low, sweet, and calm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hadn't been afraid until she spoke to me. Then I took a step back and said, "Get away from me, Satan!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She laughed and continued to sit. "Satan? Is he someone I should know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I won't be tempted," I said strongly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She laughed again, I'm not here to tempt you, I'm here to help you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At what price, my immortal soul?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that the price of help these days? I really should get out more. Rest easy, I have no desire for your soul. The taking or donating of a soul is a very difficult and precise event and requires full cooperation from the donor. What I do not like, however, are men who think women are property and exist only for their uses. That is why I have come to offer aid."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In case you hadn't noticed, I am being raped at the moment. Couldn't you have come sooner?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You had to be in a place where I could contact you. And I can't directly interfere. The godling of your world cannot know of me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My head spun at her words. My education had been in a bit of scripture, stealing, and caring for house and home. While I could almost understand the words, I couldn't understand the meaning and shook my head. "I don't understand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You will, in time. For now, I can offer you a way to help yourself, but it will require you to be very strong and clever."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My voice trembled as I asked, "What are you offering and what would I have to do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There will be a large spider web off the trail where they take you to make water. You need to fall through it and take the large egg in the center and swallow it. Doing this will allow me to talk directly to you, without the need for the current unpleasantness. It will also give you abilities that will help you escape and free the other woman. I will explain more in the morning."</p>
