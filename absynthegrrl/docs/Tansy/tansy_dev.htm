<p class="regtxt5">Mad Meg - Magdalene</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Mad Meg, born Magdalene, is the third <a href="../../gm_resources/info/sisters_web.htm">Sister of the Web</a>. She was the village herbalist and had been training Tansy and the miller's daughter, Gwendlyn, as the only herbalist in the village village. Tansy and Tala had to rescue Meg from the village priest, Oswald, who was going to burn her for witchcraft. They killed the priest - cutting his dick off, letting him die from shock and blood loss, stuffing it in his mouth, and nailing him upside down on the symbol of his god on a stick.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mar, Marta - Martalaine</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Martalaine is the fourth <a href="../../gm_resources/info/sisters_web.htm">Sister of the Web</a>. She functions as the balancer for the Sisters, realizing there are a few good priests and a few good nobles and urging data gathering before wholesale killings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thalasa - Tala</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Thalasa is the second <a href="../../gm_resources/info/sisters_web.htm">Sister of the Web</a>. She was in the slaver encampment when Tansy was brought in and the first person Tansy rescued. Tala was enslaved by the priest of her village for not becoming a proper woman. They will return to their villages to exact revenge for their fates after killing the slavers. From then on they help other women and kill priests and nobility whenever possible.</p>
