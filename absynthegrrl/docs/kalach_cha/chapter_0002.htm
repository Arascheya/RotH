<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was working a shift in the Neutral Zone, the tavern in a section of the Asylum basements, when things changed again. It was close to the end of my shift when I glanced over at the invisible table. There was a table, in an alcove, that no one ever sat at. It didn't matter how crowded the rest of the Deep Hall was, it was never used. I almost dropped the tray of drinks I was carrying when I saw someone sitting at it. Once I had passed out the drinks, I looked again and saw the stranger had been joined by Alys, a street girl who usually came in to the shelter in the evenings. That was another service the Asylum ran, a shelter for the street kids of Sphere. It gave them a safe place to sleep, good food, and a break from the streets. Alys was one who come in most nights, then would leave in the morning to earn a few coins as a guide around the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I approached the table to ask if they wanted anything and overheard Alys say, "Share my cookie? It's called oatmeal rasin and it's my favoretest in the whole world. Course I have to steal them cuz they're too 'spensive for me to buy." She carefully unfolded the greasy paper wrapping and broke the cookie into perfect halves. She handed half to the stranger, who reached for it with her right hand. On her ring finger was a more ornate copy of the ring I was wearing. I opened my mouth to speak just as the woman took a bite.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The world froze in place and shattered. Drinks were raised half to the lips of several patrons as everything disintgrated into streamers and threads of vibrating color. Conciousness expanded, and with it stabbing, crushing pain, until I could feel an ant pushing a rock, somewhere, while a tree crashed to a forest somewhere else. In the center of the streamers floated two brilliant points of light. One spoke and for a moment I saw Alys pull two small glasses and a flask from her tattered clothes. She powered bilious green slime into both and passed one to the woman. "Take a sip, then a bite of cookie, then a sip, finishing everything with the drink. It will settle your head," she said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The woman, whose name I suddenly knew was Irena Katarya, took a sip of liquid and the pain lessened as the images intensified. I was floating within a circle with two others in the blackest void of space. Between us floated a ball of brilliant white light and a globe of absolute darkness. We were chanting strange sounds, as we reached a cresendo the white light began to spew tendrils of flaming stuff while the black sphere collapsed into a deep well of nothingness. The tendrils fell slowly into the dark. "Welcome back, sister," Alys said to Irena. Imposed on Alys was a face of cold beauty. Her skin was grey, her hair white. "Finish your cookie and we will talk." She turned to me and motioned to the empty third chair. "Sit with us, Ghanima Sherzada." Alys broke off a small piece of her cookie and set her glass in front of me. "You are connected. Have a bit of cookie, then take a sip. It will help, I promise."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The cookie was exquisite, and the slime, well, it was slimy, but it did help. When I had finished both, I could see the Neutral Zone and the people in it. Around them were tendrils and streamers, and, with concentration, I could learn a little about each one. There was a strong tendril stretching from my ring to the ring on Irena's finger.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irena spoke as I was trying to form a question, "Sister, you have broken your own laws. You have invited a Power into your city."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, they are more guidelines, actually, but you are right, there will be a price, but there always is, isn't there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are," I started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No one notices Alys," She replied. "You will find you are unable to tell anyone, unless they already know. The Asylum Mistress Irishkah knows of me because the Asylum head has a unique place in Sphere. It sits over the primary node that maintains Sphere and the shadows that maintain the city live deep beneath these halls. They answer to the Asylum Mistress, who answers to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why? How?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your ring is tied to my sister's ring. Her enlightenment has spilled onto you, and onto her other close associates. It is more burden than blessing. You will be more visible to those seeking power."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then the legends are true," I said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You see the sisters' table because you are tied to one of us. Everyone else sees a simple corner. Now, it is time to resume the flow, don't you think?" She waited until Irena and I had nodded. "Ghani, would you bring Miss Lady and me absynthe and black plum brandy? You can join us, if you like. Miss Lady will be paying."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I returned to the bar, slowly and in a daze. Ashrak, a fire demonic and bartender, noticed when it took me three tries to get through the order. "Ghani, you could have taken the night off. Everyone knows about earlier today."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, Ash, but I thought this would help me work through it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I give you your favorite, then you sit down, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, Ash, I'll deliver this last order and call it for the night, sound good?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very good, Ghani. You be well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I took the drinks back and sat with Alys and Irena until I had finished mine. "Stay a bit longer. I want to talk with Irishkah and you should be there." Alys said when I started to rise.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* steps through and emerges at the hidden table, triggering memories of when she was last at the table */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* is someone at the table to grab her as her memories hit or does she collapse by herself? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Fire rippled from the middle finger of my right hand and my lungs started working again. There was a curious hitch as the diaphragm slid up and down the knife blade. He twisted and a spurt of blood spilled over his hand then stopped. He twisted again and again and each time there was only a little bit of blood. "Why won't you die, you worthless whore?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His voice broke the paralysis of pain, warmth, pain that I was enthralled by. Rage snapped my hands around his neck and forced my fingers together, through the thick muscles. His eyes were glazing over and his hands dropping from the dagger in my guts as the protectors burst into the room. They had to pry my fingers from his neck. My arms dropped to my sides and I stared at the dagger hilt, jumping and leaving a tiny burst of pain and warmth with each breath. I gingerly touched it, feeling it move, then gritted my teeth, pulled, then tugged, then jerked until it popped free. There was another spurt of blood, another jolt of pain, and then warmth. Within seconds the wound had closed. The scar going from ragged, to angry red, to a thin white line, and fading entirely as I slumped backward. I would have fallen if the protectors hadn't rushed forward and caught me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One of them carried me back to my rooms, laid me on my bed and carefully cleaned the blood and other things from me. I had just pulled the sheet up when Irishkah, the madame and head of The Asylum, entered, crossed to the bed, and sat on the edge of it. Her normally open and expressive face was closed and serious as she sat down. Nervously, I began twisting the imaginary ring on my middle finger, stopping when I felt cool metal under my touch, and staring at the intricately worked, wide silver band. Twirling an imaginary ring had been an odd nervous twitch of mine from childhood, one that I had been teased about for many years.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you like to talk about what happened, Ghani?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know where the knife came from. I didn't see it. How did he get it past the doors?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good questions, all. Ones we will be addressing. I was wondering how you survived and how you are doing, though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know," I replied as I slowly raised my hand until it was near her face, "This did it, I think." I stared at the smooth expanse of my belly where the dagger should have left a scar. "I don't now how I am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did it? All I see is your finger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You, you don't see the ring I am wearing?" my voice shook even more as I looked at the ring and brought my other hand up to touch it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, Ghani, I'm afraid I don't. Would you mind if I had Niansa use her magic to take a look?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I shook my no and she sent the protector for her. Niansa came in a few minutes later, a wizened old woman, bent almost double with some strange bone disease, with dirty grey hair, and wrinkled face. Magic could have healed her, but she was terrified it would damage her own skills in some way. Irishkah respected her wishes and had not insisted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Niansa stared at my finger for a long time, pulled out a small, perfect, brilliant green emerald and touched it to where the ring was. There was a small flare of icy cold and the ring flashed into visibility. Irishkah's eye brows rose swiftly. "I have seen one of these once before, on a wretched creature, prowling the streets of Sphere, searching for She Who Must Never Be Named," Niansa whispered. Silence, seeming deeper than the quiet already in the room, dropped over us. Everyone knew of She..., the mythical, invisible ruler of Sphere. She... could kill with a glance, turning the hapless victim inside out in a fountaining gout of blood and fluids, or toss them into a trans-dimensional maze from which there was no escape. For anyone to actively seek She... was a tacit admission of suicidal intent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Fleshfeaster," Irishkah said quietly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, the very same," Niansa replied. "Only one of her blood could wear something like this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What does it do?" Irishkah and I asked at the same instant.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is no way to know all that it can do. It is wrapped in a magical encryption so complex that it would take life-times to unravel. There are a couple of aspects that are visible. It will regenerate Ghani from any and all harm. It also appears to be sending some kind of location data to another artifact. If you have no further need of me, I will see if I can find out anything more about this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing further, Niansa. Please keep us informed." Irishkah moved up the bed until she could rest my head against her arm and moved my arm for a better view of the ring. The shakes hit as soon as she touched me. I felt and saw the knife, over and over, plunging in, pain and healing, pain and healing, in an endless loop. Softly, from a distance, a voice called, followed by a vague sensation. I clung to the voice, trying to escape the loop, pulling myself back along the voice, then the touch. I have no idea how long Irishkah held me and called to me before I returned. When I started to apologize, she silenced me and held me tighter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ghani, are you with us now?" Slowly I nodded. "Good!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Running footsteps sounded in the hall. A second later Irulan dashed into the room and slid to a stop at the foot of my bed. "I just heard. Are you ok? Oh, mistress, I'm sorry," she dropped into a deep bow at the sight of Irishkah.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is ok, Irulan. I shall leave you to your lover in a moment, once I am sure she will remain with us." She held me in her arms for a few minutes more, scanning my eyes and watching me to see if I was going to slip away again. Once she was sure, she slipped from the bed and headed for the door, turning back to say, "Call me if anything troubles you or if you remember anything about your attacker."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irulan and I watched her leave, staring at her like we always did. She was the hottest woman either of us knew, standing just over five foot ten, with short, spiky grey hair, dark red eyes, a long but well shaped face crowned with two tiny horns curving up from her forehead, and an acrobatic body with perfect curves. Once she was out of sight, Irulan flung herself on the bed and gathered me in her arms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Alys and Ghani talk to Irishkah, Irulan doesn't know about Alys yet */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By then I had recovered enough to make my way through the kitchen and service passageways back to my room. Irulan looked up from a large book as I walked in. "Long shift tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Weird shift tonight." I started to describe the evening to her. When I reached the part about Alys and Irena, she grabbed my hand and started pulling me toward the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Irishakh needs to hear this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But it's the middle of the night," I protested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She will want to know." Irulan dragged me through the halls and up to the very top of the Asylum. Irishkah had a palatial suite in a large tower section, overlooking the Great Souk. At this time of night you could see scattered lights from the Souk and from the rest of Sphere, across the space. Sphere is exactly that, a gigantic sphere circling a timy source of heat and light. You could look up through the sky and see the far side of the city hanging above you. Irulan knocked on the door and then went right in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ghani has something to tell you," Irulan said without waiting for Irishkah to say anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't want to disturb you," I started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ghanima, you had best tell me." I took a breath and launched into my night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She waited quietly until I finished. "So the old legends are coming true. The three Greater Powers only come together when there is a serious threat to the entire multiverse." There are three true gods, the Greater Powers, sometimes called the Three Sisters. They have existed from before time and will exist at the very end. Unlike most "gods", they don't need the power of worshippers to keep them in existence. They are above, beyond, and outside the petty squabbles that make up god, godling, and other factions of the temporal races.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* only Ghani can see the ring - she describes it to Niansa who recognizes it from the recruitment of Klktzash */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* the ring will start feeding her dreams about her past and about the Hut, starting with Margla and a demon lover, and with Home 0 on the Discord */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Ghani will become an Asylum special operative, tasked with missions to protect asylum interests and goals */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she will find out her friend Irulan is also an operative */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
