<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Responds from anger. Will take the shortest path, and cares little how many lives are lost in the process. Has no difficulty killing anyone in his way. Will risk losing someone valuable rather than attempt negotiation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When he arrived at the Mad Techno's place, he remained pleasant and accomodating until he learned of the brain scan device in the lab. Once he understood how to use it, he captured the Mad Techno, emptied his mind of all knowledge, then killed him. He implanted the knowledge in his own mind and used it to jump-start his technological empire.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Need to figure out how he captures Ishra and manages to use the brain scan to subdue her. Remember, this will annoy the Keeper, she considers Ishra a friend.</p>
