 he encountered in a park a violent incident between two mortals. He intervened in this incident, resulting in, as described to me, the nonlethal incapacitation of the aggressor mortal; he is also known to have profited from this altercation to an unknown 
but seemingly significant sum of money. This is consistent with my observations of him seeming to have elevated access to mortal finances, such as brand-new clothes he was not in possession of when I last saw him; however, I believe that the material gain 
was incidental, and my brother acted out of sympathy to the mortal whom he believed would have been killed. While the use of physical force against mortals is inappropriate and unacceptable, I believe that this incident, if isolated, is not indicative of a
ny downwards trend of my brother's ability to obey the laws, and request that he not be punished for this incident, nor his exile extended.\'81\'68}

The human body can easily withstand the rapid drop 
in pressure from 1 atm to 0 atm; the angelic body is if anything, more tough; and nigh-indestructible while unsealed, to boot. Rumisiel did not lose consciousness for the same reason; with his seals broken, he doesn't need to breathe, and can just as handi
ly dance in orbit as at the bottom of the Marianas Trench.}

He teleported a hundred miles closer to the Earth befor
e he started to fall, and in relation to the bright blob of light that is Manhattan, instead of a close relation to the ISS. So instead of moving at 15.55 orbits per day, he was simply dropping from geo-synch on the speed of gravity alone, not shedding the
 energy of multiple rockets expending themselves to put him into orbit. Therefor, he never exceeded terminal velocity, let alone by enough to catch fire.}

However, most of that training involved learning to beat someone upside the head with a club shaped 
suspiciously like the butt of a rifle, or else to stab with a bayonet, or to use a knife. Actual fist-fighting was not taught much, and even further compounding the fact is that he never came to rely upon those skills. So while his memory of the training m
ay be crystal, he never really developed it into a skill. It does give him a slight edge, but not much moreso than, say, Ash has, from getting into the occasional brawl at Tempest High. Even directing as much energy into his physical prowess as he possibly
 could without breaking his seals and revealing himself to be an Angel, he would still be defeated in a brawl by a trained martial arts master, or his brother. His power may be mildly superhuman, but power alone is not a substitute for skill or speed when 
facing a master. However, street thugs are seldom masters of the martial arts, and if he undoes his seals, or fights using obvious telekinesis (one of the few supernatural arts he has a genuine talent for), all bets are off.}

 neither of them is particularly shy about sex.}
