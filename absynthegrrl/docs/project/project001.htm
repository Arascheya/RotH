<p class="pagecaption">The Further Adventures of Ennui and Dementia</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Well, that's a pretty pretentious name if I do say so myself. It implies there was another story before this one and really there wasn't, at least not one that got written anyway. They say the naming of something is the first step though and I kind of like the sound of it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My friends have convinced me I should try and write down the stuff that has happened to me and so I am trying. Partly for myself and party to humor them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I guess I should start by saying a bit about myself, just so you know who I am. My name is Ennui, although I didn't start out with that name, but more on that in a bit. I am five foot five inches tall and one hundred and twenty pounds in the measurements of my place of birth. Right now I have black hair with purple and white streaks in it. Right now because I like to change my hair color often. Some say I'm pretty, but like most people I am not objective about how I look. I wish my tits were bigger and my ass a bit smaller. At least I'm not too thick around my stomach and I'm in good shape physically.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was born in the circus. No, really, you can look it up if you want. My birth certificate was signed in Seattle, but my mom's residence is listed as the circus train, or the city without a postal code as it is often described. The name she gave me was Anna-Elisa MArie Thomas. We lived with the circus until I was twelve and it was the most fantastic of times. There were a few of us that had parents in the show. We had our own teachers and while we learned the usual stuff growing up, like math and language, science and history we also learned circus arts. I was studying acrobatics and had just convinced Darlene to start me on high wire work. Looking back that may have been one of the reasons for my mom's decision to run away from the circus when I was twelve.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Maybe I should explain a bit about my mom to put it into perspective. She was a great mom in many ways. She loved me and took care of me. She watched out for me when I tried to do really stupid stuff. She was a wonderful person who had the worst luck with men that I have ever seen. Now in the circus the guys do have some pretty weird egos. You kind of have to be a performer. You need that arrogance that says, 'Yes, I can do that. I don't care what you say...' so there was a lot of that. My mom would find the ones where that was a veneer over insecurities, self loathing, and sometimes just plain nastiness. She never had a relationship that lasted more than a month or two for all the times I remember.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She had run away with the circus when she was at university. One day the circus came through town and she just snapped. She stayed after one of the afternoon shows and just kept hanging around. My dad hit on her and she jumped into his compartment and stayed. At first she didn't have many skills but she started helping with costuming. It didn't take long for her to become quite good at it. In three years she moved up to be head of the costume department for the train. Dad on the other hand wasn't so good at what he did and he jumped the train in one of the bigger cities before I was born.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Anyway, back to her jumping the train when I was twelve. Circus folk have always viewed the townies from a kind of us and them view point. It makes sense really. There they are tied to their places of residence and their jobs and all and here we are riding the rails and travelling about. They enjoy the shows we put on but they also view us as other because they don't understand how we can do what we do. Well I had found this book at one of the libraries where we had an arrangement. The circus could borrow books when we came through and return them the next time we came through. I had found this book about a woman who ran away with a gypsy. It was really kind of cool how she left one social system and learned to adapt to another. It was hard at first because suddenly she didn't fit with her lover's group but the non-gypsies started to view her with the same suspicion they showed to the rest of them. In the book was this great term, gaje, meaning non-gypsy. So a bunch of us adopted it for the townies. For some reason it really flipped my mom out. She suddenly started to think maybe I needed to be exposed to the townies to learn they weren't all that bad. Looking back on it I think the issues were much greater than that. She was getting tired of the costuming demands and I think she longed to settle down again. So it probably had nothing to do with our newly adopted term at all.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Anyway we were in this average mid-western town when she announced we were leaving the circus. I was devastated. In an instant my whole live disappeared and I went to join the ranks of the gaje. Now lest you think my mom a total flake I have to tell you that she had been corresponding with a guy she met several trips before in this town. This wasn't as ill-conceived as it sounds, although I hadn't been paying much attention to my mom's letters, so it came as quite a shock to me.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My step dad is a good person besides. We got along well and he really treated my mom extremely well. He had a younger daughter, my step sister Cindi (Always with an 'i', unless you wanted to piss her off), from a previous marriage and she was awesome. We got along from the first and remained close until I left. She is the one person I miss the most. I think about checking on her sometimes, just to make sure she is still ok.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Those were the good parts. The down parts were suddenly being thrust into a world of sedentary life. I started school and found the gaje were extremely hard on outsiders. Now the circus isn't always great about new-comers either, however we try to make them feel at home unless they are complete creeps. I was miserable for the first several years we were there. It wasn't until high school that I started to make any real friends and even then it was in the geeks and outcasts where I found the best ones. At last I really understood what the woman in my favorite book actually went through. It gave me greater appreciation for her and conversely her story helped me get through.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I hated the gaje world. It was all about obligations, mortgages, jobs, retirement benefits, and more obligations. My mom was thriving in the more stable and sedate life style she had found. I was dying inside. It felt like everything good and interesting in life was being denied by these people. To cope I wrote constantly to my friends in the circus. At first it was snail mail letters, then when the computer networks came along by electronic mail. We would send each other pictures and they would tell me about their latest performances. It kind of helped me survive.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It all led up to the worst fight my mom and I ever had. I was in my junior year of high school and had just gotten a letter from Terry, one of my best friends in the circus. She had just been in her first full performance and she had sent pictures and a review. My mom came in and wanted to talk about my grades again. I wasn't the best student and sometimes it was hard to keep plugging away at some of the subjects. The contrast between Terry's achievement and the gaje school just snapped something in my head and suddenly I found myself screaming, "Fucking gaje schools. All they care about is bullshit. Fucked up soul sucking bullshit. That and their god damned religion. Religion, the greatest force for evil the world has ever know."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How dare you! You don't know how lucky you are to be here. You keep that attitude up young lady and you will have no internet privileges or social privileges for the next month."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The thought of not being able to talk to my best friends poured ice through my anger. It took control of my voice and spoke through me in a cold and steady voice, "You take away my privileges and my grades will go down to 'F's and stay there."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You..you wouldn't. You'd be destroying your life." I had horrified her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Try me," I responded in that cold voice once more. I later apologized profusely for the outburst but the effect remained. It was the last time they tried to threaten me with removal of my coping mechanisms.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It did explain why so many gaje children really cut loose when they went off to university. After years and years of control and enforced order they were suddenly released into a place where they had to figure out their own way. They hadn't been shown that you can accomplish as much and still have fun along the way.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was this same junior year where I first started going by Ennui. I guess my class mates had noticed my spiraling decline. Soon they would point at me, put a hand to their head and say, "Oh, the ennui of it all." Which wasn't actually the way the word should be used. Then they started using it as a name to call me when I walked by. Rather than letting it get to me I rather found I liked it and took to it as a preferred name. I got my friends to start calling me by it all the time and it was soon in common enough usage that teachers who didn't have me in their classes actually thought it might be my name.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was even easier when I went off to university to make sure it was my common use name. University was like a breath of fresh air. There was diversity of thought, you could choose the classes you wanted, and no one was on your back to perform to any sort of standard. Other than the pressure of washing out of the system if your grades went too low it was up to you how much you did. My parents thought I should be a legal secretary or a nurse or something. They pushed as hard as they could for me to choose a career with a future. It didn't really work though. I enrolled in the theatre program and remained happily there. Even knowing it would be a constant fight whenever I return home didn't stop me. Although, to be fair, they were very happy that I had finally become a good student. I made the dean's list a couple of times even, so that backed some of the pressure off.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The theatre program was as close as I had been to performers and odd-balls in years. It was wonderful! You'd work your ass off, put on a great run of the show, and party like crazy when it was over. For a little while I didn't miss the circus quite so much. Plus the university was in a town where the circus train stopped every year. So for a glorious week each year I got to see old friends and catch up.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">University wasn't all fun and games, although at the time it seemed darker than it does in retrospect. I had tried relationships a few times. Being a relatively normal ex hormone bomb I went after the boys. Some were nice, some were not, but most just wanted to fuck and run. Truthfully that wasn't all bad because sometimes that's all I wanted as well. However there was one that I wanted to hang around. It didn't work though, I wasn't that comfortable with open relationships and he was doing the 'sleep around' thing. It hurt like hell when I found out.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Cindi was having a hard time of it too. She was quite a bit more alternative than I was. She's six years behind me so when I was off to college she was in middle school. Her last year there she told me she didn't like boys. It took a little bit to convince her she could talk to me but at last she told me she was gay. It didn't matter to me at all, but I knew da would flip. We agreed she'd send me e-mail whenever she needed to talk and we set up an encryption utility to keep it encoded in case someone else was trying to read her e-mails. She was able to find a few friends by the time she was in her first year of high school so that made her life better.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">So, ok, maybe my early life was more exciting than most, but it didn't feel that way to me. It was another late fall holiday break at university and i was whining to my friends about heading home. I wanted to see my family and all but I didn't want to sit through the routine lectures about how I should be thinking of what I was going to do after university. I was looking forward to talking to Cindi about her troubles in school and trying to forget my recent disappointment in love. So it was with a certain amount of trepidation and anticipation that I boarded the bus for home.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Memories overwhelmed me the instant I stepped off the bus at the down town depot. They were strong enough to make me start to regret the trip even before my parents could begin the onslaught. Just then I heard mama calling, "Anna, over here! Oh my god, what have you done to your hair?" 'Damn, I forgot, how the fuck could I have forgotten,' I thought at myself. I had been going to pull out the extensions and wash the color out before heading home. Normally I loved the head turns it prompted but then it was just one more target for the lectures. This particular instance had been really wild too. Wild orange and cherry red woven into hair I had dyed ultra-black. I had prepared it for the Day of the Dead celebrations and it had gone off gloriously.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mama, da, hi. Where's Cindy?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The school dance. Seems she has some of your habits, although she is more studious. I still can't believe you're wasting your time on theater instead of medicine."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't want to be a nurse. I don't cope well with sick people."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But there's no future in theater. Your mother figured that out when she left the circus."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Da, that's not true. The circus had to add a second unit to handle all the requests for shows and smaller circuses are starting up everywhere." I stared back into his angry look knowing where it came from. Immediately I tried to reassure him, "I am glad the two of you got together, and I love Cindy too. It's just I miss my friends. I miss the thrill of the show. Most of all I miss the travel. Can't you understand? Not everyone is meant to settle down."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Anna, I had my time being wild with the circus and I outgrew it. I don't want you to have to go through the same things I did."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mama, what did you go through? We had friends and I was learning things besides the boring stuff they crammed at me in the schools here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now don't you start. We tried to give you a good life..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And you did. You really did in a lot of ways. I just don't want to settle down. I see some of the others at university already giving away their options chasing security. I understand the desire, but the cost seems way too high!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now my dear, how many times have I tried to tell you that life isn't always about what you want."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know da, but can't it be once in a while?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now Anna, we've had these conversations every time you come home. Could we just leave it for now?" mama pleaded.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok mama, let's go home. I'd like to wash the trip off and get one of your good meals as well." It worked as a distraction for a few minutes anyway.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You know dear you should try and be more of a role model for your sister. She sees you going of to university and carrying on the way you do and it makes her think she should. She's started hanging with that black wearing crowd like you did. Do you really think it's good for her?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mama! Is she doing well in school? Does she have friends? You said she was off at the dance. Sounds like she's doing ok."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, yes, but I'm a bit worried. You had boy friends in school. Cindi doesn't. I'm worried about her. I don't want her socially stunted or anything."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mama, it'll be ok. I have friends at university who didn't start dating until then. She'll be fine."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I just don't want her to have a hard time is all."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She's going to be fine. She's a great kid."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I do wish you'd washed that stuff out of your hair before coming home though. I'll have to go to work on monday and listen to people talk."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's extensions da, it doesn't wash out."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now dear, I know you're finding yourself at school and all, but do you really think that's the way you want to go? Your father and I tried to raise you as a good christian girl and here you are painting yourself up and running with the devil crowd. I know we can't make you do things anymore, but could you try? At least for me?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Come on da, it's good for them. You can always tell them I chose the oldest profession instead of law. Some of them would appreciate it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Anna!" Sometimes it was really fun to scandalize my mom.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Anna, I wish you could take this more seriously. There'll come a time..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know da, there'll come a time when I look back on this and I'll cringe. At least it will mean I had some experiences. It's more than Bobby Alexander can say. He could have gone to school, instead he's working at the family business with no interest in anything beyond it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Anna..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Can we stop now? I don't want to argue with you, really. I love you guys. I really want you to know that."</p>
</br>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't care what you do when you're away at that school, but here you will look like a credit to this family and be a good example for your younger sister. If you want to stay here you'll look like the nice young girl i know you are. And wash that color out of your hair. It makes you look like a cheap whore."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm going to go unpack and take a shower." Quietly she slipped through the kitchen instead of toward her room. Using a well practiced series of steps she silently opened the door, darted across the back yard and across the neighbor's yard to the far street.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The night was warm but overcast, threatening rain at any moment as she followed a well known path to the cemetery. She slipped through the gap in the fence that never seemed to get repaired and headed for her favorite section, the overgrown, older area near the railroad. With a heavy sigh she settled down onto a worn headstone and stared moodily into the night. 'Damn them. Why couldn't we have stayed in LA? This place is so damn dull.' The answer of course came even as she railed against it. Her father needed work and he had work here. It wouldn't be so bad if he could just let her go clubbing but he had immediately adopted the narrow minded mind set of the town. He had expected her to do so as well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She tilted her head back and stared up at the darkening sky remembering that her mom had been no help either. She had returned to her mid-west roots even more quickly. She had re-joined the church she had complained about in LA and was welcomed back into the fold. Once there she had expected her daughter to dress conservatively and fall right into the congregation as yet another christian youth.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For six years she had managed to keep her head down, not get into too much trouble, and seethe with resentment about having no way to express herself. Going away to the university had been a great relief. She had met others with her interests, her grades had shot up and her parents were happy. It was only these periodic visits home that were tough.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Overhead lightning flashed as gusts of wind swirled the beginning fall leaves in the trees. With the wind came the scent of rain. For moments she thought of running for home, then decided going home was going to be bad enough that it wouldn't matter if she arrived sooner or later. Either way it would be ass chewing for going to that place again and reminding her of her sister.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Another flash of lightning and the skies opened up. Warm rain quickly turned cold as the clouds poured down onto the earth. within moments Ennui was soaked and beginning to wish she'd run for it. another flash of lightning revealed a train stopped on the railroad a few hundred yards away. she was sure it hadn't been there before the rain. the wind picked up turning the rain into horizontal freezing needles. in desperation she ran toward the train, hoping she could get into it's shelter at the least.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once she got close enough to see the train more clearly she almost stopped again. It looked more like a rail fan train, or something out of an episode of an old fantasy wild west television show. Still, it promised shelter from the wind lashed rain. she ran towards the back of the train and dodged around it. instantly the shelter reduced the rain and wind. as she huddled down the door to the back platform opened and a woman stepped out. she was dressed in a black silk long sleeve top with a ruffled front. it was open near her waist allowing a blue gem topped navel piercing to peek out. she had a short black lace skirt over a longer crimson velveteen skirt on that came mid way down the high lace up boots she was wearing. her hair was raven black and wavy. she looked directly down at Ennui and remarked conversationally, "Hell of a night for a wet shirt contest."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's raining out here in case you hadn't noticed."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, however most of us are inside when it happens."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe I was going to take a shower when you ruined my privacy."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Cheeky, I like that. I can toss you some soap or you could come in for a warm drink, the choice would be yours."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Let's see, shower or warm drink, I think the warm drink is winning out, but it is a hard choice..." Ennui stopped and tried to look like she was considering it but failed as her body drove her toward the stairs up. "Looks like warm drink wins." she reached for the stairs but stopped as the woman said, "What do you say?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The words formed unbidden in Ennui's mind, "I enter freely and of my own will."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Then enter and be welcome aboard the Death City Railroad, lady..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui," she replied as the woman raised her eyebrows. She expected the girl to hit the wards that stopped those that gave wrong names but the girl climbed up to the platform without incident.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome Ennui and Blessed Be." she motioned for Ennui to precede her into the coach. "Interesting name, is it really yours?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's the one I go by. I hate the one my parents gave me. In high school only my teachers used my given one. At university the given one only appears on official records."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Inside it was warm and dry. Oil lamps hung from wrought iron hangers on the walls. Large comfortable chairs in muted reds and blacks huddled together in comfortable clusters. an ornate golden samovar perched regally on a side table and fine china cups rested nearby, promising the warm drink that had been offered. A fire burned in a small wood stove providing heat against the chill air.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The woman took in the thin cotton top, blue jeans, and lank black hair with blue and silver streaks of her guest and continued, "I fear you are dripping on the carpets. Please, the bath is forward through the door, first compartment on the right. You'll find towels and dry things. you may draw a warm bath if you wish."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui looked down at the puddle that was forming on the rich oriental rug under her feet. "Uh, thanks, ms.?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, I'm sorry, Dementia, i am Dementia."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dementia, riiiight. And you asked about mine..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Look who's talking, Ennui." Dementia short back with a grin.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">ennui tip-toed to the door and down the hall to the bath area. an enormous claw footed tub filled most of the small chamber. rich burgundy towels hung from the rack and scented soaps filled a dish sitting on a small porcelain basin next to the water closet itself. hanging on a hook behind the door was a black silk dressing gown. drawing a bath she peeled off her wet things and slid into the water. slowly the cold cramps left her muscles and she slid deeper into the tub.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">after long minutes luxuriating in the water she climbed out, toweled off, slipped on the robe and returned to the sitting room. there she found dementia sprawled in a chair sipping tea and reading a sheaf of papers. She looked up as Ennui entered, "Better?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, thanks." Ennui crossed to the samovar and filled a cup of tea for herself. a delicate hint of jasmine scent rose from the steaming cup. she returned to a chair near Dementia and set down.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well now, it is time I asked you something. I am not here by accident. I'm not sure how to say any of this without creeping you out, so i guess i should just begin. I know you have dimly sensed there is more to the universe than what those around you have said. I know of your fascination with things dark and other worldly. Because of this I can offer you a chance to ride the Death City Metro. I can take you away from here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui choked on her tea. Once she finished coughing she laughed, "Never heard that one before. I think I'll get dressed again and leave now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wait, hear me out."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Right, and I'm just supposed to believe this too good to be true, offer not available in stores anywhere, kind of offer? I don't think so." Ennui rose and started toward the bath once more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You entered freely, you are free to go as well of course. Back to the school work and the failed relationships, back to the good christian parents, and back to the current boyfriend who is screwing everyone else behind your back. I can offer you so much more than that. All you need to do is come with me." Dementia saw Ennui wavering in spite of herself. "It's a dream you've always had, isn't it? The ability to step through the wall, turn the corner and be someplace new. Well I can give you that. And if you don't like it, you can return. Some disclaimers apply of course, but I'll explain them only if you sit and drink your tea. I have it on good authority that the rain will last at least another hour, maybe two."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui reluctantly returned to her seat. "Go on then."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The full offer is you can come and look around, you can participate, and you can leave whenever you want. The disclaimers are it can and will change you. The longer you are there or the more intensity of experience that you undertake the quicker you will change. In Death City we become how we see ourselves. So, while you can return at any time, those that you knew may not recognize you if you have changed too much. There is one last warning. You can die there, just like you can here. The difference is it is the Final Death, no coming around again, no reincarnation, no heaven, no hell, just total oblivion. So if you were looking forward to an afterlife or another turn on the wheel, this would not be the choice you'd want to take."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You aren't very good at the sales thing are you? You offered me this 'adventure' but you haven't said anything about what it is. Just all the things that could go wrong."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, right, ok... Death City exists to rescue the beauty created by life. The gods and such take care of the living things, the 'people', animals, and plants but they don't do anything with the beauty that the various peoples create. When war and destruction ravage a place it is Death City that recovers the art and science of these areas and the slowly and carefully filters it back into growing and thriving areas. Have you ever wondered a second hand shop and wondered where some of the truly unique things come from? That's where we have been."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui leaned back in her chair and sipped her tea. Outwardly she maintained as much calm as she could, however the rattling of the tea cup in it's saucer was a give-away for the turmoil in her head. "Can I think about it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"For as long as the train remains here, yes. Once you step back off the train, the offer is withdrawn. The Lady may see fit to offer again later, or she may not." Dementia watched the conflict for a few minutes before saying, "I know it's not an easy decision. Take your time. We can stay here as long as it takes. And now I'm going to read these documents and leave you to your thoughts. Interrupt if you have any questions."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What about the people I know?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It will be as if you walked out into the night and disappeared. That's the bad side. This isn't for everyone and none of us really have any idea how the Lady chooses." Dementia picked up the stack of papers and began reading once more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui sat and finished her tea, then got up and paced the room a while, then sat back down. She stared moodily out at the rain and then into her second cup of jasmine tea. She rose again and paced the room, glancing from time to time at the calmly reading figure in the chair, before throwing herself back into her own chair. Finally she sort of growled, "And if I say no?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Then we wait for the rain to stop, you get dressed in your own clothes again, and you leave. It really is that simple." Dementia replied calmly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui stood and headed for the corridor. "By all means, look around if you like. Not all of us travel in this much style though. Usually this is only for those of us that live aboard the rescue trains."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I was headed to the facilities, however I think I will." Once she had finished in the bathing area she headed farther down the corridor. The next compartment held a largish bed with intricate brass works forming the frame. Tall brass candle holders held column candles casting dancing shadows over the rich tapestries masking the walls. The next door back opened into a small kitchen with an attached dining area. The last compartment was a mixed pantry and storage area. At the end of the passage was the connection to the rest of the train. She thought of continuing forward but wasn't certain who else might be on the train. Slowly she retraced her steps as her mind continued to churn.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui emerged from the passageway and spoke, "OK, I'll give it a try. Show me what this is all about."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia pulled open the top drawer of the table next to her. She lifted a telephone style handset and spoke, "We can leave now. Let me know when we are nearing Escatcheban. We still need to pick up that extra item." She looked up at Ennui again, "We will be making a short detour on the way to Death City. I information they need to complete their mission. I suggest you make yourself comfortable. It will be a couple of hours."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There were a series of small jolts and thumps as the train slowly started to move. The train soon picked up speed and settled into a rhythm of motion. Ennui turned to peer out the window in time to see the train climb through the clouds and into the dark sky above. Panic flashed across Ennui's face as she back to the room. "What the hell is happening here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We are leaving. Don't worry you get used to it after a while. Some part of the magic of Death City Metro allows us to travel this way. Maybe someone who understands magic better could tell you how it really works."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They sat in silence for a while until Ennui said, "So, what do I do while I wait? Don't you at least have some music to listen to or something?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Try in the cabinet next to the samovar. There might be something you like in there." Ennui looked where Dementia was pointing, certain she didn't remember a cabinet there at all. Opening the doors she found a decent sound system and a stack of disks. She couldn't quite make out the titles until she thought of something she wanted to hear. Then the titles seemed to snap into focus. She gave a small gasp as she realized what was happening. "Oh yeah, things you need will seem to appear as you need them. It only really works for small things, like clothes and stuff, but it is kind of convenient," Dementia commented without looking up. "I forgot to mention that. Sorry." Ennui selected a couple of her favorites, hit play, and cranked up the volume. Mind shattering Goth beats thundered through the carriage. Dementia's head snapped up in shock.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui grinned at her response, "So, finally I got you to react. This is what I like and, as my da always said, guest's choice."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dementia listened for a while and nodded in approval. "That's good. I haven't found many who like what I like."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Where do you go clubbing in this Death City place? Seems you could always find a place that plays this."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There isn't a place, at least not that I know of."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui looked up in surprise. "That sucks. Maybe you should open one up then. I'd come anyway. Shit, I can't believe a place without a good club."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I could I suppose. Never really thought about it much I guess. What would you like?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What would I like? What kind of question is that? I haven't even said I'll stay yet. Hell, I haven't even seen the place yet."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, just give it some thought. I've never seen this thing of which you speak. I've heard this music from a couple of other wa...people but I have not seen this club of which you speak."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What sort of...not seen a club? I don't get it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Death City is outside of time in a way. Those who come there come from all kinds of times. I come from a place that is nowhere near what you come from. In my time there were Music Halls and theatres certainly. I have heard the term club used for a place of dancing, however it usually called a meet market as well and not seen as a particularly inviting thing."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Must have been some eighties guys. Yeah, eighties clubs kinda sucked from what I've heard. No, I meant' a goth club. People dress like you do and play music like this. Only people who are into the scene show up. Everyone is respectful and friendly. That's the kind of place it needs to be. Music Halls? I've seen that in a TV show or two. Wasn't that in London?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, in the nineties, ugh, the eighteen of my world. I once saw Sherlock Holmes come to the theatre where I was working. I think he was on a case."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sherlock Holmes, get out. That can't be right. He wasn't even real."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe not here he wasn't. Eternia touches many dimensions and many realities. He was very much alive in mine. Now tell me more about this club of yours. It sounds like it could be a good thing."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, well, it is usually a largish dark room with strobing and dancing lights, loud music, and a dance floor. The lights are kept low to encourage even the most embarrassed people to dance. Often there's a section with tables and a bar where you can get various drinks. The music is often played by DJs. Uh that would be people who play various pieces of music. Sometimes there are live bands. I don't know, that's about it I guess. Could be an old bar or an old warehouse or just about anything. The only requirements are enough room to dance and hopefully far enough from neighbors who would call the cops on the noise. There was a really cool one near where I was in school. The people who ran it lived above it in the apartments there and used the main floor for the club. I always thought they were really lucky."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You could do that you know. We could start one of these in Death City. There are plenty of places to find an empty building. We could have apartments above and make it any way we wanted."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Who's we white girl? Just visiting, remember."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. I just thought you might like to help me get it all sorted out. You know, make sure I do it right and all. But that's ok. I'm sure I can do it. You wouldn't want a hand in how it was set up or anything I'm guessing. What with just visiting and all."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui just snorted and went back to her chair. "Why don't you just go back to your papers and such. Unless you can tell me where to find something a bit more appropriate than this robe. Now that I'm staying for a while it would be nice to get dressed."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Check the storage area. There should be something in there you'd like to wear."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui hurried back to the storage area and emerged shortly dressed in a loose fitting top and faded blue jeans. She settled once more into her chair and glanced out the window. This time she stared out at the passing star-scape in wonder rather than terror. "Should I even ask how we are still alive?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Same thing as how we left in the first place. The magic creates a bubble around us. Inside it there is air and bits of track and everything else we need to move. It appears in front of us and disappears behind us. It is pretty wonderful really. Not much else I can say about it though. We are protected on the worlds where we are doing recovery work by the same types of magic as well." She lapsed back into silence for a long while, then stirred once more. "I guess I should tell you what to expect on Escatcheban. This world died from severe tidal forces generated in its core. The inhabitants were developing some new type of weapon based on gravity and didn't get it quite right. The devastation is pretty much complete. You can stay inside if you like. It won't be pretty. It never is. I need to tell the team how to find a particular vault. It appears one of the factions was stock-piling treasures in an unexpected location. Our original information didn't reveal it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And you just happen to have found it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, I have just happened to see it. It is my 'gift' I guess you would say."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But you wouldn't?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. I see the information in the context of what will happen to the team in question if they don't have the data. This time its several acid spraying devices."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ick."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Just as Ennui commented the phone chimed softly. Dementia picked it up, listened for a moment, then put it back down again. "Now you can see what it looks like going the other way. We are arriving soon."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui watched from the window as slowly the train entered the fringes of the atmosphere and silently sailed downward. Even with magic the ionization layer build-up was impressive as they shed speed to drop to the surface. Once the burning flare passed by they could see dark roiling clouds far below. As they passed through greasy rail streaked the windows and pounded on the roof. Ennui looked back at Dementia and rolled her eyes. "More rain?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"'Fraid so. We won't be long though." As they dropped below the clouds a nightmare landscape came into view. Shattered buildings littered the ground. Flares of burning gases lit the scene in red and yellow flickers. Steel skeletons reached broken fingers toward the sky. The train shook and shuddered whenever it touched real world track as the earth convulsed in pain.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Around a curve Ennui could see another train pulled off on a siding. Powerful spot lights beamed from the roofs of several cars. In the glare groups of figures huddled against the wind and pulled various items from the rubble around them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As the train slowed to a stop on the main line near the stopped one Dementia stood, ventured back into the passage, then returned a few minutes later in a long woolen cloak. Pulling the hood up she stepped through the back door and out into the wind. It gusted briefly around the warm interior bringing with it the smell of fire, smoke, and burnt things.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui watched as Dementia struggled over to the nearest group of figures and began gesturing and motioning toward a shattered pile of building. It was clear she was issuing detailed information about it. Once she violently shook her head and gestured firmly. After about ten minutes she turned and struggled back to the train. Once again the door let in the howling wind and terrible smells of the dead world. She slumped against the door for long moments, breathing hard. "Gods, I hate this part. So much death and misery. You can feel it in the air, hear the screams on the wind, smell the blood..." Sobs wracked her as she slid to the floor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui rose and slowly approached. Carefully she pulled Dementia into a close hug. "Shhh, it's ok. It's ok. We can leave now. Let the others handle it." Ennui helped Dementia back to her chair and settled her into it. She pulled the phone out and stared at it for a moment before speaking, "Hello? This is Ennui. I'm back here with Dementia. She did what she came for. Can we please leave now?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A soft genderless voice replied, "Certainly." She replaced the receiver as once again the train gathered speed and soared off into the sky.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you," Dementia murmured quietly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, no problem. Can't leave my club partner to suffer alone now can I?" Ennui replied with a forced grin. "You going to be ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, it's only really bad when I'm out in it. It's not just visions for Death City personnel that I get. I can see it all. The wars, the deaths, the terror..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui pulled her close again, "Shh, stop now. Don't think about it. We are leaving. Don't make it worse than it has to be. Tell me about Death City."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Death City is the center of Eternia. It's not the only city, it's just the one where i park this carriage when I'm not out on a mission. There's a larger, more industrial city between Death City and Portal Station. Portal Station is the main entry to Eternia. It is the Gate between the Realms, where we are now, and the 'otherness' of where Death City is. It is beautiful there. It's a place of healing, peace, and rest. I'm tired, would you mind terribly if I were to take a short nap? It's another hour at least to Portal Station and suddenly I can't keep my eyes open."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, I wouldn't mind. Let me help you." Ennui supported Dementia as they walked to her room. Once she was comfortable in the bed Ennui went back to the sitting room, got yet another cup of tea, and settled into Dementia's chair.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Curious, she picked up the papers Dementia had been reading. They had 'Escatcheban' printed in a title block and were plans and diagrams. She was about to place the stack back on the table when her eyes were drawn to the last few. These pages were hand written in a neat block print. On them was detailed the fall of Escatcheban. On the very last page the ink had smeared a bit, as if it had gotten wet. Under the last paragraph was a simple tag line saying, 'Recorded by Dementia - DCM'." Slowly she straightened the stack of papers and set them back on the table. She leaned back and sipped the tea. "What have I stepped into?' she wondered. She finished the tea and leaned her head back. Soon she was half dozing, staring at the ornate curved ceiling of the carriage. At last she drifted into a fitful sleep.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The soft buzzing of the intercom phone pulled her awake. Still in a sleepy daze she growled, "What?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Portal Station in ten minutes."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Portal Station? What's that...uh...oh...right...sorry. Didn't mean to be rude."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok. This is Ennui, right? How is Lady Dementia? Better I hope!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She's asleep. I think she is doing better. Should I wake her?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You might make sure you're nearby in case the transition wakes her. It's quite intense. Just so you know it is almost pain, almost pleasure, almost terror, and almost nirvana. It is quite a sensation. You can let her go back to sleep if she wakes up. It's another two hours from Portal Station to Death City and if I know her she probably really needs the rest. We don't need to stop and dispatch will have us cleared through."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, and thanks." She swiftly walked to the bed chamber and sat on the floor next to the bed. She positioned herself so she would be in plain view if Dementia woke, then waited with growing trepidation for the Portal.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She knew the instant they passed it. Every cell in her body screamed in unimaginable raw sensation. The air shimmered and danced, while everything solid pulsed between thin fog and thick veils. For a moment she glimpsed  something indescribable behind it all. Then as quickly as it had come it was gone. She glanced fearfully at the bed but saw Dementia was still asleep, although a small smile had appeared on her lips.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She looked through the window in time to see the last lights of a building as the train thundered into a long tunnel. Dementia stirred at the rising tide of sound as the tunnel echoed the train noises back on top of each other. "Ah, home! Welcome to Eternia."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks. The engineer told me you can sleep some more. Don't wake up for me, I'm fine."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I probably will once we are out of this tunnel. This is the longest and loudest on the route. You should see this during the day. Once we clear the tunnel it is spectacular!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure I will."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui leaned back against the bed before sliding down to the floor. Sleep stole over her as well as the night's activities caught up with her.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui woke to Dementia softly calling her name. "Hey, you want to share the bed? It's more comfortable than the floor and it has plenty of room." Dementia patted the side next to her. "Come on. It's late and there will be time enough in the morning to show you around." Ennui started to shake her head. "I don't bite and we're both dressed if that's what worried you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui blushed bright red. "No, no, that's not a problem. Although my sister is the one who likes girls, although she hasn't told anyone but me yet, and I'm babbling," she paused, "I just don't want to invade..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You aren't invading. I seduced you," Dementia grinned wickedly before finishing the thought, "into coming on this adventure. If you were invading I wouldn't offer. Now come on. We both need the rest." She patted the bed once more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Reluctantly Ennui slid in beside her and more swiftly than she thought fell back asleep.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Bright morning sunshine woke Ennui. Next to her Dementia still slept. Moving slowly and carefully Ennui eased out of the bed and slipped down the hall to the bath. From there she went to the kitchen and took a quick look around. Seeing coffee and a maker she started it all going. As the aroma of fresh coffee filled the carriage she heard movement from the bed room.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, morning, you didn't have to..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know, I wanted some anyway." Ennui filled a cup of coffee and handed it to Dementia. She filled another for herself and sat down at the small table. They sipped in silence for a while before Ennui asked, "So, now that I'm here, what do I do?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now I show you around a bit and we find you a place to stay until you decide what you want. If you're hungry we can eat here or there's a place nearby that serves great breakfasts. Choice is yours."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How about out then? I don't want to be a bother."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, let me get ready and we can go."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later they stepped out the back of the coach and descended to the ground. Around them was a moderate sized train yard. "Welcome to Temple Heath Maintenance Yards. Temple Heath fixes all the locomotives in the Death City fleet. The large sheds are the repair works and the rest of this is various storage and support facilities. I think about 50 people work here now. Around the yards are the homes of many who work here and the various shops and other facilities to support the work here. Further back toward Portal Station is the carriage works, where they maintain the rolling stock." Dementia pointed toward the river. "Across the river is the Temple of All Faiths, Central Station, and the Adam and Eve. There are homes and shops, restaurants and pubs over there as well. We are headed toward the Adam and Eve. Big Jo sets an excellent table."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why is your coach parked here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Central Station has very little track space but I still like to be near the center of town. Bart and I came to an understanding after I found him a few choice rescues that helped him repair some of the locos under his care." Dementia lead the way to the great rail bridge that brought the rails to Central Station. She lead the way onto the pedestrian walkway across the slowly flowing river. Just before the ornate glass and iron structures covering the station platforms she turned left and guided Ennui down a set of worn stone steps to the river path. She turned left and followed the path around to a gate set in a high wall. "This is the cathedral close, the cathedral lands. The Adam and Eve is on cathedral lands." Dementia opened the gate and continued along the path until she came to the branch that arced up to the pub.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The pub door opened into a small common room. To the left stairs went down to another section. Directly across was the modest bar with a cheerful young woman arranging glasses behind it. Only one small table near the center of the room. Everywhere else contented patrons were digging into large plates of food. The aromas drifting through the room immediately reminded Ennui she hadn't eaten since the previous afternoon. "I forgot my ID back at the train."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Reality check, you aren't in the Realms any more. Here you are assumed competent until you prove otherwise. Also, everything here is a loose form of barter. The pub provides food for you, you provide services in some manner for others. It's as close to communal living as I've ever seen and it works remarkably well here." Dementia waved toward the counter, "Hi Jo. What's the special of the morning?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hi stranger! Shepherds pie, although the four mushroom omelet is a good second bet. Coffee first?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Of course!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Coffee would be great. And could i get grapefruit juice as well?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think we have some, I'll bring it if we do." Jo disappeared into the kitchen only to return a few moments later with two huge mugs of coffee and a pint glass of grapefruit juice. "Know what you'd like yet?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shepherds pie," answered Dementia. "Jo, meet Ennui. Ennui is visiting us for a little while. She hasn't decided yet if she plans to stay or not."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Pleased to meet you!" Jo exclaimed as she gave a small bow to Ennui.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Pleased to meet you as well. I would like the omelet please," Ennui added.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Great, they'll be up soon."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's Jo, Big Joe's daughter. Short for Josephine. His wife's name is Marta, although she mostly does the cooking so she's mostly in the kitchen."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How did they get here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's one of the social rules here, I'm afraid. You can tell someone how you arrived if you want but it is considered extremely impolite to ask someone else how they did."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, then I won't ask you about yourself then."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok, I will tell you if you are interested, however not until after we are done here. It's best shared in a bit more privacy. I can try and answer questions you might have though."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, for starters, there is the obvious why me one..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad I said try. That is one none of us knows. The Lady makes the choices. She hasn't yet revealed how. What we do know is you have a skills that will fit in well here. You also most likely will adapt well to our loose communal society."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And if I stay but don't adapt?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It has happened. however what usually happens is the person who can't adapt moves on in some way. Either they take a Sacred Unit to the more traditional afterlife or they end up dying on a mission. You don't seem like someone that will end up on that path though. Ah, and here is our food." For the next few minutes they dug into the delicious fare that made the Adam and Eve the place to go for food.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once they had finished Dementia lead the way back out into the cathedral close. "How about I just take you around the streets for a bit? Give you a general sense of the place."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds good. I must say I was expecting something a bit more Victorian London though with a name like Death City."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There are places like that. There is a major industrial city a few kilometers back toward Portal Station that would fit that description better. Here we are even older in feel actually."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They walked through winding cobbled streets and alleyways. They passed shops and houses and other pubs. Finally Ennui turned to Dementia and said, "There was something you started to tell me at the pub. About how you came to be here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ah yes. There is something I need to tell you first though. This place is called Death City because most of us die to get here. You did not. You are what is known here as a Shadow Walker. You could return to the Realms and your old life just by stepping off a train in the Realms. There are some here who are not kind to Walkers. It has to do with a weird mix of envy and pity. They pity you because they feel you aren't complete and they envy you because you can return to stay. It's best not to let people know this about yourself."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But you told Jo..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I told Jo you hadn't decided if you were staying. Every new arrival in Death City has a choice. Usually it is the choice between journeying to the afterlife or remaining in Death City. For Walkers it is deciding whether to return to the Realms or remain. Jo will assume you are just another new arrival. Even the dead can die here. Once again it is the final death. This becomes the last afterlife you would get."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh wow. So you are dead then?" Ennui backed away a pace and stared at her companion.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"My Realms body died and I came here. I guess it counts as death and this is the afterlife. Some of the religious would say you have seen heaven, although they would be technically wrong."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't get it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Heaven is a place, so is Hell, and Valhalla, and the Summerland, and a host of other afterlife places. Death City is Death City. We are not a part of that either. We are our own place. What I have managed to piece together during my time here is that the Lady predates many of the other deities. She was not interested in playing the worshipper proxy wars that so many of the others like. As a result she created this place. A neutral place where beauty could be preserved. A place where those of us that didn't want to sell our thoughts to a younger, petty minded god could come and be. Her feeling was let the gods fight over the other souls. Here we would preserve beauty and we would provide healing for those who had tired of the proxy fights the other gods demanded. Our charter then is to go out into the Realms and rescue the beauty that no other deities really care about. There is danger from the others. Some see us as evil minions to be destroyed. Others see us as offshoots of the powers of good. While out in the Realms we need to maintain scrupulous neutrality, otherwise the gods and such may decide to attack us as well as each other."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I still can't believe you are dead."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's complicated. You can touch me. Obviously you did when you helped me in the train. My body died and my soul transitioned. Now you know. There is an afterlife and everyone gets some version of it. Even those that choose oblivion can have that as well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wow. I could really freak my parents if I went back."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Typically they wouldn't believe you. Trust me, other Walkers have tried it. The results are uniformly bad. Now they just send you to a therapist. Some Walkers were confined to institutions in the earlier days. We got them out of course. Still it is a pain in the butt to get into some of those places."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So how did you, you know, die?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It was kind of stupid really. I was working at this theatre in London. It was in a rough section, the border between Whitechapel and a more genteel section of the city. Anyway I saw someone go down into the cellars of the theatre one night after the show. Rather than telling Mr. Jago, the owner, about it I went to investigate. I thought I was being clever and I guess I sort of was, I just wasn't being very careful. I crept up to where this person was and saw that he had an open trap in the cellar floor. Out of it was climbing a very old chinaman. I dodged back into the shadows but I thought for one moment his emerald green eyes had locked with mine. I had convinced myself that I had gotten away with it and left for my home. I hadn't gotten away with it at all. Someone followed me to my flat above the Fox and Hounds pub and once I was safely in my room they slit my throat and left. I awoke on satin sheets aboard a Death City train. Marta, Big Joe's wife explained to me what had happened and where I was as we left my London behind. The rest is history."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How long ago was that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I have no idea now. Time passes here but we don't really pay much attention. You live until you choose to no longer do so here. Or until misfortune finds you on a rescue mission."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui remained silent as they walked through the center of town and approached the massive structure of Central Station. At last she asked, "You said something about changing. What did you mean by that? I haven't had much luck changing myself in the Realms."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Here you become how you see yourself. It's one of those things that's really hard to put into words. Inside each of us is a sense of self. A sense of how we think we look and how we act or react to life. I vaguely remember when I was in the Realms that I would see my reflection in a mirror and it wouldn't quite match how I saw myself in my head. Here you will slowly change to match that inner view."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Gods, I am so fucked."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not necessarily. It isn't the conscious nasty little voice view. It's something deeper than that. It will happen to you as well. Although as a Walker the changes will be much slower. Since you arrived with a physical form already existing. It is one of the greatest gifts of Death City and the Lady."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This Lady, is there anything more you can say about her?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. I have heard many names for her. Lady, Mother, Kali..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Kali!?! The Destroyer?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And the loving mother. Never forget, Kali is both. I can see you have much to think about. Maybe we should think about finding you a place to stay?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe we should look for a suitable club building instead. If we were to find that we would also find me a place to stay. At least we would if this works the way you said it did."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"If you really need this then it should work that way. Do you really need this?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes I do. I think you do as well. What do you do right now when you aren't out having your brain hammered by visions? Do you just stay in that rail car of yours?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I wander the streets. Sometimes I help out in the Hall of Records, cataloging and adding to the records of the worlds we have recovered items from. Once in a while I will go along when a shipment of items is taken to a thriving Realms world."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds very selfless of you. Now what do you do for yourself? What makes you happy?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, well, I listen to music and I wander around talking to people in the city. I like to talk to people. It's just hard to connect with them sometimes. It's a matter of finding someone with similar interests to connect with."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"See? If we had a club people of some similar interests anyway would come to it. It would save having to hunt for them. Here's what I think we should do. We should return to your coach and decide what this club should have. Once we have an idea we should start looking for a place we can turn into it." Ennui looked around and continued, "I think I'm lost. How do we get back to your train?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This way," Dementia replied as she turned and started off down a side street. "I have no idea what should go into a club. I'm guessing we should have a bar of some type, a kitchen, sounds like a dancing area, and some type of sound system. You're the expert. I've never even been to one of these things."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think it's time for a field trip. How do you get an engine/locomotive/whatever you officially call the thing that pulls the train? I need to take you to a club or two. I know several great ones where I came from."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's not that easy..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean? You mean we are prisoners here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, no, you can leave whenever you want, well as soon as we could get a train. It's just most of us aren't encouraged to wander into the Realms. There's too much chance of something going very wrong."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Alright - who's in charge. It's time I told them a thing or two..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wait. It's not that. It's that it would be too easy to upset the balance of things."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We are just going clubbing. That won't hurt. Look, if I really am wanted here then I have some type of reason right? Maybe this is it. Now how do we do this?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia lead the way into the coach. "I'll call dispatch. They typically assign travel schedules. Once that's done Bart controls which locomotives are available. Once something is scheduled he will release one with a driver and then we go when the routing is cleared." She reached for the com set in the drawer and punched a couple of buttons. "Dispatch, this is Dementia. I need to schedule a trip back to Ennui's world...no, the first one I went to last night...that's right...no, not the same place, no...just a minute, maybe Ennui can explain it better." She handed the handset to Ennui saying, "Merris is the head of dispatch. You need to tell her where we have to go."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Merris, hello. I'm Ennui...that's right...the city is called Madison and it's in a state called Wisconsin...you do? Wicked!...no, I'm from Indiana. I was going to school in Madison. I never made it to that part of the state...yeah, the east side, kind of...no, I don't remember the address. It's called Inferno and it's right near an active railroad...you can? How wicked is that!...I'll let her know. Thanks." Ennui handed the handset back to Dementia and said, "The route's cleared for tonight. All we need is a locomotive. We should arrive about the time the club opens. Now I need to find something suitable. Where in this town can I go shopping?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You can check the storage area again and if you don't find what you need there are some shops back in town." Ennui bounded out of the room and dashed to the storage section. Clothes rapidly piled up in the passage as she pawed through it. Finally she found what she wanted and tossed the items on the bed before carefully returning the rest of the clothes to storage. In the bed room she dressed in her finding. Spider web stockings under a skirt cut mid thigh in the front and almost floor length in back. A tight crimson silk top with short sleeves under a spider web lace long sleeve bodice. Button up granny boots completed the ensemble.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia was just entering the coach as Ennui returned to the sitting room. "Bart will have a locomotive for us in time for departure. I wasn't sure how long we would be there so I told him we'd be back by morning."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The club closes by two in the morning so we will be fine. You know, this is really weird. I feel like I should be somewhere or doing something. If I were home I'd either be hanging with friends or doing homework in preparation for monday classes."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You get used to it after a while. Once you've been here a day or two you can start hunting things to do. Temple Heath here is a pretty good example. It combines the better parts of a full time job with a lot more slack and ability to set your own time schedule. About the only place that doesn't work is running a pub or shop. People seem to expect regular sets of hours."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What do you do?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm between positions at the moment."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That sounds like you got fired. Can that happen?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. Actually I took a few days in case you wanted someone to hang with while you got settled. Or until you decided to return. Normally I help at the Hall of Records. Some of us think it's important to keep track of the worlds we visit and the circumstances that lead to their destruction. There are a couple of Walkers who distribute some of this as ideas or stories in several of the Realms. Just recently we've gotten a group of historians as recent arrivals. They have improved on the process quite a bit."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So you could be between projects..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Look, I'm interested in this project, but if you keep beating me with it I'm going to get pissed off." Dementia growled through a grin.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, ok, I'll stop. Maybe we should get something to eat before we go. It will be a long night."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">They returned to the train from the Adam and Eve just as Bart was coupling the locomotive to the car. Bart was an impressive man. He must have topped six foot two easily and was wide shouldered and barrel chested. Muscles rippled and bulged as he made the final connections between the locomotive and car. He smiled as he stood towering over the two of them. "All set then ladies. Allen is in the cab and awaits your instructions. Dementia, I want you to stay out of trouble." Dementia turned and stuck her tongue out at him. He turned to Ennui, "See, you just don't get any respect around here. You must be Ennui," he said as he thrust a huge hand in her direction. "I'm Bart. Dementia mentioned you'd talked her into this little joy ride. Are you going to be trouble as well?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui flashed an innocent smile as she took his hand, "Who, me? Of course not." She expected a handshake, instead he briefly touched his lips to the back of her hand.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well I won't keep you. Have a good trip." Bart turned and headed back toward the nearest shed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A young handsome blonde head appeared at the window of the locomotive cab. "Ladies, if you could get aboard. Merris has given us a pretty narrow window on the main lines."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Certainly!" They scrambled aboard as the whistle sounded and the train moved off down the track. Dementia pointed at the windows as they seated themselves. "You should watch this time. There is some incredible scenery on this trip." They rolled out of Death City, through a section of farm land and then through an industrialized valley. Climbing back out of the valley they passed through more farm land, then into the industrial district of a large Victorian city. Factories, mills, and brick works stood along the lines and canals and wagon ways wove a tight web tying the rest of the city to the tracks. Ahead, on a hill rising higher than the chimneys and warehouses, were buildings of white stone, surrounded by spaces of green. Suddenly they were running straight into a gradually deepening cutting. The twin tracks they were on branched to the right and ran through a valley of rock walls, swinging away from the city center and arrowing toward the distant mountains.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly they climbed through foot hills and then into the mountains. Soon the tracks were running through towering trees that slowly gave way to rock strewn slopes. Here the track clung to the sides of the steepening mountains. Twisting and turning the train clawed its way up winding through narrow valleys and soaring over high bridges. Suddenly they rounded another bend and soared out on an impossible long bridge and then into a long thundering tunnel. "We're almost to the Portal aren't we? I remember this sound from last night." Ennui shouted over the thundering echoes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. We come out of the tunnel, pass Portal station, and then go through the Portal." As Dementia shouted back. As she finished they cleared the tunnel and stormed past the station. Then came the ripping and shifting of the Portal, followed by the silence of the void. "This should take about forty-five minutes tonight. We don't have to stop anywhere else."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This thing needs a television or something. What do you do to pass the time?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Read. You do know how to do that, right?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh very funny. Yes, I know how to read. So where's the library?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There are those leather bound things in the case near the passageway. You might try them." Ennui moved forward and began searching the titles, finally deciding on an H.P. Lovecraft volume. She settled back into a chair and dove in. The rest of the journey through the void passed in silence.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At last the com chimed. Dementia picked it up, spoke briefly, then replaced it. "We're headed down. Inferno in just over under half an hour."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Half an hour later the train slowed, stopped and reversed briefly. Once more the com chimed. Dementia listened and nodded, then hung up. "We are here. Lead on."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui headed out the door of the coach and onto the back platform. She was about to descend when she head shouting, "Demon worshippers. Heathens. You go to spiritual death in there." She stopped so abruptly that Dementia crashed into her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now what? They'll see us in a minute."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Relax. Magic shields the train from them. They won't notice it unless they trip over it. This makes it harder to get to the club though. What's up with this?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. This is the first time I've seen this happen. Some church must have gotten a bug up its ass again. Will the train's magic hide us if we stay close to it? Maybe we could slip up to the front and make it look like we followed the tracks down from our neighborhood."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It should, as long as we are within three or four feet of it." Dementia led the way until they were out of easy view of the crowd. They turned and followed the main line back toward the club.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As they crossed into the street light a woman turned and pointed straight at Dementia, "Devil spawn. It is her, the great demon we were warned of."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia froze as she stared at the woman. Small incoherent sounds bubbled out of her throat. "Come on, don't let her rattle you. We'll be safe inside," Ennui urged as she grabbed for Dementia's hand. Her vision swam for a split instant as their hands touched and then she saw what Dementia saw. In place of the middle aged house wife looking woman was a writhing twisting ball of tentacles and eyes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Gibbering mouths foamed and frothed as the woman's voice howled on, "Stop her. Save our children." The thing rushed at them as Dementia's feet finally moved.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui dragged her across the small parking area and up the ramp to the front door. Incantations rushed through her mouth as she hauled the door open and shoved Dementia through into the pulsing music of the club. Turning she yanked the door closed and traced intricate patterns rapidly over it. A shimmer of blue light flickered across the door and into it as a terrible pounding started from outside.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui? What the hell was that?" asked a goth boy dressed in classic vampire apparel.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui ignored him as her hands continued in more relaxed but even more intricate motions. After several seconds she brought her hands together then slowly opened and spread them as she turned a slow circle. Blue energies flickered and flowed along the walls and ceiling as she slumped into the counter. Her eyes slowly focused on him as she asked, "Mortiss? Did you ask me something?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He stared at her strangely for a moment, then shook his head. "I thought you ..." He stopped as the door opened and three girls hurried in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Heya Mortiss. It's really creepy out there. Some christian nut balls are at it again."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Morticia, Sarthana, Melicious. Should I call the cops? They've been there since before opening, about an hour and a half ago."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Naw, it looks like they're staying back from the door. They certainly are vocal tonight though. Weird for Madison. I wonder what's got them riled tonight." Mortiss and the three missed the shared look between Dementia and Ennui. "Hey Ennui, who's your friend? Don't think I've seen her before. Weren't you headed home for the weekend?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Morticia, Sarthana, Melicious, and Mortiss this is Dementia. She's a friend of mine from out of town. I was going to go home until I realized this was the weekend Dementia was going to be here. Gotta go home for the upcoming holiday anyway. Wouldn't want the pleasure too often."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I know that feeling. Just be glad your folks live in Indiana. It sure beats having them in town, except when it's time for laundry that is," Morticia sympathized. She and the others passed money to Mortiss and moved around the counter into the club.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dementia, could I see some ID please?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A panicked look crossed her face, "I'm afraid I don't have it with me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mortiss, is there any way we can work this? She left it back at my place and I'd really hate to have to go back for it. Although we can if we have to."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mortiss paused for a moment then replied, "It'll be ok tonight. Go on in. And Ennui..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah Mortiss?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Some day I want you to explain what you did when you ran through the door. That was really odd."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, sure Mortiss. Catch me monday after physics, ok? And I owe you a dance when you're off the door."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She grinned as she paid the cover and led the way into the dark club. "Welcome to my world now." She sauntered across the end of the dance floor and up to the bar where she leaned across. "Hey Darien, bulls blood for me and..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"White wine."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"..for Dementia. Dementia, this is Darien, one of the coolest bartenders in the known universe." He smiled deeply and mock bowed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you Ms. Ennui. Doesn't get you anything off your drinks though."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, one of these days it's gotta work." She paid for the offered drinks and walked to an empty table near the dance floor. Once they were seated she leaned toward Dementia and asked sharply, "What the Fuck was that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A glaazraak demon I think." Dementia replied slowly, "Although why it is here I have no idea. They don't usually come to living worlds." Dementia stared back at Ennui. "And what the fuck was what you did to the door and room?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I have no idea. It popped into my head and I did it. I just knew I couldn't let that thing in here. What does a glaazraak do anyway?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sows discord, fuels hate, and feeds on fear. That is if I remember correctly. We aren't supposed to have to go up against them. It sure looked like that one was about to ignore the truce."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ya think?" A brilliant, incandescent crimson spot blossomed on the glass block window next to them. Swiftly it faded into mauve, then purple, then back to blue webbing as Ennui clutched her head and stifled a scream. "Holy fuck! Oww, oww, shit!" Her head drooped forward as she took several very deep breaths. When her head came back up violet fire had replaced her eyes. Her hands circled and twined as though engaged in an invisible game of cat's cradle, then she pushed them out and toward the wall. Blue fire shot out and flowed along a spider web of lines painting thick blue tendrils everywhere. For a moment the sound system faded and the lights dimmed. All over the club people looked up startled. Only Mortiss and Darien noticed Ennui's motions however. "Fucking thing. Let it suck on that!" she hissed. She took a couple more deep breaths and leaned back. "Now, this is what a club is like. Well, except for the weird magic shit. People know you at your club. There's fancier places. I remember one that was split level, dance floor on one and bar/food service on another. Then there's all the ones you see in movies that aren't real. Anyway, the sky's the limit on what we could do. I think we should..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Her voice trailed off as she saw Dementia grab her head. "No, not now..." She shuddered and drew ragged breaths. "Ennui, gotta get..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey Ennui, Dementia. I'm off the door and have come to collect..." Mortiss' voice broke in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly another incandescent white hot spot appeared in the window. Blue web lines flared into life as the sound system and lights failed. Rapidly the white faded away. Dementia looked at Ennui expecting her to shriek again. Instead she was sitting looking extremely pleased with herself. Her satisfaction disappeared as two white spots hit the window and rapidly grew larger. A shuddering crash echoed through the room as a car punched through the wall and slammed into Mortiss. The impact threw him back into one of the support posts where the car briefly pinned him until the post gave way. Screams erupted throughout the room as parts of the ceiling dropped away. The building shuddered and groaned but held.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Immediately Ennui was on her feet. Her shout cut through the noise and quieted the worst of it. "Ok everyone. Leave through the nearest emergency exit. Darien, call 911."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Darien appeared near her side. "I'd love to, however I can't quite seem to pick up the phone."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What?" Ennui started to say.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui, what happened?" Her voice died when she heard Mortiss and saw him stand up even as he was still laying on the floor. "Ennui, what's happening?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dementia?" Ennui croaked out.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Later Ennui. Get the rest out. Your two friends and I will wait for you outside the wall over here. Mortiss, please join Darien and I. I'll try and explain things."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The sound of shattering glass pulled Ennui's attention away from her friends. The glaazraak had shattered the back window of the car and was crawling out. "Now you die creature of Eternia." A reddish yellow ball of energy flew from it and smashed into Ennui. It threw her back into the shattered wall. Blood ran down her back from a chunk of the glass block that had been the window. Feeding her energy on the pain she shot violet energy back at the creature. It howled in agony as the energy pushed it back into the wrecked automobile.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once again it readied an energy ball as Ennui tapped into the last of the building's electrical system. Violet white light streamed from her hands and etched away the creature pinned to the shattered car. With its last strength it hurled one last ball of fire at Ennui. It touched her side and fire blossomed at its touch. She twitched and shook as the pain fought along her screaming nerves. Forcing her hands to remain steady she continued to burn away parts of her foe. Its screams mingled with hers and then slowly faded as it smoked and burned away. At last silence fell once more as Ennui collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her body was still twitching and convulsing when Dementia poked her head back in to see where she was. Dropping to Ennui's side she pulled her into a careful hug. Only then did she notice the blood oozing from Ennui's back. She ripped off her over skirt and wrapped it tightly about her friend. Carefully she helped her stand and stagger back to the train. "Come on guys. You have to come with me if you want to know what happened. Remember the words I said to you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia helped Ennui onto the train and waited as the two following her spoke the ritual of entry. Once aboard the train she called Allen and told him to make all haste for home. Then she took Ennui to the bed room and patched up her back as well as she could. "Sorry, that's as good as I can do until we get back."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks. It feels better already. I'd like to hear what you are going to tell the guys. Do you think you could tell them in here where I am?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure. You just take it easy though."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes mom."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, can't have my club partner leaving after just one day in Eternia now can I?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As Dementia turned and headed for the sitting room a tall woman in a flowing dark dress walked in behind her. Every time Ennui thought she could say what she looked like the image flickered out of her mind again. The woman slowly approached the bed and smiled. "Greetings child. I felt I should come and see you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">""Who are you? Oh god, you're her..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Goddess really, but it doesn't matter. I am here to heal you in thanks for the restraint and presence of mind you exhibited back there. You sought to defend always. Resorting to destruction only as a last choice. Many would have not been able to do that." She reached out and softly touched Ennui's back. Instantly the pain fled and a warm tingly sensation spread out from the wound. "It will be fine in a few minutes. There is something else I want you to do. I want you to believe with all your heart that none of this is your fault. For truly, none of it is. What happened has been building for millennia. You and the others were just in the wrong place. Now come, I wish to speak with your friends before I go." She motioned for Ennui to precede her down the passage.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What are you doing..." Dementia started to say until she saw the woman following Ennui. She dropped to her knees with her head bowed, "Goddess, forgive me. It was my fault. I never should have let her..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hush Dementia, and get up and sit down. You know I neither want nor require abasement. This is not your fault, nor is it Ennui's. You had the misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when a random act of the universe occurred. This situation has been building for millennia on countless different worlds. If it hadn't been triggered here, it would have happened elsewhere." She looked around the room and continued, "Now, I would like each of you to describe in exact detail what you saw this evening. Then I will explain to the two gentlemen what has happened to them and what they may choose next. Perhaps you should start." She said to Darien.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well at first I didn't think much of the crowd outside. It doesn't happen often, usually only when a club night is close to a major church event. Tonight though they gathered earlier than usual and there was a bigger crowd. Otherwise, since I live upstairs I didn't notice too much except people coming in were more freaked than usual."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mortiss took up where Darien left off. "I arrived fifteen minutes before the doors opened, about the usual time for my shift, and the crowd was quite large. What I notice right away was they were chanting more vicious things than usual. Most of the time its 'Jesus loves you', 'don't go in', and things like that. Tonight it was more the your going to hell, loosing your soul kinds of things. Most of the action seemed to center around one older woman. Where ever she was in the crowd the calls were more strident and nasty. The people further away from her seemed a bit less certain, almost like they were disoriented or confused in some way. Anyway, it was really freaking a lot of the regulars, like Darien noticed as well. The only other really freaky thing I noticed was Ennui doing some weird magic like thing after she shoved Dementia into the club. Well, then there was the whole car through the wall action. That was really bad."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"When Ennui and I showed up it was like the one woman was able to immediately see us. She targeted me with the worst of the insults, yet inside it was Ennui it went after." Dementia added.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I can answer that," Ennui replied. "It went after the sorceress. It could taste the flavor of my magic. It's a classic tactic. Kill the sorceress first, then move on to the others."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How did you know that?" Dementia asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui laughed. "Everyone knows at least one fantasy role player who describes their games in nauseating detail. The one I knew played wizards all the time. I lost count of the lectures I got on magic 'theory'."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She's absolutely right. What I'm curious about are the spells you cast."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not entirely sure, Lady. I guess they were guards and wards of some form. They just felt right at the time."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I figured that. They were quite powerful though. By all rights you should be back in the bed room almost unconscious after spending that much personal energy."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why use personal energy when there is all that electricity in the walls just waiting to do one's bidding?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The dark Lady smiled and commented warmly, "Very impressive young lady. Few make that intuitive leap after years of practice. I have not known anyone to make it the first time the magic awakens in them."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I am so busted." Ennui laughed again, "You caught me. I was actually the one playing in the game. We were quite a creative group when it came to getting out of things. This one time..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hold on Ennui, I don't think we have time for 'no shit there we were' stories right now," Mortiss interrupted.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So true young sir. This is just as I feared. It has happened at last. The balance has been broken and one of the proxy gods has found a way to draw Eternia into their petty squabbles. I am sorry you to had to witness the coming of the storm. Darien and Mortiss I am afraid I have some bad news for you. The two of you died back there in the club. That is why Darien couldn't use the phone and why Mortiss saw his own body. You now have a choice. You died in an event that directly effects Eternia and as a result of its existence. Because of this I am honor bound to offer you a chance to join us. You can go on to the afterlife of your choice or you may sign on to the Death City Metro. If you choose this path know that if you die in the service of Eternia it is the final death. If you choose instead to go to the afterlife you will return or not as fits the afterlife you have chosen. I am afraid I can only give you an hour to think about it. When we arrive in Eternia you must choose either to take a Sacred Unit to the afterlives or to continue into Eternia. You may ask Dementia and Ennui about it if you like." She bowed deeply to each in turn. "I salute you all. You have survived the beginnings of a turmoil the likes of which we have never seen. Good life to you all." Her form shimmered and faded away.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dead? What the fuck? What happened to you Ennui? Car crash or something?" Mortiss exclaimed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, actually it's one of those things it's considered very rude to ask. You know, like asking if I have my period, stuff like that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ewww, girl stuff, gross. Ok, but dead, damn. There was this new girl coming in tonight and..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, yeah, give it a rest will you? We need to think about what to do next." Darien interrupted. "Although it begs the question of why Ennui was here when she was supposed to be home with her folks."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hello, still in the room. Longish story, not really important. More important is that you ask enough to decide your fates in the next half hour say?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So what is this Death City about anyway?" As Dementia explained Ennui could see them becoming more thoughtful. Finally as she finished Mortiss asked, "So, where are the good clubs? If there are good clubs I'm in. Darien, how about you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. The final death, that seems, well final."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, but you heard her, it's not very often that it happens before you're ready. So, about the clubs..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, now that you mention it. There aren't any, yet. Dementia and I were here so I could show her an example. We are going to create the perfect club in Death City! And we could always use the help of those who know the scene. As well as a good bar tender."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm in!" Mortiss answered enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, I'll try it. I can always change my mind, correct?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Up to the time of your final death, yes." Dementia assured him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Darien, do you accept the charter of Eternia," Dementia asked formally.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I accept the charter."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mortiss, do you accept the charter of Eternia?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I accept the charter."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome to the roles of Eternia. May you be a credit to yourself and Eternia." As Dementia stopped speaking her face twisted into a rictus of pain. She dropped to the floor screaming. "No, no, ..." Her muscles clenched wrenching her back into a rigid spasm.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui rushed to her and held her close, "Dementia. Hold on. We're here." After long minutes the spasm passed and Dementia collapsed into a puddle of limp flesh in Ennui's arms. Her eyes opened slowly, not really focusing on anything as she whispered, "Malthasius, we have to get to Malthasius. Allen, someone tell Allen..." Her eyes rolled back in her head and she dropped into unconsciousness.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Darien, there is a com unit in the drawer near the chair to your left. Could you reach in and hand it to me?" Carefully she lowered Dementia to the floor and took the com. "Allen? Ennui again. Could you redirect us to a place called Malthasius? Dementia has had some type of seizure and was most emphatic about it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Surely. I've heard of her visions."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui replaced the com and turned to Mortiss. "Could you give me a hand getting her to bed?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Carefully they lifted DEmentia and carried her to the bed room. Ennui arranged her comfortably on the bed, watched her for a few minutes until she heard Darien call from the passage. "Hey, Ennui, Allen for you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'll be back to check on you," she whispered to Dementia's unconscious form before she hurried out. "Allen, what's happening?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We're cleared on a straight shot to Malthasius. Should arrive in twenty minutes. Dispatch wants to know what we find in case they have to send support teams."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui, what's this all about?" Darien asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I've only been here for a day longer than you. Dementia said she gets visions from time to time about dangers threatening the recovery teams. Hopefully she will be better by the time we arrive. I'd better go keep an eye on her. There's music in the cabinet near the samovar. Put on something you like." She hurried back to the bed room and sat on the floor by the bed once more. "You know, this is getting to be a bad habit."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know," a soft voice answered back. "Could you get me water?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Quickly Ennui strode to the kitchen, filled a glass with water, and hurried back. "Thanks. Are we underway?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, arrival in ten to fifteen minutes."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good. You'll need to do this for me. Tonight has taken too much... Anyway, find Lauren, she's in charge I think. Tell her, 'the basement holds a door. Beware the door. It is not the way. Do not open it.' Can you remember that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Don't open the door in the basement. Got it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia's head snapped back into her pillow as she hissed, Fuck, fuck, fuck..." Her head smashed back into the pillow for several minutes and then her neck relaxed. "Bad...tell Lauren, 'Get them out, get them out now!' Ennui..." Dementia gasped, grabbing her hand. "Tell.." she slumped back to the bed unconscious once more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui, is she ok? We heard yelling..." Darien cried as he and Mortiss charged into the room.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Another vision. A bad one. I'm not sure if she's ok." She felt the train slowing as it approached a stop. "Good, we're arriving. Darien, could you stay with Ennui. Mortiss, come with me. We're looking for someone named Lauren." Ennui strode toward the door to the outside.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She opened the door onto a sun baked ruin. Once again shattered buildings stretched off in all directions. This ruin looked like it had been a major population center. Mortiss stopped at the door and stared. "What is this?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This is what we do. We recover the created beauty of dead or dying worlds. Come on, you can look later." Ennui led the way down with Mortiss following reluctantly after. She picked her way through piles of crumbled concrete and shattered brick toward a small group of people. They were loading items onto a gently bobbing cart. "Hello. I am Ennui and this is Mortiss. We have some additional information for Lauren. Could you tell us where to find her?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She's about four rubble piles that way," one of the men replied, pointing to a larger pile off to the right. "I think she said something about heading down into a basement."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks." Ennui replied as calmly as she could before hurrying off in the direction indicated. As soon as she was a bit away from the group she broke into a fast jog, slipping dangerously on the broken and uneven ground. Once she crashed to her knees, opening a long gash on one and embedding a nasty splinter into her left palm. Immediately she was up again. Limping and cursing under her breath she arrived at a large excavation with broken steps going down into a dark hole.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowing down a bit she scrambled into the pit. As she descended she followed the faint light coming from the corridor ahead. She burst into a large storage area just as a woman was reaching for a plain steel door.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Lauren, stop."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Who?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm Ennui. I have a message from Dementia. She says you aren't supposed to open that door under any circumstance." She was about to elaborate when she caught a flicker out of the corner of her eye. The center of the door began to glow reddish as magical energy painted over it. "Lauren, get your people out. Get them out now!" Ennui shrieked as her hands became a blur.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You heard the woman. Come on people, out of here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We haven't found..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Later Jeff. Dementia has never been wrong." Lauren pushed people toward the corridor as she went. "Ok Ennui. TIme for you to go."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, get out. I'll be along as soon as everyone's clear." Lauren hesitated for a moment, then she saw the door beginning to sag and run like thick custard. "We're gone. Get clear yourself."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui fed more energy into her spell and threw it full force at the door. For a moment the viscous liquid solidified, then it began to bubble and melt again. Staggering from exhaustion Ennui stumbled toward the door. Mortiss, who had been standing in the shadows, raced forward and grabbed her. He half helped and half dragged her up the stairs. As she reached the top she pulled away from him. Dropping to her knees she slowly wove another pattern and then released. A bright blob of violet raced to the ceiling of the lower corridor and exploded. Immediately tons of cement and brick from the shattered building above crashed down to fill the void. Ennui dropped to the rubble and lay on her side breathing in wheezing gasps. "Lauren," she whispered hoarsely. "Lauren, get your people out of here. That was Dementia's other message."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lauren stared down at her. "When we get back I'd like to get a beer with you." She watched Ennui for a moment longer, then spun to her team. "This mission is over. Grab what we've got and lets go. You," she said, pointing at Mortiss. "I owe her. Don't let anything happen to her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes ma'am," Mortiss stammered. He reached down and carefully helped Ennui up.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Don't let go. I can't stand on my own." She whispered. "I'll find you for that drink Lauren. Ok Mortiss, lets get back."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly they limped back to Dementia's train. As they stepped up onto the back platform a tremendous shudder rolled through the ground. Where the basement rubble pile was a plume of dust and debris fountained upward. As it settled dark twisted beings erupted from the new hole. Ennui dove toward the com, landing hard near it. "Allen, get us out of here." She half shouted into the com.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"With pleasure lady Ennui." The train lurched sharply as Allen applied maximum power to the locomotive. Swiftly the train pulled away from the dark screaming figures.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui staggered down the passage and into the bed room. There she dropped to the mattress next to Dementia and fell into exhausted slumber.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui awoke to Dementia saying, "You're right, this is getting to be a bad habit. Hey sleepy, Mortiss told me about your little adventure. Remind me not to piss you off. I would let you sleep, however Merris in Dispatch would like to see us before we head down to the city."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, but that is no fun with no local sources of energy. Gods, I thought it was over for a while there."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You did well from the sounds of it. You've got about five minutes before we hit the station to wake up. In the future, how long would you like when I need to wake you up from exhaustion?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Don't? I know, not an option, so five minutes is good. Doesn't give me enough time to become properly resentful." Ennui followed Dementia off the train and across the platform to the entrance to the station. Inside Dementia led the way to a door marked "Dispatch" and knocked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A young man's face appeared as the door opened a small amount. "Yes?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dementia and Ennui to see Merris."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just a minute." The door closed again, only to open a couple of minutes later. "Follow me." He turned and threaded his way past several people staring intently at computer screens. On the far side of the room was a platform with three monitors and a harried looking blonde haired woman. As they approached  the young man said, "Merris, they're here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks John, and could you bring us a couple of chairs?" She looked at the two in front of her. "Sorry, I never remember the chairs," she apologized as she ran a nervous hand through her hair. "Thanks John. Please, have a seat." Merris studied them for a few moments. While she did Ennui was studying her as well. Merris looked to be of average height and a bit on the thin side. Her face showed care lines and age, making her look neither old nor young. She was dressed in a faded black T-shirt and dark jeans. She spoke, pulling Ennui out of her inspection, "So, what the Lady has feared has happened then?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," Dementia answered. "The dark forces have broken the truce."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I wish to apologize for interrupting your return journey, however there is something I think is critically important." Merris reached onto her desk and picked up a portable com set. "This links directly to my station and to my assistant's station. Please call us on it any time you receive a vision. No one expects the two of you to respond every time. This will allow us to send help as rapidly as possible when things are going to happen. Now I will let you get some sleep."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They returned to the train and fell back into bed. Immediately they fell asleep, not even waking when Allen uncoupled the locomotive at the carriage yards.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">It was late afternoon when they final awoke again. On the counter in the kitchen was a brief note, "Gone with Allen. He says to meet us at the Adam and Eve when you wake up. Mortiss and Darien."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Coffeeeee," mumbled Ennui. "Must make coffee."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Come sleepy one. We can get excellent coffee at the pub. A shower would be better unless you like the look of disaster victim." After Ennui's shower they threw on a change of clothes and headed out.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You know, you could stay with me for a while. Until we find the club and all..." Dementia started hesitantly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yesterday it sounded like you couldn't wait to get your space back."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well that was before you proved how useful you were. And before I had so many of those visions in one stretch. I kind of like knowing there's someone to drag me off the floor when I collapse."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I guess I could... Wasn't like I had anything in mind yet." Ennui replied slowly. "Sure, why not. That Merris person's intense."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Nice change of subject..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know, but I was just thinking about last night and her stopping us for that kind of weird request. She could have just waited, couldn't she?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, but she is head of dispatch, which means every train outside the Portal is her responsibility. Dispatch assigns missions, figures out train requirements, and sets crew needs. That information is then sent to the locomotive and carriage yards for train assembly and to Central Station for crew assignments. I can see where she's want word of these visions as soon as it was available. Especially now that we aren't as safe as we used to be." They finished the walk in silence, each lost in thought about the events of the last day.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At the pub they found the guys in animated conversation with Allen and a couple of others. Darien looked up and waved them over, "Ennui, Dementia, this is Gordon and Martin from Temple Heath. We've just been talking about this place. You guys sleep ok? We were going to wake you but you looked too cute zonked out like you were."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, that's right. Pick on the exhausted. All you did was watch Dementia sleep. Mortiss has some slack, but not you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm wounded. And after you said all those nice things about me earlier."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Earlier I was trying to talk you down on drink prices." Jo arrived while Ennui was teasing Darien.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, what can I bring you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Coffee please, and coffee for Dementia as well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Any food? The specials are pub burgers or fish and chips."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Pub burger please," replied Ennui.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Fish and chips for me," Dementia added. As Jo walked away she asked, "So are these guys getting you filled in on how things work around here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That we are, and we were talking about the club you two want to start. Sounds like there are quite a few people here that would be interested. You know, I've seen a few in New York when I was an intern there. If you'd like my help with layouts..." Darien responded.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That'd be great!" Ennui shook her head, "You know it's really weird. I saw you guys die and I should be grieving, yet here we all are having coffee. This really fucks with the way I've always known things to work."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well imagine it from our side. At least we know there's an afterlife now. But it really sucks that we can't go back and tell anyone about it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You get used to it. Trust me." Dementia replied as Allen nodded in agreement. "Normally you've been in Eternia a while though before you are on a mission to collect a new recruit. It really brings it all home. Although you can go back, sort of. You can return to the Realms on missions however you will look different enough that no one would recognize you. And typically you aren't sent to places where you lived. It's just cruel to inflict that on people."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Um, yeah, I guess I can see that... So, you know, this is a little too creepy right now. What should we do next?" Mortiss interjected.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well Dementia and I were going to get food and then, I don't know, maybe look for club space. You guys need to look for places to stay I would think."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I was just telling the guys they can possibly get rooms here for a few days anyway," Allen added.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm wondering how that works, Dementia and I haven't had much chance to talk about it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, typically you just find somewhere were you want to stay. It's as simple and complicated as that. Dementia chose to live in a train car and there are quite a few mission loving people that do the same. Others chose to live in houses or apartments or on the street..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"On the street!?" Ennui exclaimed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, on the street. This is a place of healing for many people. You end up finding the places that make you feel the most comfortable. There are people that don't like the closed in feeling of buildings," Allen explained. "Most of us find there is a place somewhere in Eternia that draws us in. That is usually how you find where you will stay. I work at Temple Heath, so I live in one of the houses nearby. The owners of this pub live upstairs and make their spare rooms available for new arrivals on an as needed basis."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We could all hunt club space for a while after Mortiss and I see if we can stay here for a little while. Sounds like the where to live question usually sorts itself out. The club issue seems like it will require more effort. I'll be right back. I'm going to see if we can stay here." Darien stood and was about to walk to the bar when Jo arrived back with food and coffee. "Jo, would it be possible for Mortiss and I to stay here for a few days? Allen said you might have a room or two we could have for a little bit."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think so. I'll check with my da and see."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know of any old warehouse type buildings around here?" Mortiss asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Warehouses? Sure, over by the rail yards."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I was thinking more ones that weren't in use any more. Ones that could be turned into something else rather than active ones."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jo looked thoughtful for a few moments, "I think there are some across the river. You could go check. I'll let you know about rooms as soon as I take care of a couple of other orders." She headed away, returning five minutes later with the answer that there was one room the guys could share.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui and Dementia finished their food and then they headed back out into the late afternoon. Allen and the other two from Temple Heath headed back that way as the other four headed toward the river.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once across they found themselves in a more industrialized section of town. There were large sections of warehouses and factories. Sections were bustling with activity while others had fallen into disuse. Prowling around the side streets they found breweries, bakeries, slaughter houses, and green grocers, all the support services for a thriving city but nothing that called to them as the future club they wanted to build.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Coming to yet another section of thriving industry they turned to retrace their steps when they saw an overgrown cobbled way leading down toward the river. Dementia was about to move on until Ennui pulled her down the lane. "This one feels promising." Where the street crossed a set of railroad tracks near the river they saw it. In front of them was a run down three story brick building. Two corner towers poked up to form a partial fourth floor.  In faded letters across the front were the words "Feldstadt Brewing and Malting".</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Walking around it they saw an overgrown cart yard and a platform next to the rail line. In the back the building extended as a two story section and then dropped to a one story section, making it three times as big as it had looked from the front.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui leapt up onto the rail platform and strode purposefully to the freight doors. Crossing to the personnel door she hauled it open and stepped in. The smell of old grain and brewing wafted over her. Surprised that it didn't smell anywhere near as musty as it should have, she walked deeper into the building. Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sunlight as Ennui crossed the loading area and down a passage toward the front of the building. Ahead of her light streamed in through the front windows showing the holes in the floor where vast round tanks had once crouched. Overhead pipe clips and fittings still told of a vast network of plumbing. The smell of cooked grains and fermentation wafted up out of the dark pits.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We should get some lights," Mortiss called. "Then we can check out the inner areas as well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, this is cool!" Darien added. "We could really make this place work. What do you think it was?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well the sign on the building sort of makes me think it might have been a brewery. Its pretty wild how it looks something like the abandoned one near my neighborhood. Kind of the same as inside too. A few of us skipped classes one day and broke in before the city started to refurbish it. Now it's offices and storage spaces. It had the same openings and piping things happening. Same basic smells too," Ennui answered.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, too bad it wasn't still set up."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Darien, would you want to run it?" Mortiss asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, no. I just thought...anyway awfully convenient it being here like this."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Convenient, yes, maybe, or maybe it's here because we wanted it to be here. That's the way you said it worked wasn't it Dementia?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, that is often the way it works here. The four of us wanting it badly enough could have called it here. That would explain why it looks like something Ennui remembers."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Trippy. In that case maybe all we need is someone who knows electricity to turn on the lights," Darien added. "Maybe Allen knows someone. I'll ask him tonight. He was saying a lot of the Temple Heath people hang out at the Adam and Eve every night."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think that would be very likely actually."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I say we head back, ask someone to help with the lights, and then we begin planning," Ennui recommended. They made their way back to the loading area and out into the fading daylight.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What's to keep someone else from hijacking it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Be serious Mortiss, if someone had wanted it they would already have it. I think this is ours. I think Ennui's right. We called it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They walked the rest of the way back in silence. Each of them lost in thoughts of what to do with their find. At the ADam and Eve Darien made his way to the lower section of the pub and eased through the crowd to a large table in the center of the room. Spotting Allen he dodged through the crowd until he was near him. Just as he bent to talk Bart spotted Dementia and Ennui. "Hey girls. COme to join us?" The conversations at the table slowed as everyone looked up to see who Bart was talking to.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I guess. We came to talk to Allen."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's fine. Sit, join us, have some dinner and talk to Allen," he made quick introductions around the table not really noticing that Ennui had glazed over.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I won't remember any of them," Ennui whispered to Dementia.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok. You aren't really expected to." Dementia whispered back. The conversation at the table returned to whatever they had been before their approach.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui glanced toward Darien and found him in deep conversation with Allen. "Hopefully that's a good sign!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So, I heard the trip wasn't as quiet as it should have been." Bart prompted quietly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Allen been telling?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He mentioned there was trouble. Something about deaths..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Should we be talking of this here?" Ennui asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This isn't the Realms. That which effects us all often gets brought up when it needs to be," Bart answered gently. "It should be ok, otherwise the Lady would have told you not to talk of it." He laughed softly at Ennui's expression. "She always appears when there is a threat to her own."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She believes the truce has been broken," Dementia replied. "We escaped, however our two new companions died in the disagreements. Since they were killed in an Eternia related event they were given the choice to join us. Then there was a second attack on Lauren's party. We were able to warn them in time, however this time it was an actual attack rather than a scare attempt."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Bart looked thoughtful. "I see. I guess it had to happen sometime. It is a pity, but not unexpected. We should accept the moments outside the storm as the blessings they are then." He looked down at his drink for a few minutes, shook his head slightly, then launched back into the technical conversation flowing across the table.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui, Dementia, what can I get you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Jo, don't you ever get a break?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sometimes. I'm working double today because Becka is out on a short mission. I should be back on evenings only tomorrow. You guys have any luck with warehouses?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui launched into an excited description of their afternoon find. "Sounds good. I guess I never was too sure what was over there other than a few of our suppliers. Skull and Bones Brewing Company, Prelate Breads and Pastries and Argonath Green Grocers. There's some heavy industry as well isn't there?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Most of it has moved out to the stretch between Death City and Londrel. I think there's some small industry left in town. Enough that we still run the local loop trains. So what were you looking to do with this dream building? I'm not quite sure from your descriptions."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Create a club where you can go and listen to loud music and dance. Something it seems is missing in town. Maybe create some apartments above it for living. Seems like it could be a great place to get together and unwind after the missions people are going on."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good luck with it then. Some of my guys might be interested as well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui! Allen's good with electricity. He says he can come with us in the morning and see if we can get things back on."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not to rush you too much but I'd like to get your orders so I can move on?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, sorry Jo." They proceeded to order food and drink then they returned to listening to the conversations around the table.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was quite late when Ennui and Dementia stepped out into the night. The swayed their way back to Dementia's coach and fell into bed. In the morning they headed back to the pub to meet up with the guys. After a large breakfast they crossed the river and guided Allen to the old brewery. He set down the bag he was carrying and extracted a large portable lamp. Inside he looked around at the loading area before heading off into the gloom at the back of the building. Searching through several rooms he finally found the narrow stairway he seemed to be looking for. Confidently he strode down into the basements. Periodically looking at the tangle of conduits and piping overhead he navigated his way to a large metal door. Blazoned on it was the standard High Voltage warning signs. With a grin he pulled open the door and stepped into the utility section. It took him very little time to find the main panel and reset the switched. Immediately the bare overhead bulbs sprang to life, searing the eyes of the small group. "Told you I could find it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Totally awesome Allen." Darien praised as he slapped Allen on the back. "Now let's check this out for real."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The five of them spent the rest of the day prowling from floor to floor and room to room in the building. The large basement room under the tall section of the building would become the dance floor. The holes in the main floor would be left but roped off to allow people in the restaurant and bar to see the dance floor below. The floors above would become apartments of various sizes. The two towers were claimed by Dementia and Ennui for their rooms. The loading area and some of the back rooms would become storage and kitchen facilities. At last they came to the most important decision to be made. the decision of what to name the club.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Arguments flew thick and fast as they walked back to the pub for dinner. They were still arguing as they entered. Jo looked up as they passed, still deep into another shouting match. "Gods, you sound like a bunch of cats yowling along the back fence. What are you trying to figure out anyway?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We need a good name for a gothic, industrial style club. We can't seem to come to any agreement."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wait, I've got another one..." Mortiss started as everyone else groaned. "Well, part of one anyway." He stopped talking as the others kept going.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, were you going to tell us or not?" Dementia snapped.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't think you wanted me to."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Damn it man, just out with it," growled Darien.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It should have Cathouse in it. Great idea Jo, thanks."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Cathouse? That's..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Darien started to say it was bad before Ennui interrupted him. "That's great. I've got it. I've got it. How about Devil's Cathouse?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Darien and Mortiss stopped in mid sentence. Dementia looked thoughtful for a second before she laughed and said, "Wonderful! Devil's Cathouse it is!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But doesn't that imply, you know, like a brothel or something? Doesn't seem a very girl friendly kind of name," Darien said, shocked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I disagree. I think it works," Ennui replied. "It has a bad girl and level of the abyss sound to it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We start building on it tomorrow!" Dementia exclaimed. "Allen, is Bart the one to talk to if we need to move local freight? I'm thinking we can get some of the stuff we want from the pool of rescued items. Most of that ends up in the Lower City."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Bart should be able to set it up. I'd like to help too. I can ask for local loop duties, that way I will have plenty of time available."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How about bands?" Ennui asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Bands? I haven't heard of any here that would fit the theme. We'd probably have to do DJs, unless you could find a band or get one started."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Get one started...Now there's a thought. Although if this is like bands in the Realms it's much easier thought of than done," Ennui mused. "Could you guys ask around when you can and I will as well. I can play a bit of bass..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, sure. I can't see any of those Temple Heath guys being into it, but I guess it wouldn't hurt to ask. Maybe they know others though."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We can ask..." Mortiss began "Though we know fewer people than you, oh veteran of a day longer than us..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A week after they started the construction a foppishly dressed young man walked up to the warehouse. He was thin, hawk faced, with long wavy blonde hair and light blue eyes. He looked around at the bustling activity of construction until he noticed Allen. Slowly approaching he asked, "Are you Allen?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I am. What do you need?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Tom at Temple Heath told me there's a goth band forming up somewhere around here? I was told to talk to you about finding some chick who is actually starting it..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That would be Ennui. Follow me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Allen picked up the next load of two by fours and headed into the building. He raised an eyebrow when the stranger didn't even offer to help but didn't comment. Inside he threaded his way to the back where Dementia and Ennui were framing in part of the kitchen storage. "Hey Ennui, got someone here for the band. Ennui, this is..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Danny Cleveland, but you can call me Le Mort," He bowed deeply and touched her hand. "I sing."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Pleased to meet you. I play bass, somewhat. If we get lucky and get a real player you may not have to find out how badly somewhat really is."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Le Mort looked a little nonplussed. "You mean there's no one else yet?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Nope. You're the first. So you get to skip the audition part for now anyway. If you know of anyone else looking to play drag them down here and we can see what this will turn into."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Two days later another person showed up shortly before nightfall. She was average height, solidly built with wavy dark brown hair, brown eyes and a rather plain face. She watched Dementia grab a box of tile from a stack and head into the building. Quickly she grabbed a box of her own and followed her in. "Excuse me, my name is Nightshade. I'm looking for Ennui. I heard she's trying to start a band?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Come with me. We're working on the third floor right now. Oh, and thanks for grabbing that box. You can bring it up as well." When they arrived Dementia dropped the box of tile in the bathroom where Darien was working and took the woman up to the tower where Ennui was framing in several interior dividers. "Ennui, this is Nightshade. She's asking about the band."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome! I guess the first question is what do you play?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Drums mostly, although I can do a wide variety of percussion kinds of things. What talents do you have so far?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Someone who says he sings and myself who kind of plays bass. Maybe we should get together sometime and the three of us just see what we can do."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm available just about any time as long as I can get a day's warning. So just let me know. You can leave a message with Jo at the Adam and Eve or stop by where I work. I'm at the Skull and Bones Brewing Company just up the street a couple of blocks. We supply the Adam and Eve with most of their beers."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Cool! What do you do at the brewery?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Brew mistress."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Way cool! Would you be able to supply us, the Devil's Cathouse that is, as well then?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Devil's Cathouse? That one'll get remembered."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's one of the hopes, yes."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So what kind of a theme is this club going to have? The obvious one from the name or something else?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, I could see a mix between cathouse and mad scientist's lab. I was always a sucker for the "Monster Mash" song and all the Frankenstein based films."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds really fun. You know, I know someone that does industrial glassware fabrication. He made some of the stuff I needed for the brewery. You might be able to have him create some fancy things for the bar. Maybe some giant chemistry set looking thing to smoke and bubble. It would be a great atmosphere piece."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey Dementia, Nightshade has a great idea for the theme aspects of the bar..." Dementia was soon smiling and nodding as they outline the idea. It rapidly expanded to include drink dispensing and chemistry set themed glassware for serving drinks in as well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After four more days Ennui was about ready to tell Le Mort and Nightshade that the band was not going to happen. She had just come out of the Cathouse and was starting up the street when two women approached her. One was a medium tall blonde with wild wavy hair and a pleasant face. The other was a slightly shorter, wire thin red head. The redhead spoke as they approached. "We heard from Nightshade that you were forming a band. I play electric guitar and sing a bit. Belladonna plays keyboards."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The blonde spoke up, "Nausea and I weren't sure we should come by. I mean she's good, but I'm just really average at keys."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui smiled, "That's ok. I'm guessing you're better on keys than I am on bass. We can have some fun and see if this goes anywhere. If we feel good about it we can play at the club once we get it open."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Over the next months the five worked continuously on the Cathouse. Slowly it began to come together. Melissa in rescued items sorting held back items she knew they needed. Once a day Allen would take a small train down and pick up the supplies they needed. Dementia only woke up twice with visions that demanded a call to Merris. In both cases the warning came soon enough to avoid loss of life.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly the band came together as well. They began rehearsing on the dance floor of the Cathouse once the construction had moved on. It gave them a chance to improve their abilities and figure out how they would sound in a large space. A stage was constructed half way between the bar floor and the dance floor to give them an area to perform on. It also provided another path from the bar floor to the dance floor and additional dance space when no live bands were scheduled.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once the main section and five apartments of the Cathouse were finished everyone moved in. Eagerly Dementia and Ennui moved their personal effects  from the rail car to their new apartments above. Both were looking forward to their own space and some additional room to spread out. Darien and Mortiss had an easier time since any items they had collected they had already stored in their new rooms.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia had chosen decor based around intricate cravings and light, airy constructions. Her doorways were arches formed of intricate designs and traceries. Brightly colored woven rugs covered large sections of the refinished warehouse flooring. Ornate brass work held candles and lights. One windows that faced other buildings she had carved wooden screens set in place to allow air flow but provide privacy.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui chose dark and heavy furnishings and wrought iron for decoration and lighting. She likes dark rich velvets and heavy brocades for furniture coverings and wall hangings. She has left her floors mostly the refinished scarred dark wood of the warehouse floor. She allows a bit of delicacy in the lace curtains on her windows.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In the interest of more space they built an attaching section between the tow original towers that contained a shared bath facility. It also held additional storage space for both of them and a way to talk to each other without having to go down to the common hall and then climb back up again.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The first night they both collapsed into their new beds in anticipation of plenty of room to sprawl out in. After all the effort of moving they rapidly fell asleep.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui was yanked awake by a shriek of terror echoing down the connecting hall. Leaping out of bed on her adrenalin rush she dashed down the hall only to crash into Dementia running toward her. Grabbing each other for support they sank to the floor. "Oh gods, oh gods..." Dementia sobbed. "It was awful."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shh, I've got you. I've got you. Let's get you back to bed..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, not yet. Please not yet!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How about we go back and sit down then?" Ennui asked as she slowly helped Dementia up. They walked slowly back into Dementia's rooms and over to a brass and silk couch near one of the windows. Ennui eased Dementia down and then settled in next to her. They stayed close together for almost an hour before Dementia said she felt well enough to try to sleep again. Ennui followed her into her bedroom and settled her into bed. She kept watch until Dementia had fallen back into sleep. After assuring herself that Dementia was truly asleep Ennui returned to her own bed and slowly drifted into sleep.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A couple of hours later screams echoed through the rooms again. This time it was Dementia who bolted awake and ran toward Ennui's rooms. She made it into Ennui's sitting room only to find Ennui curled up on the floor rocking slowly. Her eyes were fixed on empty space as she whimpered, moaned and rocked. Dementia gently pulled her into her arms and stroked her hair. After many minutes Ennui's eyes began to clear. Suddenly she wrapped her arms tightly around Dementia and shook like a leaf in the wind. "Chasing me. Formless things chasing me, wanting to tear at me, feed off me. Goddess, it was so real, so real..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I've got you. I won't let it get you." Carefully Dementia eased them both onto Ennui's bed. She held her until the blood red light of morning peeped through the blinds. She continued to hold Ennui until the full light of morning had chased most of the shadows from the room. When she was finally certain her friend had stopped shaking she asked, "Would you like coffee?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui nodded, "And maybe an Adam and Eve breakfast as well..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shall I go get it or would you like to come along?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I...I think I'm better. I'd like to come along."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"By ourselves or do you want to invite the guys along as well?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"By ourselves I think," Ennui answered as she pulled on clothes. Ennui followed Dementia to her place and waited for her to dress as well. Ten minutes later they were out in the morning light and on their way to the pub.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once they were seated and had food in front of them Ennui asked slowly, "I hope last night was a one time only bad deal. Once was way too many times for me. Remind me to never say anything about your visions, just in case I already have..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'll remind you, but you haven't yet. I agree, I hope that's it." They finished their food and returned to the Cathouse to spend another day building additional apartments. They worked on the next improvements along with the guys in relative silence until mid afternoon. Finally Ennui asked, "Did you guys sleep ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's an odd question...but yes I did anyway, Mortiss?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Fine, I guess. I have a bit of trouble when I'm first in a new place, but other than that, ok. Why?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No strange dreams or anything?" Dementia asked slowly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, not that I remember. Again, why?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We both had terrible nightmares last night. I guess I was kind of wondering if maybe the building had weird energies or something..." Ennui answered embarrassed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Weird energies?" Darien asked. "No, nothing like that. Odd creaking noises once or twice, but that was it." Ennui let the conversation slide back to construction topics for the rest of the day.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Late in the evening they once more retired to bed. Once again about an hour after sleep took them Dementia awoke shrieking. "Shit, shit, shit. I guess it wasn't one time only..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Let's try something, I'll stay in your room a while tonight and see if that helps. Tomorrow maybe we should try sleeping somewhere else and see if it is the building. You know how guys can be, sometimes they just aren't all that sensitive."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok." Ennui followed Dementia back to bed and sat down on the floor like she had in the train car. Immediately Dementia patted the bed, "Oh no you don't. I want you to be comfortable as well." Ennui gave a crooked smile and climbed in beside her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just like old times. Sleep well." They drifted off and slept peacefully for the rest of the night.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The following night found them at the Adam and Eve asking Jo for rooms for the night. They explained the fear of some type of weird energy in the Cathouse building which immediately got them rooms. Once again they retired, this time after several rounds with the Temple Heath crowd. SLeep once again came slowly, only to be shattered once again with screams of terror from Ennui's room. Once again peaceful sleep only came when they were together.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sitting over coffee the next morning they apologized once more to Jo and her father for the disturbances during the night. Then each returned to staring moodily into their cups. "So, looks like we have nightmares if we sleep too far apart."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What's really fucked up with this is I had the occasional vision before you arrived, but never did I have the nightmares."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that," slow tears fell into Ennui's coffee as she stared deep into it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia reached a hand out and placed it on Ennui's, "It's not your fault. That just doesn't make sense. Something is changing. I've had kind of pre-vision feelings like that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean, pre-visions?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I get two kinds of things. I get the full visions like you saw the first night. In those I see what's going to happen with greater or lesser time between vision and events. Then I get feelings, kind of like shivers or resonances... It's really hard to explain those. It's more of just a sense of danger or fear or happiness... Just a strong feeling of what types of emotions will be strongest for a given event. What I feel right now is a sense of dread and anticipation. Something is changing but I'm not even sure the Lady really knows how it's going to be yet. Sometimes it feels really near, other times it feels like we have some time yet."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Damn. I'll stick with what nightmares I get. That's just too creepy." They rose and headed back toward the club. "I'm sorry I'm not, you know, interested..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok. You're the best friend I've had and that is much more important than the other for me right now. Now, we should get back to it. We have a club to open in a few days. The band is sounding really good. Did you want to play the opening? It'd certainly be more memorable than a DJ open..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I'll ask the others at practice tomorrow. Guess we'd need to finally decide on a name though. That has been going very slowly. We can't reach any sort of agreement."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui and the band were arguing on the stage about band names again when Darien walked by. He stopped to listen for a few minutes and then shouted up at them, "Why don't you call yourselves Love's Bitch, since all you do is bitch about things anyway..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But what's love got to do with it then?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Supposedly people play music cause they love it, right?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Go back to work," Le Mort shouted down at him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, wait. I kind of like it," Nightshade commented slowly. "Reminds me of a line from something, but I can't quite place it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It is memorable, isn't it?" Belladonna added.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well I think it sucks. It sounds too much like a chick thing," Le Mort pouted.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Awww, wittle Mortie got a problem with chicks?" Nausea taunted. "Seems like this would be any guy's fantasy, four girls, one guy, and loud music..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, if any of you were interested..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We'd have a better chance of that if you weren't hitting on us every time we moved," Ennui tossed back.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's just you're all so damn hot. I can't help myself."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"All the more reason to open the club as a band. Mortie will have plenty of girls to swoon over him," Nightshade added.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Does that still work?" Ennui asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hell, I don't know. But it sounds good anyway," Nightshade replied.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So, we have another name on the floor. All those that can live with Love's Bitch, raise your hands," Ennui called. Her hand shot up immediately, as did Nightshade's and Belladonna's. Nausea thought for a moment and slowly raised her hand. Everyone turned to look at Le Mort.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He stared back at them for a few minutes then slowly raised his hand as well. "I guess I can live with it..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"All right then! I'll let Dementia know later. So, next question, do we open for the club?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hell yes! Anything for a chance at women."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mortie, you are such a pig," Nausea commented fondly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But I'm the band's pig," Le Mort fired back.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good. I think this will be good. Now shall we run through the set list again? Dementia wants to open next friday night. That only gives us eight more days to practice in."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As practice wound to a close Belladonna looked up from her keyboard and asked, "What are we going to wear?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What?" Ennui asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What are we going to wear. We're kind of a goth band opening for a new club. It wouldn't be right to look like this." She motioned to the everyday wear they all had on. "We need a theme or at least some sort of costume ideas..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I do a mean cat morph. I did it for a theatrical makeup class and liked it so much I would do it once in a while to keep my hand in," Nightshade replied.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Proper Vampire is my look," Le Mort replied hautily.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I always liked the bride of Frankenstein look myself," Ennui tossed in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Me too," added Belladonna and Nausea almost as one.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, that should fit. The club theme is mad scientist's castle meets cathouse so a few props and we fit right in," Ennui enthused.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The finishing touches of the club rapidly came together during the last week. Thadeus delivered two elaborate glass contraptions for the upper and lower bars. When turned on they smoked and bubbled like a demented scientist's dream. Attached at various points were tear drop shaped vessels for holding liquors of various types. Carefully he explained to Dementia and Ennui the connections to each section. After a couple of hours practice and copious notes they felt they could assemble drinks from the glass monstrosities.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Wall decorations, heavy curtains, colored lighting, sound system components, and the other trappings arrived during the final days. Ennui and Dementia spent most of their time assigning locations and arranging the trappings.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Darien and Dementia put the last pieces in place just before the time scheduled for first opening. The results were more than they had hoped for. In a crazy symphony of sights and subliminal sounds they had successfully melded an early victorian brothel and a mad scientist facility into a unified theme.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Back stage five very nervous musicians waited for Dementia to say a few opening words to the first of the patrons and then announce the band. True to her word Nightshade was almost unrecognizable in a pink wife beater top, black leather pants and cat morph makeup. From any distance farther than two feet she looked like an anthropomorphic cat, down to the elongated muzzle and fur. Belladonna was resplendent in a white bridal gown with neck and arm stitches. Greenish white face paint and heavy purple lipstick added to the almost dead look. Her blonde hair was left in tangles and dreads. Nausea had her curly dark hair even more tangled and wild than usual. She was wearing a tight fitting pink scoop neck dress. The long skirt of it came half way down her heavy black boots. Ennui had chosen spider web stockings under a black velvet short dress with a blood red crop top and long tailed tuxedo coat. Mid calf black boots, greyish white makeup and stitch marks completed her look. Le Mort was almost disappointing in his victorian vampire clothing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia walked out onto the stage and surveyed the room. The crowd she had hoped for was not there, however the empty space wasn't either. She had hoped for a couple of hundred people to mostly fill the dance area. Instead there were forty to fifty people milling about. Quickly she welcomed them to the club and then said, "And now, it is with great pride that I present to you the Devil's Cathouse own band, Love's Bitch."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The band walked nervously out onto the stage and assumed their usual spots. After almost dropping her sticks Nightshade beat out the tempo for their first piece. They played it almost flawlessly without any sign of life. The crowd reacted with mixed enthusiasm. For the first set they played well but remained frozen in place by nervousness.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Back stage between sets Nightshade said what they were all feeling, "We look like marionettes when the puppeteers go home. Liven it up or we'll completely loose the crowd."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Grimly Ennui nodded. The others glanced at each other and shrugged. After a fifteen minute break they drew deep breaths and stepped onto the stage once more. Ennui launched into a rousing drinking song and then summoned up the image of rock stars she's seen in bad movies. swaggering as well as she could figure how she headed to the front of the stage. As she played she shouted out, "How does a bitch get a drink in this place?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Quickly a man down front reached up and handed her a beaker of beer. "Like this!" Ennui mimed drinking it and swaggered back toward Nausea and her keyboards. Slamming the last of the beer she mock slammed it onto the top keyboard like it was a bar and mimed asking for another. Nausea grinned and mimed a quick beer pull. It started to break the ice. Ennui launched herself into prancing around the stage and dancing up to Belladonna and Nausea.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Between songs she dashed into the back and emerged with a bedraggled rose which she presented to Nightshade on her way by. Nightshade grabbed it and carefully clamped her teeth around it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">During one of Belladonna's solos Ennui grabbed Nausea and danced her around the stage. As she did she mimed the hamiest pick up actions she could think of. She turned Nausea loose just in time for her next keyboard section and grabbed Bella when it began. She copied her actions once more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When Bella had to return to her guitar Ennui danced her way toward Le Mort, only to divert toward Nightshade when she saw his look. As the song crescendoed to its climax she did an exaggerated bump and grind toward Nightshade.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">By the end of the evening everyone except Le Mort had loosened up. The applause was deafening after their last song. When it didn't die back down they came out once more and played two additional songs before retiring for the night.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Darien left only a few beats of quiet before he launched into a CD that kept the general tone of the music going. As the rest of the band headed for the back Ennui strode boldly to the front of the stage and then over to the stairs down. With a jaunty grin she made her way to the bar where Mortiss was serving out drinks. She settled herself onto a stool and watched the crowd as the music continued to pound.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Nightshade caught site of Ennui's plan and followed her lead, settling onto a stool next to her. "That certainly got better. Thanks for breaking it loose."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We needed to do something."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You guys were great! How often do you think you'll play?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not sure yet. I guess often enough to keep crowds interested, but not so often as to become boring. I don't know. The band has talk about it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You two want something?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hungarian Bull's Blood for me," Ennui answered.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Nightshade scanned the special drinks board and selected Blood Wine. Mortiss walked over to the glassware apparatus and twisted several valves. Liquids flowed and mix finally emerging to partially fill an erlenmeyer flask sitting underneath. With a practiced hand he popped a stopper into it and shook the contents as he walked back to Nightshade. "Here you are."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Nightshade picked it up and sipped slowly. "Excellent, thanks. Just the right amount of hot pepper this time."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mortiss commented,"Good. Dementia and I were tweaking on it again today. Thanks for the concept."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Cathouse slowly gained popularity over time. Some of the people that came to see what it was about never went again, but enough did that the crowds grew to several hundred through the place on lost nights. As Ennui had expected it was mostly the younger crowd that would show up.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As the band became more comfortable on stage the antics got more involved. One night there was a mock wedding between the three "brides". Another night Nightshade ran amok through the band and "killed" the "brides" during the wedding. On yet another night Nightshade leapt out into the audience and carefully brought down several volunteers in simulated hunts.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Several months after opening Ennui was talking to Dementia as they were falling asleep about the band. You know, I'm getting irritated with aspects of this band."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You guys are sounding great and the theatrics are going over extremely well. What's the problem?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Le Mort. He's not getting the adoration from the women in the crowd he craves and he's been hitting on the rest of us."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not unexpected. You are all hot. From a platonic point of view of course," Dementia remarked with a large grin.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Of course," Ennui smiled back. Her grin rapidly faded as she continued, "He's just so slimy. God, yuck! Not someone I'd want to go to bed with. I don't know Audrey's story, but the other two have each other and aren't interested in men at all."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Audrey? Oh, right, Nightshade. In that makeup I forget she's our beer connection during the day."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui continued her rant, "Plus he's just not very good. I mean we all weren't that good to start, but he can't keep up with the places we want to go. And he freaks at the antics. I've lost count of how many times he's whined back stage about our ridiculous behavior and how we are 'ruining our image'. As if being a goth band at a place called the Devil's Cathouse is a reason to lodge sticks up our asses. This isn't like playing the Grand Opera House or something."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Can't go where you want to go musically? I think you're doing fine."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, we're belting it out and getting the dance beats and all so the crowd is happy. We just want to try some different beats and maybe some stuff with more dynamics and musical interest. Le Mort can't handle the rhythms and he has one singing style, full out."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He'll probably leave on his own if you keep going. It seems like his issue with the stage fun will drive him out if nothing else does. Although then you have the problem of replacing him."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, that's what we've kind of decided. It's just frustrating us because we have to table some interesting things."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You can always do a set where he's back stage or you can come in on another night as a different group, just the four of you. I could set that up pretty easily."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It might come to that. Right now I don't think I want to push it that hard."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, ok...let me know if you want me to open up another night. You still wound up from practice tonight or you ready to try and sleep?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Guess I can sleep now. Thanks for letting me rant a bit."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No problem, it's one thing a friend is for. 'Night."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui woke to a violent kick as Dementia launched herself out of bed. She raced to her dresser and began pawing thorough the drawers. "Dementia, what is it? What are you looking for?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The com. I need the com from Merris. Quickly. We must warn her...vision, death..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui scrambled across the bed and pulled open the top draw on a woven wicker night stand. She hauled out the com unit and called, "Here it is."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia rushed back, grabbed the com, and pressed the call command. "Merris," came the clipped reply.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Team on the flooded world. There will be an incursion. From above, aquatics. Targeting lead submersible." Dementia frowned in concentration, "Wait, more...they want thing, item, technology. Large, boxy, big wires around it. Must not get...could get to us..." Dementia's voice faded as she passed out onto the bed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dementia? Dementia?" Merris called from the com.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui picked it up and spoke, "That's all. She passed out."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"DAMN!" Merris hissed. "Ennui?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Tell her I'll try. I'll tell Bart to have Allen stand by in case she needs to go there. Her train will be at Central Station if she needs it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'll tell her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia stirred slowly a few minutes later, "Did I get her the warning in time?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think so. Does that woman ever sleep?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I've heard she does, but I couldn't say. Every time I've dealt with Portal Station she's been awake."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She says your train will be at Central Station if the visions need you to go."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The com buzzed, stopping Dementia from continuing. Ennui gave it a puzzled look and switched it back on. "Yes?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui, good," Merris's voice came through the connection. "I need to ask Dementia to do something for me. Is she awake yet?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui looked questioningly at Dementia and mouthed, "Are you awake yet?" Dementia shrugged slightly and nodded. "Yes she is, Merris."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Merris, to what do I owe this?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dementia, you are one of the best for picking up new recruits. I have another one. He showed up once I sent your warning to Archinault One. Same world as Ennui, different place though. He will die doing a stupid stunt to impress a girl. Allen will have the location details by the time you reach your train if you accept. Transit time will be a day and a half each way. I can't get you anything shorter because of the Archinault One routings."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia paused for several moments before reluctantly agreeing. "Thanks Dementia. I'm glad I have you available."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia was about to cut the connection when she thought to add, "I'm staying at a place that's on the old city loop. You could tell Allen to meet me at the Devil's Cathouse. He knows where that is."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Devil's Cathouse? I've heard of it. A couple of my people have been there. I'll tell him."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia shut down the com and turned to Ennui. "She's glad she has me. She'd find someone else pretty quickly if she had to."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What's that supposed to mean?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Merris knows I am good at bringing in new recruits. She says I'm a calming influence, so she wants me to go and get another one. Do you think the guys can handle the club for a few days? Transit time will be over a day and I really don't need nightmares..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui pretended to think to cover her concern. "I think they can. When do we leave?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"As soon as Allen gets the train to our platform. I told her to send him here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How long we looking at?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Merris is listing transit time as one and a half days each way."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'll grab some things. Meet you at Darien's room?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok." They quickly grabbed items from their rooms and met outside Darien's door. After several minutes of pounding he stuck a sleep fuzzy head out and blinked sleepily at them. "What? What do you want? Need sleep..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We are needed on a mission. You and Mortiss need to take care of the Cathouse for a few days."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Days? What's this days?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Days, as in several," Ennui explained slowly. "Probably no more than three. You know the drill and the suppliers do too. You can get a message to us, can't they Dementia?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah. You get on the com to Central Station and they can get a message through. See you guys in a few days." Dementia and Ennui headed down the stairs and out the back. They had a few minutes before Allen rolled up with their train. Once aboard they stowed their gear and headed out.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">A day and a half later the com chimed with the arrival message from Allen. Soon they were racing across a large body of water toward a high red bridge. Ennui stared at it for a moment, having never seen the Golden Gate bridge from the bay before. As they watched a small figure leapt from one of the towers and plummeted toward the bay. A small para-sail opened above it but it was too little too late. Still travelling way too fast the figure slammed into the water.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> Allen was already slowing and positioning the carriage for the best angle. Dementia grabbed a headset com from the same drawer as the main unit and headed for the back platform. Ennui followed close on her heels. A trick of current brought the floating figure up closer to Ennui than Dementia and she reached down to pull it aboard. A clawed hand stabbed upward from beside the body and drove a long knife deep into her chest. Ennui gave a muffled grunt as air was driven out of her lungs from the impact. Tissues locked around the knife as the hand tried to pull the knife back out. Instead Ennui lost her grip and was dragged face first into the water. Shock kept the pain at bay long enough for her to flail about and knock the hand off the knife hilt.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Almost instantly Dementia grabbed at her ankles to keep her from drifting away. The clawed hand swiped again, drawing a deep gash across Dementia's forearm. Hissing with pain she tugged her friend back onto the car platform and looked around for the recruit. The figure was slowly drifting away, still face down in the water.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Allen, quick, I need another pass. Something is fighting us for the target." Slowly the train turned and headed back around. Just as Dementia was almost in position a long, scaled, almost humanoid body flopped up onto the target and pushed it away with the flick of heavily finned feet. Again Dementia called for another pass and again the aquatic thing pushed the target out of reach. Ennui struggled to move as she head Dementia cursing. With a bitten off scream she rolled up enough to see what was happening. Concentrating through encroaching blackness she managed a weak burst of energy and then she passed into unconsciousness. The energy splashed against the scaly figure with enough force to distract it, giving Dementia enough time to finally pull the target figure aboard.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Allen, I need help back here, fast. Ennui's hurt and our rescue is too."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"On my way. Are things stable enough that we can get out of here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Be careful. All of us are still on the back platform and I'm not able to hold onto them if they start to slip."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Jeff will get us out of here. I'm on my way." The train began a slow climb off the bay and back into the void.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When Allen arrived he found Dementia cradling Ennui in her lap and holding a torn piece of cloth against the blood oozing around the knife blade. The rescue was still face down on the platform where she had dragged him. "Help me get Ennui into the bedroom. We can put him in the tub. He should be out for a little bit yet. That was quite the system shock he took when he hit." Carefully they lifted Ennui and carried her to the bed. Dementia hesitated and finally turned back to the door. "I'll be right back," she said over her shoulder.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They carried the other figure to the bathroom and settled him into the tub. Dementia started running a warm bath. "Allen, could you watch this for a few minutes? I need to try and help Ennui."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Jeff has some medical skill, I'll go and send him back. I'll see if Merris can get us a faster routing as well. Keep the com on and I'll let you know how it goes."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later Jeff walked into the room with a large first aid kit in one hand. He took a close look at Ennui and said, "Not much we can do here. We can stabilize the knife to keep the bleeding down, but that's about it. How's the recruit?" While he was talking he was pulling out bandages and carefully immobilizing the knife.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"In a warm tub. I don't know if you saw or not but he took a long fall off the bridge. I suspect he'll be in soul shock for a while longer. You could take a look if you don't mind though."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later Jeff poked his head in and said, "I think in a couple hours he'll start to wake up. Do you want me to stay and watch him so you can stay with her?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia looked at Ennui for a long time before replying, "Yes, I would like that"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jeff looked at the unconscious girl, silently giving her a twenty-five percent chance of surviving. "I will." He started out of the room. "I'm not very good with the awakening ones. Can we swap for the first part of it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I guess..." Dementia replied uncertainly. "Sure, come get me when he starts to move. But could you be ready to keep an eye on him once he's more stable?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok. There's not much you can do to help her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know," slow tears leaked from the corners of her eyes. "But I feel better being near her." Jeff nodded and returned to the bathroom.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Allen's voice called through the com she was wearing as she walked toward the bed. "Dementia?" She replied and he continued, "I contacted Merris. The best she can do is an eighteen hour transit. She's routing us through some contested territories, however they've been quiet for a while. She thinks we should be ok."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Tell her thanks and I owe her another one."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Moving as carefully as she could she eased herself onto the bed and close to Ennui. She reached out a shaky hand and gently stroked her hair. "I'm sorry. I know you wouldn't like this if you were awake, but it makes me feel better." As she continued to stroke Ennui's hair she slowly drifted into a half sleeping state. She didn't notice the slow leak of energy from her through the contact, however it was enough to ease her down into a deep dreamless sleep. Her head fell back and rolled into a decorative notch in the headboard.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The energy flowing into Ennui stimulated regrowth of her damaged tissues. As the minutes stretched on the growth gently but firmly started to inch the knife up in the slowly closing wound. Dementia slept on as the healing continued to draw energy from her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dementia," Jeff called from the door. "Time to wake up. The recruit is awakening."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia mumbled some inarticulate reply and rolled off the bed. She stumbled to the door shaking her head to try and wake up along the way. She staggered into the bathroom and quickly splashed water on her face before turning to the tub. Jeff lounged in the doorway. Dementia was about to send him back to watch Ennui when a moan from the bath tub grabbed her attention. Quickly she focused in on the figure as it moaned again. The recruit was a young man, probably in his mid to late twenties. He was dressed in cargo pants and a button down shirt. The remnants of his parasail harness wrapped around him as well. Blue eyes opened in the ruggedly handsome face and stared sightlessly at the room around him. Slowly they focused on Dementia and his voice croaked out, "Where?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"In a warm bath. You had a bit of an accident and I rescued you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Accident? Oh, yeah, the paragliding...how did I do? Did I make it across the bay?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No. It was rather less than that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, how far then?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Face first into the bay I believe."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I wouldn't have survived that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm afraid you didn't. I am here to take you to your destination."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Are you an angel? You're dressed kind of funny to be an angel." The figure in the bath asked. Jeff snickered from the doorway.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shut up Jeff! Maybe you should go watch Ennui."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He settled into a sitting posture in the hallway. "No, I think I'll stay here for now. Just in case..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui? Is that another angel?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's a bit more complicated than that. You have a choice to make and I'm here to try and explain it to you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh gods, but I didn't mean to hurt anyone with that..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, not that kind of choice really. You have the choice between the afterlife or adventure as a recruit of the Death City Metropolitan Railroad."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Way to go Dementia, confuse the poor guy."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Listen Jeff, I'm a bit distracted, ok?" She turned her attention back to the figure in the tub, "Sorry about that, now where were we?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Weren't you about to explain why someone named Dementia is trying to convince me that I'm dead and being offered a choice of after death experiences? Cause, you know, this is starting to sound more like a gag than a real thing, although I do vaguely remember hitting the water awfully hard."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you very much Jeff. That part is a long story. You on the other hand have a choice that needs to be made. Yes, I am called Dementia. You are on a train of the Death City Metro. If you can sit up and lean over to the window it will be quite obvious that you aren't in the Realms any more."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The man leaned up and pulled aside the curtains. He gave a startled gasp then said, "Very nice effects. Spared no expense I see. Although windows are easy."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I've seen enough movies to recognize special effects when I see them."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Special effects? No, this is not special effects. Can you stand yet? If so, come with me...what IS your name anyway?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm Erick. Dementia, Ennui, and Jeff. Well, that's pretty clever. What's the matter Jeff? Couldn't think of a good goth name?" Erick slowly stood, wavering quite a bit as the blood flowed back into his legs. "Whoa, stood up a little fast there."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Nope, I just like my name."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok Erick, follow me." Dementia said as she headed for the door. She turned left and took him to the back platform first. He stepped out onto the platform and took in the stars above. Then his eyes were drawn to the stars beside and under them between the sleepers for the rails. Wind whipped around the back and played in Dementia's hair. The noise of track and locomotive throbbed around them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This is impressive! Who's paying for this? This is a hell of a gag. I didn't expect a birthday this nice until my thirtieth..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shit. We are NOT playing with you!" Dementia replied in exasperation. "Ok, I'll show you the rest of the train." She took him the other direction up the passage, carefully keeping his attention from the bedroom as they passed. At the end of the passage she took him through the connecting door and into the stares wagon. From there she took him forward to the locomotive connect. "We could go all the way forward, but it is dangerous while we are under way." The wind whipped around them as they stormed through the void.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, maybe I'm starting to believe you. What's the deal then?" Erick shouted back over the wind. "And how can there be stars and wind and air?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Magic, how else?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So what happens if I step off?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You aren't able to. If you could, you'd die the final death. No afterlife, no anything, just end of existence. Which brings me back to your choice. You can go on to the afterlife and whatever you believe it will be, or you can sign on with Death City." She gave a self mocking laugh, "I don't know why they send me to do this. I am supposed to convince you to join up, but what can I offer? Either you go to the reward you believe you are getting or you join us and face more risk. If you die in Death City it is the final death."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, yeah, I'll think about it. When do I have to decide?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Before you die doing something for Death City. I think it might be like life in the Realms, you can technically decide right up until you die, although there are some proxy gods that would hold it against you if you spent too much time working with us. We are looked upon with suspicion by both the 'good' side and the 'bad' side. We refuse to play their games of using beings in the Realms to fight their battles for them."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So if the deity I worshipped didn't like my being here it would effect my chances on leaving?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's it. The longer you are here, the more likely it is. Some sales pitch isn't it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well I wasn't ready to be bored so I think I'll give it a try. When does the excitement start?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia laughed, "Not for a little while. We came out to get you. Now we're headed back."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But you'll be there to show me around, right?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Probably not me. Jeff might though. It kind of depends on what you want to do. Now that you've sort of decided to stay you can start thinking of what you like doing."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, I like..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You don't need to tell me now. You don't ever have to tell me. You just need to think about it for yourself. Now I'm going to take you to a compartment where you are going to change out of those wet things and get some sleep. You will need it after all you've been through." Dementia took Erick back into to the drivers' coach where there was a spare compartment. In the small closet were a variety of loose fitting clothes from which he could choose. "Now try and rest. It's recommended that you remain fairly inactive for at least eight hours after a traumatic ending. Someone will see you then."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia closed the door behind her and headed back to her room. She passed Jeff on the way. "Any change?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, but none for the worse either. I think she has an ok chance of making it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia entered her room, closed and locked the door, then slipped back onto the bed and curled up protectively next to Ennui. Carefully she draped a protective arm over her as sleep claimed her. The next hours passed in quiet as the train drove on through the void.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">As the next ten hours passed so did the healing taking place with Ennui. By the time a knock came at the door the knife had pushed up out of Ennui's chest about half of its length.When the knocking turned into loud thumping Dementia began to stir. She awoke as though from exhaustion. Her head pounded almost like she had a bad hang-over as she rolled out of bed. She landed hard on her knees and hands. She pushed herself erect with a harsh curse and staggered to the door. "What?!?" she barked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's me, Erick. I woke up. What happens next?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You leave me the fuck alone?" Dementia screamed silently to herself. "You go into the kitchen and find yourself food. There should be something you might like. I'll join you later. It's been a hard night and I need more sleep. Go wake one of the boys if you need to talk." Still grumbling to herself she stumbled back to bed and collapsed onto it. Her motions brought a soft moan from Ennui. "Shhh, I'm sorry dear one. Rest, rest and heal..." Ennui moaned more softly and edged closer to Dementia. Dementia smiled to herself as she wrapped herself around Ennui once more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick walked back up the hall to the kitchen and took a quick look around. Pulling out the coffee pot he made himself some and the settled in to drink a cup. He leaned back in the chair and contemplated the last hours. He had gone to the bridge on a dare. It had seemed like a good one at the time. All he had to do was parasail from the top of the bridge. Ellaine, the woman in the bar, had even had keys to the secure areas. She had copied them from an ex-boyfriend, one that had worked for the maintenance department. Only too late had he found out that maybe it wasn't an ex after all. He had shown up at the bridge with a parasail at the time they had agreed on and there was Ellaine and a large and wide man named Andy. Andy had just grinned at him and opened the access door to the tower. "Have fun, dooood." He even made the comment sound demeaning.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">'I'll show him," Erick had thought as he climbed the ladders to the top of the Structure. Quickly he adjusted the harness and prepared to jump. Once he was in the air he realized he wasn't going to have quite enough air for full deployment of his chute. Popping it as early as he dared he hoped he'd get enough. When he felt the smashing blow of the water he knew he hadn't. "Still, it could have worked," he mumbled to himself. He poured himself another cup of coffee and stepped out into the corridor. He made his way back to the other car and knocked on the only closed door. "Hello?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes?" came Allen's sleepy voice.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Can I talk to you for a few minutes?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Who, oh, yeah...sure...just a minute." A few minutes later a sleepy looking Allen opened the door. "None for me?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Huh?" Allen waved at the coffee mug in Erick's hand. "Oh, sorry man..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, ok...guess I can get my own. What you need?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, I, well, I don't know exactly... Dementia told me some things about this Eternia place we're going and I guess I want to know more."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Come on in, disregard the mess," Allen waved at the stack of clothes tossed on the floor. "I've been out on more runs lately than usual so I haven't had time to do laundry." He pushed a stack off the only chair in the room and motioned Erick to it as he sat back on the bed. "So, ask away. No guaranteed answers though."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What's it all about? She said something about it not being liked by the other gods. I guess that's the first question, other gods? I was taught there's only one."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well, sorry but that's not the way it really works. Each one claims to be the only one."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok-ay...leaving that aside for now...what is the purpose of all this?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's easier. Every living thing has at least one deity, god, godling, etc. to take care of it when it's time ends. What about the non-living things? What about art, science, music, sculpture? All the beauty that sentience can create? That's what Eternia is about. We recover the items left behind when disaster strikes. We then slide it back into other areas of the Realms so it can be enjoyed again. Have you ever wandered the aisles of a junk shop and found the perfect treasure? Chances are we put it there."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So that's the deal then? You go around picking up things? Doesn't sound very hard, or exciting for that matter..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, 'we go around picking up things' like you said. Only the proxy gods don't want us picking up things. They don't like our refusal to play their game either. Some of them try to block our actions and in recent times they've started to get violent about it. You missed the attacks on Dementia and Ennui because you were still in death shock. Ennui has a knife in her chest and not very good odds of surviving."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No one told me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not surprised. We're still surprised at how much more dangerous things have gotten recently. It used to be the others would try and obscure details or fake us out in some way, but only recently have they launched actual attacks."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You keep saying proxy gods..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Because they don't fight their own battles. They set up belief structures and then have their followers fight each other while they stay in Valhalla, Paradise, Archearon, Hades, or where ever and watch the results. Kind of like watching a football game where the sides can kill each other. You cheer on your team, but never actually risk yourself."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You people aren't very good at selling this are you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We're not selling anything. We offer a choice. Whether someone takes it or not is entirely up to them. There are as many reasons for accepting this as there are people in Eternia. Maybe you don't like the afterlife you've been taught to believe in, maybe you are tired of the cycle and the thought of one last adventure and then oblivion is comforting, or maybe it's some other reason. It doesn't matter, only that it is your choice. If we make it out to be something it isn't we haven't done you or us any good."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So what do we do for the rest of this trip? However long it is..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Rest, relax, think about life, the universe, everything... Whatever gets you by. There's books in Dementia's carriage if reading helps. Me, I tend to sleep when I'm not relieving Allen as driver. Dementia is probably keeping watch over her injured friend or sleeping as well. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to get a bit more rest before I relieve Jeff in just over an hour."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, no problem..." Erick walked slowly out of the compartment and back to the kitchen. He rummaged around until he found food that was interesting enough to eat and then headed back to the lounge area of Dementia's car. Soon he was deep in a book.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick looked up from his book as Allen burst into the back. "Have you talked to Dementia lately?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, why?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She didn't answer the com for our arrival." Allen turned and hurried back to the closed compartment. He knocked carefully on the door. When that didn't get any reaction he pounded on the door. When there was still no reaction he pulled out a set of keys and unlocked the door. He burst into the room to find Dementia curled up around Ennui. She barely twitched when he called her name.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Watch them," He barked at Erick as he charged out the door.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Within minutes he was back panting heavily. A thin middle aged woman with shocking white hair followed rapidly at his heals. She took a quick look at the two on the bed. Then she slowly reached her hands out and ran them slowly over the two, starting at their feet. When she reached their heads she straightened up and said, "Healing trance. Quite a deep one too." She pointed to the knife wound, "Look at the knife. You can sort of see how deep it started out. Looks like it has been pushed almost out on its own."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Allen leaned in close. "I'll be... I've never seen that before."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's uncommon even here, but not unheard of. Looks like they'll be fine. They'll probably sleep a lot more though. I wouldn't disturb them until you get to Death City." The woman turned to go. "I'll tell Merris to wait on the debriefing."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Allen took the train down to Death City and received clearance on the city loop. Two and a half hours after leaving Portal Station he braked the train to a stop at the Devil's Cathouse. Slowly he opened the door to Dementia's room and tried once more to wake them. Dementia slowly pulled herself awake. With a small look of regret she pulled her arm off Ennui and asked,"Erick awake yet?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He's been awake for quite a while now." Allen replied while stifling a grin.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How long until Portal Station?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Allen let out a small snicker. "We've passed it. You're back at the Cathouse platform. Seems you slept through the trip. You and Ennui both..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How is she?" Dementia asked frantically.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Look for yourself. You two did some sort of healing trance. She was mostly ok by the time we got to Portal Station." Dementia looked closely at Ennui and notice the knife had been pushed entirely out of her chest and was held in place only by the bandages Jeff had put in place.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui? Hey, wake up now..." She gently called. After several tries she was rewarded with a soft moan.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh wow, I had the worst dream..." She started to sit up only to see a knife hilt sticking up from a mass of bandages. "Oh shit, it wasn't a dream was it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia placed a hand on her shoulder. "No, but the good news is you have some amazing healing abilities..." Ennui looked up to see unshed tears in her friend's eyes. She found she suddenly had blink back ones of her own. "What say we head up to our own rooms. I'm sure Allen and Jeff would like a break."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm fine too thank you," Erick commented from the door of the compartment.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, sorry about that. Did you manage to talk to Allen or Jeff at all?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Allen answered some of my questions. You two were really out of it. Are you better now?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Seems so. Just still really tired."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The healer at Portal said you'd probably need to sleep some more. I'm guessing you'll need lots of food later as well. How about you call Temple Heath when you're up and we can meet at the Adam and Eve?" Allen added.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds great," Dementia managed through a huge yawn. "Could one of you find Erick a place to stay? If he doesn't mind a bit of noise we have a few finished apartments above the club." She yawned again. "Well, I'm off to sleep some more." She and Ennui slowly left the train and headed up to their rooms.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ten hours later they walked into the Adam and Eve and descended to the basement hall where the Temple Heath crowd usually congregated. Allen waved them over and made room near him for them to squeeze in. Jo flitted over and set large glasses of water in front of them. "Finish these and then I'll let you order something else. Now, what sort of food would you like? We have the usual, plus super burgers, prepared specially for the survivors of healing trances."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia stared hard at Allen. "Did you tell everyone?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Only the people who would have asked."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They both ordered the super burgers and sat back sipping water. The rapid arrival of food allowed them to not have to answer an immediate flurry of questions. Once they were finished however the table prompted for a recounting of the entire incident.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Many hours later they staggered back toward the Cathouse, relatively drunk but happy. At the club Ennui said, "I think I'm going to dance a little before bed tonight. I've been lazing about too much the past few days." She headed down to the dance floor and checked in with the bar staff before making her way into the dancing throng. Dementia watched from the upper floor for several minutes before following her down.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia danced her way to a spot where she could see Ennui near the stage. She didn't notice that Erick had danced up beside her until he touched her arm and spoke, "How you doing?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She twitched at the unexpected contact and glared back. "Fine."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And Ennui? How is she?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She's fine too." She started to ignore him, then realized how rude that really was and asked, "How are you doing? Did you find a place?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm in one of your apartments, one of the ones on the second floor. It's nice. Thanks for offering it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not a problem. Drink?" she asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure." They eased their way out of the crowd and to a couple of stools near the dance floor bar. Erick stared at the bar apparatus. "Fancy glassware. Did you design it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, a friend of our beer supplier did. I'm quite happy about it though." She waved Darien over. "Darien, this is Erick. He's upstairs at least temporarily. Erick, what would you like?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A lighter beer please."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"One beer and one blood wine coming up." Darien started a beer pour and then stepped to the apparatus. Swiftly he turned a variety of knobs and liquids began to flow. The device bubbled and churned as dark red liquid flowed into the flask set aside for it. Darien stopped the device, ended the beer pour, shoved a stopper into the flask and shook it while delivering the beer to Erick.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Blood wine?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's a specialty drink. I like it because it's got hot pepper sauce in it and it looks like thin blood. Plus it's a great way to watch the drink apparatus in action."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"As far as the apartment goes you can either stay in it or find something you like better. I'm sure Allen explained a lot of this to you today, but Eternia is mostly a form of barter economy. We all do the things we like and are good at. Then we share the results to benefit the rest."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He explained some of that. He didn't say what happened if you got someone who didn't fit in though..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Are you worried about that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, just curious."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It doesn't happen very often. Whatever selection mechanism the Lady uses keeps it from happening in the first place. I have seen it once though. What happened was the person tried to not do anything. It worked, although they became more and more uneasy and uncomfortable. Some small spark of conscience, for lack of a better term, started to bother them. Eventually the went off on a mission and got themselves killed. It was rather sad actually. Here was a chance to heal from the nastiness of the Realms but they couldn't quite accept it." Dementia noticed Erick seemed a bit uneasy at the thought but she chose not to push against it. She glanced back at the dance floor and noticed Ennui heading up the back steps. She forced up a yawn and said, "I'm starting to get sleepy again, so I shall be saying good night now." She stood to leave.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So am I. Let me follow you as far as my apartment." Erick rose and followed her up.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He started to speak once they had passed out of the club and into the quieter corridors. Not wanting to talk more Dementia called up a large yawn again and said, "Sorry, but I don't think I could follow any more conversation tonight." She left him at the door to his apartment.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In her rooms she slipped into her night wear and waited for Ennui to join her. Once they were in bed she mentioned, "I think Erick was hitting on me tonight."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think Erick's been hitting on you every time he sees you," Ennui observed. "He isn't un-attractive..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know, but just as you don't swing my way, he isn't the type of guy I find attractive. He's too, I don't know, full of himself maybe?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, I know the type. They'd hose the floors down with testosterone given half a chance. Still, he is nicer than most of the guys I've dealt with. He at least seems to think we aren't lesser for being women."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That is a good sign, you're right."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You won't let me stop you from finding a relationship, will you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, no...it's just the nightmares spook me a little..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I know the feeling. I wonder if it's a sleeping alone thing or a sleeping without each other thing..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I haven't a clue. How about we worry about it when one of us finds someone we're interested in? I think I'm still tired from the healing trance."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good night, Dementia."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sleep well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The next night Ennui was tending the dance floor bar when Erick plopped down on a stool. "Hi Ennui. Something strong ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, what kind of strong? Paralyzingly sweet, sweet, neutral, or harsh?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't care, just strong. Uh 151 rum and diet coke maybe."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Coming up." Ennui set a glass down in front of him a few minutes later.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Before you go, can I ask you something?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm the bartender, of course..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What type of guys does Dementia like?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You should maybe be asking her that don't you think?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not yet. I don't think she likes me. She won't talk to me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Erick, the couple of times you've tried she has been exhausted or injured. What do you expect? Give her a couple of days to get back on her feet and try talking then."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Point taken. But still, what kind of guys does she tend to go out with? Is she seeing anyone right now? I know you're one of her best friends. It's pretty obvious."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And as her best friend it's not my place to tell stories about her. That's for her to do."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The least you can do is tell me if she's seeing anyone. I could find that out from anyone."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, I can tell you she's not seeing anyone right now. Satisfied?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, but if that's as good as I can get..." He started hopefully.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It is."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Then it'll have to do. Can you tell me what she likes?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What she likes?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, does she like to read? Go for walks, stuff like that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Erick..." Ennui replied in exasperation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know, ask her yourself..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Very good. Now, do you need a refill on that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think so, only less coke this time."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui slowly climbed the steps to her rooms after the Cathouse closed, thinking all the while about Erick's questions. As she slid in beside Dementia she asked, "What do you like?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hmm?" Dementia mumbled through a yawn.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know you aren't crazy about hard physical work, but you'll do it for a goal. You have terrible visions and nightmares sometimes. I realized today that I don't know much about what you like."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Goes the same for you," Dementia responded sleepily.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I guess it does at that," Ennui was about to continue when she heard Dementia's breathing had slipped into sleep. Not wanting to wake her she settled back and stared up at the ceiling, mumbling to herself, "I think I need to get to know you better..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The morning dawned bright and beautiful. Ennui awoke first and stumbled to the kitchen. While a fresh pot of coffee brewed she slipped into the shower. She was just drying her hair when Dementia staggered into the kitchen. "Coffee, mmmm. Have I told you how much I appreciate that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You do? Good." Ennui smiled at her. "So that's one of the things you like? Fresh coffee in the morning?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well duh," Dementia answered with a smile of her own. "As far as I can tell you do as well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Especially after a hot shower, yes. How about foods? I know we go to the Adam and Eve for breakfasts a lot, but is it just because it's close or because you like the food as well?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It is close, but I like the food. I'm kind of a sucker for breakfast food. I could eat it most any time. How about you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Burgers, definitely. Something about the seared meat taste just does it for me. I have a thought. How about we just take a lazy day before the club opens and do some of your favorite things?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What is this, get to know Dementia day?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And would there be something wrong with that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I guess not. Just wait until it's your turn though..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Breakfast then? What would you like to do after that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Breakfast it is and then how about a walk along the river?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds great!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As they walked along the river Dementia finally asked, "This is great and all and I'm having a great time so far, I'm just a bit curious as to why, you know, to find out about me?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We are room mates, we work at the same club, we spend a lot of time together, I just thought maybe we should know a bit more about each other..." Ennui replied guiltily. "We don't have to do this..." Ennui turned her head away to hide the beginnings of tears.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shhh, hey, I never said I wanted to stop. I was just curious, that's all..." Dementia reached out and pulled Ennui into a quick hug. "I'm not so great at this I guess. I've been here quite some time but there are still things from the past that haunt me. And I'm afraid of you a little. I know you aren't interested in me the way I'd like, but I, well, I am having trouble not falling for you anyway. So some of my distance is because of that." Dementia gave a shaky little laugh, "So, I like long walks along the river, Warm fall days and kicking through fallen leaves. Purring cats, dancing to anything with a good beat, train rides, without the visions please, and breakfast foods. Now it's your turn."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Walks on sunny days, the sounds of falling or moving water, candle-lit dinners, warm starry nights where you can lay out on a roof or a grassy patch and stare up at them, dark, brooding music and strange hair colors. Playing bass at the club, and grilled meats of most kinds. And you as my friend. Speaking of falling for someone, I have to tell you I think Erick has the hots for you. Just so you know he'll probably put the moves on in the next few days. He kept trying to get me to talk about you the other night. I kept telling him if he wanted to know about you that he had to ask you. He might have gotten the message by the end of the evening..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Great. It's happened before. Usually when I recruit a guy I spend the next few weeks convincing them that I'm not their long lost love."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you do it then? If I might ask..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's sort of on my list of likes in a perverse kind of way. I like to watch people realize that the afterlife isn't this cut and dried thing. So many of them come in with terror of the afterlife promised by bad religious upbringing. It makes me feel good to give them hope again."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, guess I hadn't thought about it that way. My upbringing was thankfully free of that baggage, but I knew quite a few people where I ended up that weren't so lucky."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I mentioned coming from Victorian London, well there was quite a bit of it there. If you came from a working class background it was both more and less important than if you were of the upper classes. Some things were set aside to survive. I was lucky and found work in a theatre. Many of the people I knew had to work the streets to get by. It was a very harsh time if you weren't wealthy."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I wonder if that's a kind of theme? I grew up with the circus. It's one of those things most people don't believe, but I did. My mom ran away from home when she was eighteen with a lion trainer with the circus. He wasn't very good either as a partner or as a tamer and was let go shortly before I was born. My mom kept me and I was raised for the first twelve years of my life as one of the circus kids. We travelled on the train with the show and had teachers and school and all that. We also learned any circus arts we desired. I was studying with the acrobats. It was a wonderful life for me, however my mom didn't handle it very well. She was one of the support crew. She went in and handled load in and load out logistics. She was really good, but she didn't think so. Slowly she fell into a depression and when we were near her childhood home she quit. We lived in a shitty little apartment for a while and then she met my step father. He's nice enough, just rather set in his ways. He never understood the draw of the circus life and couldn't understand why I had such a hard time settling down."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What was the hardest part?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"When they put me in the local schools. The kids were horribly clannish and narrow minded. Most of them had enough local intolerance that they thought the circus was for people who couldn't make it in the real world. I still don't understand that one. The circus provided entertainment and escape and people flocked to it. You had to be top of your game to get in and stay in. It didn't matter to them. I was an average student and only really excelled at gymnastics. Anyway, I survived it and went off to university. Life was much better there. Universities tend to attract more of a diverse crowd. It wasn't quite so clannish either so I managed to better in classes. I was happier and my parents were too. I miss them sometimes. Mostly I miss my little sister. She was technically my step sister but we got to be quite close. She could tell me the things our parents wouldn't understand, like how she knew she was lesbian when she was twelve. I hope she's ok."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds like your parents weren't that bad."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, I'm sure she'll figure it out. She's smarter than I am and has one of those quiet but takes no shit kinds of personalities."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, I didn't mean to bring you down..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok. Guess I still think about it sometimes. This place is so...I don't know...I guess it has all the best aspects of the circus, without the high ego and ass hole factor."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There's not total immunity from that here either."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'll believe you, it just seems quite reduced from what I've seen."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It is."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Do you miss the theatre at all?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Some, yeah. It had the same sense of belonging that there is here. It was so long ago that it's faded quite a bit in my memory though."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, we don't seem to be doing as well for favorite things.  Are there other things? Maybe things you do to relax?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well..." Dementia smiled seductively.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui blushed bright red and hastily added, "Besides that..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You'd be surprised how few people actually think of that one..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure, still anything else?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Spoil sport."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just don't want to lead you on to things that might not happen."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Might not? Hmmm..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dementia!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, ok, let's see...I like movies and books. Curling up with a favorite one of either can be good, especially on the rainy days. The Hall of Records project was kind of an extension of that and gave me something to occupy me when I was here. Now the club gives me something else to do and I find I really like doing it. It's a great chance to talk to some really interesting people. I hadn't thought there were so many that would be interested in what we created. And you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Books are good. So is figuring new things out on bass guitar. I agree the club is a grand thing. It turned out better than I could have hoped! Is this how new recruits figure out what they want to do?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Usually. Often it's through talking about it with the people around you." She screamed and clutched her head, dropping to the ground in a boneless heap. "Com..." Her hands fumbled uselessly at her sides.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui reached into the small bag Dementia carried it in and pulled it out. She snapped it on and waited for Merris to answer. As soon as she did Ennui leaned close to Dementia and asked,"What are you seeing?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Route Alpha Gamma three six... trap, magic, counter protections, open to void..." Merris and Ennui kept the com open when Dementia stopped speaking in case there was more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As soon as Dementia passed completely into unconsciousness Ennui spoke into the com, "Looks like that's it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks, I'll keep you posted." Ennui switched the com to standby and placed it back in the bag. Gently she pulled Dementia into her arms and held her until she stirred. She brushed Dementia's hair back and asked softly, "So what did you do before you had someone to watch over you when you collapse?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Fell down and woke up when it was over," Dementia whispered hoarsely. She remained in Ennui's arms until she could move again. As she stood she commented slowly, "They've been getting worse lately. More of them and more debilitating when they come. Used to be I'd just sit and stare into space, now...well you've seen..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Is there anything more we can do? Something to track down the threat or something? It seems like it's just a matter of time before the warning isn't quite soon enough..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia stared at the ground with an expression of sorrow and fear, "I know. If only I could get the visions sooner, or with more detail, or just stay conscious long enough to state them clearly."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That wasn't what I meant."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know, it's just I've thought the same thing and every time I can't think of anything else to do. Oh god, I just wish there was!" Dementia wailed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This isn't your fault. Just like the Lady told me, it's just where you are at the time." Ennui wrapped a steadying arm around her and they started slowly back toward the Cathouse.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I've seen a bit more. There are changes coming. We will be drawn into a battle with the proxy gods for our survival. They want something we have."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Did you see all that?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, it's just pieces of feeling from the last few visions. But it seems right given the increasing attacks."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You want me to handle the club tonight? Let you take it easy?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Much as I'd like that, I think I need the distraction of the crowd."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Okaaaay, just be ready in case Erick shows up."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not to worry friend of mine, I've dealt with this before. Although I'm going to laugh it up when you get your first one..." Dementia finished with a laugh.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was getting quite late at the Cathouse when Erick made his way to the main bar. He sat down and waited for Dementia to notice him. Once he had his drink he stared into it nervously before flagging her down again. "I, uh, how's it been going?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Fine, Erick. You more settled in now? Found something to keep you busy yet?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm helping prepare coaches for the rescue missions and then helping with unloading and cataloging at the central repository."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Great!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Can I ask you something?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You can ask. Sometimes I even answer."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Are you seeing anyone?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Kind of personal, but I can answer that. No, I'm not seeing anyone right now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Would you like to go out tomorrow night?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The direct approach, takes courage," Dementia stated. "I don't want to hurt you..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But direct doesn't work..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Erick, I'm not currently looking for a partner. I'm sorry. I'm not the right person. Stick with direct though, honesty is always appreciated here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick bit back the hurt words that sprang into his mind and forced out, "Is there a way we could be friends?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I would very much like that. Friends would be a very nice thing. It's hard to have too many."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I, I think I'd like that as well. I gotta get some sleep, see you later..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia sighed as she headed for the back. "Mortiss, I'm taking a break. I'll send Delirium out to help you." In the kitchen she waved to Delirium and motioned for her to come over. "Could you help Mortiss for a bit? I need to take a break."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure boss." The tall, lanky, shaved headed woman pulled a dark brown robe over her tights and danskin top. "The monk is on duty."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You doing ok boss? You look a little spooked."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Naw, I'm ok, just a new recruit crush in action out there."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Delirium nodded knowingly, "Yeah, happens almost every time. Good luck!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He was nice enough. I don't think it'll get too uncomfortable."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia headed out of the kitchen, through the storage areas, and out onto the back platform. She stared up at the stars, not seeing Ennui sitting on a crate further along. She jumped when Ennui spoke, "Beautiful night isn't it? I love the stars here. There are so many of them."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, you got me..." Ennui couldn't help the laugh that bubbled out of her as Dementia tried to clarify, "Uh, you know what I mean, you startled me, sitting in the shadows like that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry,"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No you're not!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Guilty as charged. So, you doing ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, about to tell the crew to take over and head to bed. Other than that Erick did corner me, like you thought he would."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And nothing. I let him down as gently as I could while making it clear there was no chance. It hit him pretty hard, but he had stones enough to ask to be friends. I think he'll be ok."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good. He'll find the right one. Probably take him a while, but he will." Ennui turned back to the stars. "Want to sit and watch the stars for a bit or go sleep?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia settled onto a second crate. "Watch for a few minutes, then tell the crew the club is theirs for the night."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They sat in comfortable silence for half an hour. At last Dementia stood and stretched, "Got to sleep now. It would be supremely bad to fall asleep and fall off this crate." She headed back inside. "I'll tell the crew. See you upstairs?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui nodded until she remembered it was too dark to see, "I'm headed up now." She stared up at the stars a few minutes longer as thoughts swirled around in her head. With a sigh she stood and made her way to their rooms. Quickly she prepared for bed and was just settling herself when Dementia came in from the club. Soon she returned, slipped into bed, and turned out the light. Almost instantly Dementia fell asleep. Ennui lay awake staring up at the ceiling for a long time before sleep finally pulled her into its embrace.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui woke to an empty bed and the smell of fresh coffee. Slowly she stretched and slid out of bed. She padded out into the main room and caught a picture perfect view of Dementia curled up in a papasan chair with sunlight dancing off the highlights in her hair. She was reading something and sipping coffee.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After watching the tableau for a few moments Ennui padded into the kitchen for coffee of her own. She returned and settled into a chair of her own. Rather than grabbing a book she stared out the window at the river and across toward the cathedral. So lost in thought was she the at first she didn't hear Dementia calling. "Huh? Sorry, just lost in thought..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just wondering if you were ready for food yet, and if you slept well. You seemed kind of restless when I woke up once."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I slept, all that talk of our pasts did make me restless... Food would be good."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't mean to dredge all that up, your past that is..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know, just once in a while it hits me. I mean someone like Erick was dead anyway, so whatever he chose didn't matter to his survivors. I could have chosen to stay. I would probably have died of boredom, I'm not sure I would have been able to find interesting work, but I would have been able to still see my friends and sister..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's not too late to go back. It'd be hard to explain the long absence, but you could try..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No...no. I think about it sometimes, but I don't think I could... I like too many things about here to want to give it all up. I'll be ok...now about that breakfast..." Ennui finished through a half hearted grin.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Later in the afternoon Ennui headed down to the dance floor for a quick band rehearsal. She found the others already set up and ready to go. They quickly ran through a few of their newer songs before checking that everything was ready for the evening's performance. As Audrey headed out Ennui asked, "Got a few minutes?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure?" Audrey asked puzzled.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui paced a bit before asking, "Does this place change you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, usually, how do you mean?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I find I'm not thinking the same way about some things any more."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It can do that, could be just personal growth as well though. The changes we see most often are someone arrives looking the way they did in the Realms, then they slowly morph into how they see themselves. Sometimes the difference is quite amazing, sometimes you'd barely notice."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh." Ennui slumped down on a stool and leaned her head in her hands. "It just feels like so much of what I thought isn't important anymore and it's really confusing me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That happens. It does help to talk about it. You and Dementia seem to be really good friends, how about her?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I would, just..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think I can guess. It involves her in some way and you don't want to say anything until you have whatever it is sorted out a bit more..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Great guess. You got it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, you can do it that way, although sometimes things have a way of coming up before you're ready."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui gave a heavy sigh and explained, "It's just I've been telling her a couple of things about me that was true in the Realms. Now that I've been here and experienced more things I find that they aren't as true any more. I'm just not sure how not true they've become. I don't want to hurt her with them."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So, as you would say as bartender, just talk to her. Put it like that and let her decide how she wants to deal with it. One thing I would say is Eternia is a more dangerous place than the Realms. It is often best not to wait to tell someone something. You might suddenly loose the chance."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah," Ennui said slowly, unconsciously rubbing her new scar. "Thanks, see you tonight."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly she stood and made her way out onto the back platform. She took the stairs down and crossed the tracks. At the river she turned right and followed along the bank until she cam to the spill-way from the upper hills. She lay back on the grassy part of the bank and listened to the rushing of the water. After a few minutes the sun and the sounds lulled her into a light sleep.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She awoke a while later when the sun had slanted down behind the buildings on the far bank. Stiff and a bit chilled she stood up slowly. She stared into the rushing water and mumbled, "Well, that didn't help much." She walked slowly back to the Cathouse, arriving as the red light of sunset faded in the distance.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, you ok?" Dementia called from behind the bar.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, went out for a walk along the river and fell asleep on the bank. I guess I must have needed it. Now I'm stiff though." She smiled and said, "I'm going to grab a quick hot bath, get into costume, and be back down." She started to add something else but stopped at the last minute.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui returned a while later dressed in her "bride" costume for the evening performance. She wolfed down a burger from the kitchen and retired to the dressing rooms to finish her makeup.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui took over behind the dance floor bar once the band had finished for the evening. As soon as she had taken quick stock of the bar and settled into the night's routine Erick flopped down on an empty stool. "Hey, great performance tonight! I really liked some of the love song things you did. Are those new?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, we've been working on them for a while but tonight was the first time we used any of them."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Who's the drummer, she's one interesting lady. I love the cat makeup. Could you get me a blood wine when you get a chance?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Nightshade? She prefers to keep her non-stage identity to herself. Sometimes she hangs around after a performance. Tonight I think she wanted to get home." She had to hide a smile as she saw Audrey swagger down the steps from the entry level without her Nightshade makeup. She kept up the charade as Audrey stepped up to the bar and asked, "So was the band any good tonight?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I thought we played well. You'd have to ask someone else for an unbiased view though. Maybe Erick has an opinion. Erick?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I thought they were great. They did some new stuff that was excellent. Especially the drum parts."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Glad you liked it Erick. We did some new stuff tonight. It seemed well received."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good to hear. Well, time for me to get some dancing in. See you in a bit. Nice to meet you, Erick." Audrey wove her way through the crowd and onto the dance floor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not dancing tonight?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, I wanted to thank you for telling me to talk to Dementia. I was disappointed, she's not interested, but I guess it's best to know up front."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sometimes it is at that. It can save lots of misunderstandings."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So, as bartender you must get plenty of lonely people coming to you for advice. What do you tell them?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Actually, not as many as you'd think. Advice, keep your options open and don't come on too strong. Standard stuff like that. Otherwise I have a strict no interference policy. Now I'm off to get your drink." She took a moment over by the bar apparatus to roll her eyes before returning with his drink.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So you won't point out the lonely people? I could offer to pay, but it doesn't work that way here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just stop being desperate and people will like you more. You've been here what now? About four days? Let yourself settle in and decide who you are. Then look for companionship." She looked at him a moment to judge his reactions then said in mock severity, "This is not a meet market. We run a good clean family place here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once again Dementia found Ennui on the back platform as the club wound down for the night. "Hi. You still ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I am now," she mouthed silently before answering, "I'm ok. God, Erick is a walking hormone bomb. Tonight he was asking about available people I might know."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh right, something I did forget to mention, those who die to come here often have an intense period of adjustment. It has to do with how the new body works or something. I remember being miss mega-bitch for almost a month before I figured it out. As a Walker you don't have to deal with that. You may slowly change into who you think you are, but the wild hormonal and emotional things won't hit you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What sort of changes happen to Walkers?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You can expect some physical form changes if your mental self image didn't match your physical reality. Some attitude changes as the expectations of others give way to what you really believe underneath. That's mostly it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mostly?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sometimes Walkers end up being restless and unsettled. I don't think it happens every time, but it is a risk. Well, that's it for me. I'm headed up."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Me too." They walked in companionable silence to their rooms. Ennui started to speak several times but then stopped. She started to talk again once they were in bed, but stopped when she heard Dementia's breathing slide into sleep patterns. She lay there and watched her sleep for several minutes before snuggling up close and placing an arm across her friend. "Sleep well beautiful one."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui woke first in the morning and rather than hop out of bed like she had every morning before she snuggled close to Dementia and lay listening to her breath. When Dementia showed signs of waking she started to pull away, then thought of Audrey's advice and remained where she was. Sleepy brown eyes opened and looked into wide awake green ones. "Hi," Ennui breathed softly. She rolled out of bed and looked back at Dementia, "I'm going to make us some coffee, then there's some things I'd like to explain..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It took her twice as long as normal to make the coffee. Her hands shook as she measured and set it to brewing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Back in bed Dementia was trying to calm her pounding heart with deep breathing exercises. It wasn't working. By the time Ennui returned she was wound to an almost fever pitch.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui sat nervously on the end of the bed and began, "I've been thinking about the things I said when I arrived. They may have been true then, but they don't seem so very important any more." She looked down nervously before continuing, "I'm falling in love with you. I didn't mean to and I don't understand it, but I am. I know I've pushed you away pretty hard ever since arriving so I'll understand if you don't want this."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, I'd like you to fall in love with me." Dementia patted the bed near her, "You want to come back here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui scooted up and settled into the crook of Dementia's arm. She tipped her head up, stared into warm brown eyes, and kissed Dementia softly. "Mmmm, better than I could have imagined!" A long time later they sipped cooked down coffee and talked into the afternoon.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Cathouse staff immediately noticed something had changed by the open glances the two would toss between each other as they worked. Delirium grinned at Dementia when she came into the kitchen for an order and said, "About fucking time boss. The tension was so thick between you two we could have served it on desert plates."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well..." Dementia answered back, grinning like a fool. "It sure feels good now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once again Erick sat down at the bar when he saw Ennui on duty. "Hey, just thought I'd let you know I'm going out on my first mission tomorrow. I can't wait! At last, something to do."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Great. How long is it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A short one, maybe two days at most. It's to pick up some stuff that was missed by the first team in." Erick looked closely at Ennui. "You seem happy today."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yup! I figured out something that had been bothering me for quite a while. Good luck on that mission by the way."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh yeah! I am so stoked! I gotta dance some energy off. I'll be back." He practically bounced his way over to the dance floor and powered his way through several tracks. When he came back to the bar it was only for a drink and water then he was gone again.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui jumped at a touch from behind. "Hey, how's it going down here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She turned and smiled when she saw Dementia, "Hey yourself. It's going good. Our friendly new recruit is going out on a mission tomorrow. He's so excited he can barely contain himself. I'll be right back, orders to take..." She hurried through the orders and returned. "So, what you doing later? Want to go watch some stars?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'd love to. You know, there's a roof access upstairs and I just happen to have the only key..." Dementia grinned evilly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ooooh, wicked one! I'm so there!" Ennui grinned back. "We have talented help, we could skip out for the night..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now who's the evil one? I'll arrange it and send Delirium down to take over."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia practically ran upstairs. She burst into the kitchen and rapidly arranged relief for herself and Ennui. "And Delirium, could you give me ten minutes and then go relieve Ennui?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure boss. Something special planned? You know we have some of that rescued champagne, you might think about putting it to good use..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wonderful idea. I owe you..." Dementia made a quick detour to the wine cellar after grabbing an ice bucket and then headed up to her rooms. She pawed through her clothes until she found the outfit she wanted. Swiftly she slipped into the spider web black lace stockings, the low cut dress with the high cut front and low back, and hurried out onto the roof. She had just gotten settled when Ennui emerged.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia tossed the keys to Ennui who silently locked the door and left the keys in the lock. she slowly walked over to Dementia surveying her in the moonlight. As she saw what she was wearing her smile widened. She switched to a seductive slinking walk and moved slowly closer. When she finally arrived near Dementia she slowly settled onto the roof next to her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Morning found them tangled up together in bed. Neither one leapt forth to make coffee. A couple of times one would start to slip out only to spot the other and settle back in for one more kiss. It wasn't until the call of a full bladder pulled Dementia out of bed that coffee was made.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">That night when they walked into the kitchen together the rest of the club crew clapped and gave them cat calls. Delirium summed it up best with a resounding, "Way to go boss!" The news spread through the club like wild fire since both Ennui and Dementia made constant excuses to check how the other one was doing. A couple of times they were spotted slow dancing on the dance floor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Two nights later Erick flopped down at the bar again. "Wow, what a trip! There's this hot babe I just met during the mission. Her name's Audrey. I think you kind of know her, she was asking about the band a couple of nights ago? Hey and congratulations on stealing Dementia away from me. Nothing personal but I didn't think you were her type."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Erick, are you always this blunt, or is it just something in me that brings it out in you?" Ennui asked somewhat annoyed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's just you. You are a friend and I can be direct with my friends. So anyway, this mission was great! Lots of danger from unstable buildings and old security devices and such, not to mention the unexploded bombs and the like, but everyone just waded in anyway. It was such a rush! I can't wait to go out again. I wonder if Audrey is going on the next one? She was so cool, working as hard as the rest of us and all..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Do the words chauvinist pig mean anything to you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, I've known my share of white trash, I've seen movies, why?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Because...oh never mind." Ennui shook her head and left to get him a drink. By the time she returned he was bending the ear of the person on the next stool about the joys of missions.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The next day Audrey cornered Ennui after practice, "Hey, congratulations! I hear you have a new love. And she's hot besides!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, it's really cool. Thanks for your advice. It helped a lot."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Speaking of advice, do you have any about Erick? He seems to talk to you a lot when you're behind the bar."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What kind of advice?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How to get him to back off a bit? I might be interested if I didn't feel like he was some weird sort of stalker or something. Last mission I couldn't go anywhere without him being there 'helping'."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dementia found the direct approach worked best. He's nice enough, just not well socialized. Once Dementia told him to back off he pretty much did. I keep telling him to stop with the desperation and things will be better for him. I keep hoping it'll work."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'll try a combination of those ideas then, thanks."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, no problem."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Over the next few months Erick continued to go on every mission he could. Each time he would come back excited and rambling. Always he told Ennui about it. Fortunately his obsessiveness over the women around him moderated after the first month and a half. Only if Audrey was a part of the mission would he come back and try and find out more about her from Ennui. He asked Audrey out a few times, however she never agreed, always managing to find a reasonable excuse. Still he kept trying.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Cathouse continued to expand in popularity until it was routinely crowded every night, often from opening until closing. The nights when Love's Bitch would play would pack people in even more tightly. Dementia continued to have visions of disasters and each time Merris managed to get things taken care of before there was serious injury of and Erternians.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">About a year after Ennui arrived in Eternia things changed again. Once again things started out like any other mission. Erick chattered excitedly at the bar on the night before the scheduled departure. Audrey had come in to practice that day and told the rest of the band she was heading off on a three day mission. Le Mort had added he was also going along. From the bits and pieces Ennui received it sounded like a much larger mission than was typical. Two trains were scheduled and three separate teams were being gathered.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In the morning Ennui and Dementia watched as the train carrying Audrey, Le Mort, and Erick pulled out of Central Station. There was a stop scheduled for Portal Station where they would pick up the specifics on the mission itself.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The mood on the train was typical for a Death City Metro excursion. A touch of nervousness, a touch of tension, and quite a bit of enthusiasm and high spirits. Once more they were on their way to recover treasures and artifacts of great beauty and value. Erick was talking with Le Mort while casting quick glances at Audrey. Audrey was ignoring the fact Erick was watching her and instead was talking with Dennis, one of the three team leads, about what he knew about the mission. Several of the support group were going over materials and food allocations. When the train pulled into Portal Station Fritz, the mission leader, stepped off with the two other team leads to get the last of the information from Merris at Dispatch.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They returned quickly and Fritz stood up as the other two headed back into the other cars. "As you know this mission is to Delestra 6. It has recently seen major civil war. Many of its major cities and industrial centers have been destroyed. There are a few survivors, however they live in areas we are not going to be touching on today. Our mission is the university district of one of the major cities. Team one will be dealing with the Archeological center, the art center, and the engineering library. Team two will take several underground vaults from the university toward town square. Each should be accessible from the subway system. You will have cutters and excavating equipment at your disposal should you require it. Team three will take the main art museum, the primary library, and the philosophy library. The second train will remain at the university center for teams one and three to load. This train will take team two and receive the items they recover." He glanced down at a time piece on his wrist and added, "We will arrive in two hours. Team two Dennis is your team leader. Coordinate with him for assignments. Your equipment is already on board."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Fritz motioned to Dennis and they sat down next to each other. He handed a data package to Dennis and instructed, "This is the data for your recoveries. You will be working from the subway platforms and access ways. The information we have indicates they should all still be passable. If you find they aren't use your judgment. The last thing we want is for you to get stuck down there. The map is marked with the three stations with the best access to the areas you need. In each case the items we want are in the basement areas, near the stations. You'll emerge close to the center of town and should be able to take surface track back to where the rest of us are working. Questions?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Do we have an abort path?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sort of. Once you are out of the subway it's straight out through the far side of town. It's marked on the map as well. The dangerous section is the subway itself. We don't have an abort path for you from inside it. All our intelligence shows only a single path through. Anything else?" When Dennis shook his head Fritz finished, "Ok, let's do this then."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dennis walked back to the front of the passenger car and began, "Le Mort, you are good with the finders, I've assigned you lead position. Erick, you are good at reading structures, I'd like you by Le Mort to spot dangerous sections before we are into them. Everyone else we will be using standard movement order. We'll pull equipment from the stores as needed rather than burdening ourselves with it to start. Anyone have any questions?" Dennis waited a few moments then finished up, "We will stop briefly to off-load the other teams and then we are into it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The train slowed and stopped in the center of the shattered university campus. Bright yellow sun shone down from a perfectly clear sky onto the twisted wreckage of the buildings as Fritz and the other teams rapidly deployed from the train. Ten minutes after stopping the train eased forward once more and soon descended into the dark hole of the subway system.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Outside the train twisted piping, pushed aside concrete, and other debris shoved in perilously close. After an agonizing ten minutes the train slowed to a stop at the first platform. Doors were opened on the cargo cars and powerful flood lights lit the scene. Le Mort and Erick went out first and swept the platform. Once they declared it safe the rest of the team stepped out. Quickly Le Mort led the way through the subway terminal and into the target area. The first recovery was finished within an hour of arrival.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly the train crept along the subway tunnel to the next location where the process was repeated. Once again the recoveries were completed quickly. Then the train began creeping toward the final platform. When they were about three hundred meters away from the platform a deep boom echoed through the tunnel. The ground shuddered as broken concrete and dust showered down on the train. It banged and clanged off the roof leaving large dents in several locations. At last the train eased into the final station. The flood lamps one again illuminated the wreckage strewn platform. This one was far worse than the previous two. Large sections of the ceiling had crashed down leaving oddly shaped voids above. Piles of rubble created an obstacle path between the tracks and the access ways to the rest of the station. Debris spilled out of two collapsed passageways and the stairs to the surface were littered with rock and dirt.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Carefully Le Mort led the way toward the far passage which was the one indicated for best access to the target buildings. Erick was busy scanning the walls and ceiling as they went. Every so often he would place a hand on Le Mort's shoulder and hold him back while he took a closer look. Then they would move forward a bit more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They cleared the final pile of rubble on the platform after ten agonizing minutes and stopped to wait for the rest of the team. Once everyone was in position Le Mort eased his way into the passage. He had gone five feet when an explosion ripped through the right wall and shredded him with flying debris. Erick dove face down on the floor as black balls of energy crackled through the newly formed opening. Frantically Audrey dragged him back out of the passage. Albert surprised himself and everyone else as he let fly with a whitish-blue blast back into the hole.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">An ugly grey form darted through the opening and fired back. Albert was able to drop it with another blast, although it wasn't as large or energetic as his first. The thing dropped in a tangle of long arms and short legs. A gaping maw of teeth bifurcated the hideously deformed face. Wiry greyish black fur covered most of it and it twitched and gibbered as greenish fluid spilled from the wound Albert's bolt had torn.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rapidly the Eternia team scrambled back away from the shattered hole as numerous black balls of energy sizzled and snapped from within.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They dove for cover behind various piles of rubble on the platform as Albert and Max fired small energies back at the pursuing things. Valerie made a frantic run for the train and swung a digging cutter toward the passage. Firing the cutter randomly into the area she was rewarded with several shrieks of pain.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly a well placed black ball slammed into the digger and melted the front of it. Valerie dropped to the deck and lay still. Several more black bursts splashed against the side of the train. One of them burnt a hole through the side of the engine. Tom dove from the cab as dark smoke billowed out the cab door and the hole in the side. He staggered to the nearest group cradling his arm in a pained grip. Amanda took a quick look and determined it was broken. Turning to Mat she said quickly, "Mat, I Need an aid kit. Think you can get one?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mat dropped into a crouch and scrambled for the next section of rubble. Once there he grabbed the aid kit from Alexa and headed back. Energy balls sizzled into the rubble around him as he leapt for cover. He shrieked in agony as black fire seared across his ankle as he slid in behind Amanda. She grabbed the aid kit and began working on Tom. Once she finished with Tom she pulled the burnt fabric back from Mat's ankle. Charred flesh covered the ragged burn. She slapped a dressing on it as she spoke, "You'll need a full healer to look at your ankle when we get back. Take this for the pain." She passed him a pill. "Let me know if it isn't enough."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Albert and Max fired back at the emerging figures when they could get a clean shot. The situation rapidly degenerated into a standoff as both sides had enough cover to protect them but not enough to advance or retreat effectively. At one point Amanda tried to make a run for Valerie but quickly scrambled back behind cover as she was immediately targeted.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Over the next hour the dark forces attempted several times to make a break for the Death City train. Each time the pinned down Death City team managed to drive them back. Each time the Death City crew tried to get back to the train they were also driven back.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Just when it seemed completely hopeless Albert happened to notice movement from the subway tunnel. Back in the distance three figures moved stealthily toward the platform and the skirmish occurring there. When they reached the end of the tunnel the broke and ran straight at the dark forces. Screaming and firing energy weapons as they charged into the flanks of the enemy.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Black bolts rained down around them from the rapidly recovering forces. One of them dived across a pile of broken stone and rubble. Frantically it stood and clawed at itself until its backpack fell off. It sprang away from the pack as it flared into a bright explosion. For a moment the figure stood in apparent shock, until one of the others staggered from a blow to the head. Then with an animal howl of rage it launched itself into a mass of grey dark forces bodies. Energy shimmered and crackled around the now spinning figure as it dealt death on all near it. One of the other two stopped to watch for long moments, almost getting itself killed in the process. The dancing figure turned to the still figure and said, "Come, dance with me." The words echoed through the tunnel drawing Audrey and half the others into motion until a black bolt sizzled into the ground in front of them. Looks of shock and confusion appeared as they jumped back to safety.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A blast of energy blasted rubble from the floor at the feet of the dancing figure. Another shriek echoed through the tunnel as it grabbed the nearest grey creature and hurled it back into the shadowy recesses of the passage. It returned to its dance of death and soon the dark forces were reduced to bodies scattered on the platform and in the mouth of the passage. The other two figures slowly approached the third. Slowly the shimmering faded and the third figure slumped in exhaustion. They turned and approached the huddled group where Audrey was. "Merris sent us to get you out of here. I am Sammi, this is Jemima," she said pointing to the second figure. "And this is Kali," she finished pointing to the one who had danced death with such wild abandon.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jemima looked at the team where they huddled on the platform. "Where is your driver?" Silently Audrey pointed to Tom where he sat cradling a broken arm. "Are you able to drive?" He shook his head. "Anybody else know how?" The rest of the group shook their heads no as well. "Sammi, you and I need to get the power shield up. Do you think you could give Kali enough instruction that she could take the train out? We need to clear the track and keep the recovered items out of the hands of the dark forces."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I can try," Sammi replied as she lead Kali toward the engine.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jemima ran for the passage and planted the shield creator. She began the first part of the activation sequence while waiting for Sammi to join her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> In the cab Sammi rapidly pointed to various controls and gave Kali instructions for them. She returned just in time to hear Erick commenting to Mat, "Kali, wow. What a woman." Sammi rolled her eyes and moved to help with the shield. She passed Amanda who was running for Valerie in the cargo car. She leapt aboard and was bending down as the train began to move. She struggled to get the door closed as the train pulled away from the platform. Albert took a running jump and landed next to her. Together they hauled the door closed as the train rumbled into the tunnel.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The power shield flared into life just as the train disappeared up the tunnel. Dark figures began to emerge from the hole in the wall once again but they couldn't get around the shield plugging the passage opening. They held back just short of the shield while testing its strength with bolts of black.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Twenty minutes later another train rolled into place at the platform. Quickly Dennis hustled the rest of the team on board. As soon as the doors closed the driver had the train in motion. The team sat in stunned silence as they entered the void. Slowly subdued conversations started up around the car as they tried to deal with the death of at last one of them. Audrey finally gathered enough courage to ask Sammi if there was any way to find out about Valerie.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'll see if the driver can get any information from dispatch." She replied as she started forward.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She returned ten minutes later. "Valerie is still alive and healers are working on her. They aren't sure yet if she'll make it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jemima leaned close and asked softly, "And Kali?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She's shaken up but coping, at least as far as Merris could tell. Merris did say she was sorry the change was forced on her so soon after arrival. She's pretty sure Kali hasn't recognized the fact yet."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I imagine not. We'll see how she really does once she has time to notice."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When the train finally pulled into Portal Station Merris herself came out to meet it. She stood at the front of the car and reported that Valerie was still alive and the healers were more optimistic now that they had her in the infirmary. She praised the abilities of the team in keeping a bad situation from becoming worse and then bid them good speed down to their homes. "Valerie is in the infirmary at Bethenheim, the city between here and Death City. I can redirect the train there if enough of you would like. Otherwise there are plenty of commuting runs between Central Station and Bethenheim Central."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In the end the team decided to Bethenheim instead of Death City. A few minutes later Merris cleared the way and they continued their somber journey.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Several hours later a very grim looking Audrey walked into the Cathouse. She barely nodded to most of the people she knew and made her way quickly to the bar where Ennui was working. She waited for a slight break in the orders and then asked Ennui if she could meet her back stage for a few minutes. "And could you arrange for someone to take over for you? You might want a break when we're done."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui motioned to Dissolution, a tall cadaverous looking man of indeterminate age. He was dressed in his usual undertaker's outfit and was gathering used glassware into a kitchen tub. He set down his burden and hurried over. "I need to take a bit of a break. Think you can handle the crowd?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," he answered in a deep measured voice. "I will call Delirium if I need help."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks," Ennui said as she followed Audrey up the stairs and into the back areas. "What's wrong,"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Audrey threw herself into Ennui's arms and sobbed as she told of the mission gone wrong. Ennui eased her down to the floor and held her while she wept. Fresh tears of her own joined the rain as she remembered Dementia's stricken face earlier in the day. Although they had still hoped the disaster could have been avoided. As the storm of tears slowly tapered off Ennui offered, "Would you like to stay here tonight? We have spare apartments. Or you can stay with Dementia and I. It might be best not to be alone right now..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I...thanks...I guess I could...it was just so sudden. Nothing like this has happened before, has it? I've never heard of it..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No," Dementia answered as she came into the room. "There've been near misses but never anyone killed by the forces on a mission."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I was just offering to let Audrey stay with us tonight."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I agree, you should stay here. Much better to spend time with friends."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I've got to tell the others in the band..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Time enough tomorrow. Besides, I can do it. As the one who pulled us all together it could be said it's my responsibility anyway. Let them have one last night without the pain." They guided Audrey upstairs and offered her Ennui's old bed. In the end she chose the papasan chair in the main room.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once she was settled the other two retired to their room. "Damn, I was hoping..." Dementia began.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know. So was I. I'm going to miss the irritating shit." Ennui started crying again as Dementia held her. Gently she stroked her hair and eased her down when sleep finally came. Curling herself protectively around Ennui Dementia sought sleep as well.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Angry yells woke them In the front room Audrey was screaming and ranting, "Stupid fuck! I can't believe he's gone. I was going to give him a chance finally. Arrogant little prick. Damn it!!!" She slammed her fists again and again into the chair. Shaking with rage and sorrow she stalked around the room and then slammed fists into the chair again. She kept repeating the cycle for fifteen minutes while Dementia and Ennui watched from the doorway.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Several times Ennui started to move into the room only to have Dementia hold her back. "This is part of the process. Let her get through it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When Audrey finally slumped to the floor in front of the chair Dementia gave Ennui a tiny push, "Now..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui slowly approached Audrey. When she was almost to her she raised her tear stained face and asked, "Why?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mutely Ennui shook her head, "I don't know...chance, bad chance..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What do we do now? What do I do now?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Cry, scream, and yell. Keeping going is good too."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Audrey rounded on her, "How can you be so calm?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dementia saw this yesterday. I already knew. I'm being calm for you, and for Nausea and Bella later. It..I..I cried most of yesterday while you were still...still..." Ennui's voice broke as tears ran down her face. "See? Not so calm..." she said through her sniffles. Silently Dementia crossed to them, handed them tissues, and wrapped her arms around them. Silent tears tracked her face as well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Most of the morning was spent mourning their fallen friend. By early afternoon hunger pulled them up and out toward the Adam and Eve. Audrey glanced up the street. "Damn, got to deal with the latest batch of beer later..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How can you.."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Think of beer at a time like this? Some things wait for no one. If I want a great brew timing is everything." She gave a ghost of a smile, "Besides, isn't that the cure in the Realms? Throw yourself into work or something?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I guess..." Ennui started.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's true her too. Just remember to rely on friends as well. This place demands that you help yourself and that sometimes means letting someone else help you. We're here, let us help when we can."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Audrey nodded through watery eyes, not trusting herself to speak. Silently they entered the pub and sat down to order.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Much later they emerged into late afternoon. Audrey headed to the brewery to take care of her beer and Ennui turned toward Princes Street and the shop above which Nausea and Belladonna lived.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey love, want me to come with you?" Dementia asked. Ennui thought hard about it for a bit and then nodded. "Ok."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They walked down the street staring into the shop windows. At last they reached their destination and paused at the door. Slowly Ennui forced herself forward and opened it. They walked up single file and stopped outside the door to the apartment. For a long time they stood staring at the door, gathering strength before knocking loudly. Moments later Nausea poked her head around the door, "Ennui, Dementia, what's happening?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Umm, can weI come in?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, of course you can?" Nausea took a look at Ennui's strained face and threw open the door. "What's the matter?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You remember the mission Le Mort was on?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, he was supposed to get back last night. We were going to go meet him but got distracted..." Nausea trailed off at the empty look Ennui couldn't hide. "Something happened, didn't it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui nodded as Dementia spoke slowly, "Le Mort was killed in a surprise attack by one of the Forces. He didn't suffer..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh goddess!" Belladonna exclaimed. "Does Audrey know?" She smacked her head then and exclaimed, "Of course she knows. She went too didn't she?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui nodded again. "Yeah, she saw it happen."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shit," Nausea said softly. "How is she?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"As good as can be expected. She stayed with us last night."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Right now she's taking care of brewery duties. We're going to try and talk her into staying with us again tonight."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Over the next few days they began to heal from the loss of Le Mort. At first everything was a reminder but that slowly faded as well. Love's Bitch worked to make up for their missing singer, evolving into a more varied version of what they had bee. Slowly they found ways to still rock the house although each member felt as if there was a last little spark missing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A few days after the mission Dementia was at the main bar when she glanced up as someone moved through the door. At first she couldn't say what had drawn her attention however as the figure came closer it was the lack of costume that held her eye. The figure seemed both drawn and repelled by the music and crowd of the club.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hesitantly it made its way to the bar and settled onto an open stool in the dark corner at the end of the bar. Dementia finished her drink orders and headed that direction. "What would you like?" she asked the huddled figure, examining the woman as she waited for an answer. The woman was tall and muscular. She wore a battered olive drab jump suit kind of garment. Her face was plain and angular with a largish nose and intense grey eyes. Her hair was red and a tangle of waves and curls that lent a bit of softness to her features.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The green eyes flicked to the drink board and grabbed at the first thing they saw, Morphine Drip please." Dementia watched the woman for just a second more before walking over to the drink apparatus and starting one of her special concoctions.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once it was finished she returned to the silent figure and handed it to her. "One Morphine Drip."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The woman took a tentative sip, smiled, and said, "Wicked! Thanks."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia smiled in return and replied, "Glad you like it. It's one of our specialties. Haven't come here before have you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No. It's kind of obvious, I know."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing to be ashamed of, just asking. It's easier to let go with a costume." Dementia noticed just how uneasy the woman was when Erick moved up beside her and her head twitched around. The action was more like a startled cat than a relaxed person.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick called out as he settled in near the woman, "Hey Dementia, how about a Blood Wine?" He glanced again at the woman next to him and recognized her. He smiled and said, "Kali, hi! I didn't know you came here. Dementia, this is Kali, she's the one who saved my ass the other day."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, interesting name..." Dementia stated questioningly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Deliberate, I'm afraid. I changed it shortly before I left the Realms."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks for saving Erick's scrawny ass. We wouldn't know what to do around here without him coming in nightly."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No problems, I was in the neighborhood anyway." Kali answered dryly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick turned to examine his back side before saying, "Hey, it is not scrawny. Just in the neighborhood, huh?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So, Kali, you ready for another one? And yes it is scrawny."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I would like another."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, Erick, I'll start yours as well, although I should make you get your own, you hang out here enough to pitch in now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just remember to shake it this time. You know how nasty they are if you don't."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia rolled her eyes and moved off laughing, "Sure, sure."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I see you everywhere..." Kali began.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, you do seem to pick all my favorite hangouts." Erick turned serious for a moment and asked, "So, are you doing ok now? You didn't seem to feel so good about the rescue earlier."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I'm better."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia returned making a great show of carefully shaking Erick's blood wine before handing it to him with a flourish, "Just remember the rules. You can either drink it or wear it. Kali, here's yours."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hooked another one I see. That one seems to be the most popular so far."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It is. Something seems to really work between the butterscotch and the amaretto."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali stared down into her test tube and asked, "How bad are these?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia laughed as she said, "Oh, pretty bad. Mostly it's the 151 rum. I'd try not to do more than a couple an hour unless you have a really good tolerance."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick turned to Kali and asked, "Are you going to sit there all night or did you come to dance?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Walls snapped into place in Kali's eyes. Dementia saw them but Erick didn't notice as Kali answered, "I'm not sure why I came. I'm not really dressed right for here and..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You're fine. Come, dance. I heard something about a newcomer that kicked ass the other night at the Adam and Eve." Erick pressed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali slammed her drink and turned to survey the dance floor. Dementia saw her stiffen, her breathing turned deep and ragged as her hands clenched. A thin cloud of black and red bands seemed to seethe around her. Concerned Dementia began to head toward Mortiss in case his help was needed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Just when Dementia was about to signal Mortiss the fog dissipated in a small puff of heat. Ice cold pale eyes stared out of Kali's face as she intoned in a voice fat with danger and seduction, "Come, dance with me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia started to follow her until she bumped hard into the bar. Disoriented she asked, "What just happened?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not certain. I don't think we were in any real danger though." Erick answered.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia shook her head again. She motioned for Mortiss to keep an eye on Kali just in case Erick was wrong about the situation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Down on the dance floor Kali danced like a woman possessed. By the eighth song Erick was panting and dripping sweat while Kali kept moving as if she had just started. He finally gasped out, "How about we take a breather?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You go ahead, I'm not tired yet. Can't you feel the energy? Breathe it in!" Erick gave up at the end of the eighth song and tottered over toward the bar. He flopped down at the bar and ordered from Delirium. He sipped slowly until he saw Kali approach.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She settled onto a stool and turned to order. Ennui took her request for a Morphine Drip and moved off to make it. Behind her Erick asked, "What happened earlier? You want to talk about it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Again he missed the haunted look that flashed across her face as she answered firmly, "No." He started to push again until he noticed the ice demon in her eyes. She slammed the rest of her drink, smiled a twisted, almost bitter smile and asked, "You coming?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick rose to follow when Ennui stopped him with her voice. "You sure know how to pick them don't you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"ennui, hi. Yeah, I guess I do at that. But she sure is intense! Got to love that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Have you ever thought about trying less complicated people? They are out there you know."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I don't like to be bored." He had turned away to watch Kali dance so he didn't see the look of annoyance flicker across Ennui's face.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Less intense doesn't mean boring. God, you can be such an ass hole."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What?" He said, still distracted by Kali's dancing. "She sure is a great dancer." His eyes were fixed on Kali's whirling form. "Look at all that energy!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Erick," Ennui waited until he turned to her. "Listen to me please. You don't want this one, she's trouble. Please trust me on this."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Trouble? She wouldn't be allowed in here if she was dangerous. That's the way Death City works."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Erick, she is trouble for you. Look at her. You can almost see her demons chasing around her head. Remember when you first arrived how your past haunted you? That's where she is right now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But I settled right in. Dementia helped, so did a lot of others. Maybe it's my turn to help someone else."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui reached across the bar and took his hands, "Ok, look, I don't want to hurt you here but look at her, she's gay for one..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You know that's not hard and fast here! You weren't before you got here. She doesn't have to stay that way here either..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui looked down, "You didn't hear this, ok, since it's hers to tell and not mine. She's a Shadow Walker, ok? Are you sure you want to get involved with a Walker?" She paused a moment, then went on pleadingly, "Look, she seems nice enough, if a little cold. Just be her friend for a while before you try to be more alright? Can I at least ask you to do that? Remember what I said about desperation."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick pulled back stunned, not really hearing the rest of what Ennui said. "A Walker? How can you know that? How could she be?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"If you look, you can see it..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui! There aren't any signs."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There are if you know what to look for."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You're wrong." He stared at her. "You can't know that. She's just a mixed up new arrival that's had some troubles."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She stared at him for long moments and then spoke quietly and firmly, "I'm going to tell you something and if you breath a word of it I'll ask her to help me gut you. I know she's a Walker. You want to know how?" She waited a beat until he nodded slightly, "I know because I am as well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But...But..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Look, I don't want your pity and neither will she." Ennui hissed when she saw pity appear on his face. "It's as much a gift as a curse, regardless of what the rest of you think. I've got others to serve."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui!" He called as she stalked away. She turned cold eyes back toward him, "I'm sorry for what I said." Her eyes thawed a bit at his words and she gave him a short nod before continuing down the bar.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Erick sat for a long time in silence before slowly making his way back to the dance floor. He saw Kali still dancing near one of the shadowed corners and his nerve broke. Silently he turned and hurried from the club.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali returned to the bar shortly after Erick had fled.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>"Would you like another Morphine Drip?"
<p class="regtxt5">" Yes please. Oh, and did you happen to notice what happened to Erick? The guy I was talking to?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He headed out. Said it was getting late for him."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, ok. Thanks."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui turned to go, then stopped and turned back, "Erick's a nice guy..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali grinned at what she thought were the implications as she said, "I'm not interested in him that way. He's yours as far as I'm concerned."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui blushed as she said, "No, that's not what I meant."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I was just wondering. He sometimes comes on a bit strong and I was wondering if he offended you or anything..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked at Ennui in puzzlement. "I guess I'm confused now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Erick is a friend of mine and I just wanted to let you know he's not a bad guy."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Uh huh. I got that part. He's also fairly brave and a sensitive kind of guy in a lot of ways. I got that too... I guess I'm wondering why you are taking the time to tell a stranger about him."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Cuz he's got the hots for you and I thought you should at least be warned. And I ...well I told him you were a Walker."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali leaned across the bar and said in a deceptively quiet voice, "And why did you do that?" Ice dripped from her next words, "Don't you think that's going rather far?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui gulped but kept her ground. "Yes, yes it is. I told him you were and that I am. I told him to scare him away. I told him so you wouldn't have to chase him away and I wouldn't have to listen to him go on and on about another crush." Confused tears dripped from Ennui's eyes. "Goddess, I don't know why it's so important to me..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He's a good friend. Is that what it is?" Kali leaned back, uncertain of what to say next. Curiosity won out in the end. "So, you're another Walker? I would like to ask you about that sometime soon. Would that be possible?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui nodded rapidly, still seeing a certain amount of menace deep in Kali's cool grey eyes. "Sure, yeah, how about you come by here during the day either tomorrow or the next day? We can talk then."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, sounds good." Kali turned and rapidly slipped out of the Cathouse. Ennui remained where she was for a long time before she noticed the drink orders flying around her once more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In bed she turned to Dementia and said, "I met the strangest person tonight."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Let me guess, tallish muscular woman with intense grey eyes, name of Kali."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How did you know?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She stopped at the bar upstairs first. Erick knows her as well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He does and she's his latest crush."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui, that's not a good idea." Dementia said in a very serious tone.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't think so either. I tried to dissuade him but I don't think it worked. She isn't interested though."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She's trouble for him. She's one I've seen. Things are going to get much more dangerous around here now. She's one of the signs and one of the champions we'll need."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Makes me wonder sometimes, why am I here? You get the visions, Le Mort was a finder, Kali seems like she's destined for battles, what do I do? I help run a club. Seems strange to me..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia wrapped Ennui in her arms. "You keep me sane, you help with a place where people can come to let off stress after hard missions. You can coordinate with Merris when I can't even see straight through my visions. Without you the warnings wouldn't get out in time."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But you managed before me..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Only because the dangers and the visions weren't nearly as intense. I wouldn't manage any more."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I guess so," Ennui agreed reluctantly. She lapsed into silence and let Dementia slip into sleep. She stared at the ceiling for a long time wrestling with the doubts that wouldn't quite. Several hours later she finally slept.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali found Ennui late the next afternoon while she was checking the drink apparatus on the dance level. "You said come find you today..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I did."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This Shadow Walker thing, what can you tell me about it?" Kali asked abruptly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not much I'm afraid. No one likes to talk about it. All I could find out is most people here envy and pity us."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's it? I haven't found out any more than that either. Although I would like to know how you knew right away..." She added suspiciously.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know...maybe it was your energies or something. I just could tell. Maybe it was cause you are the first Walker I've met other than myself..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Argh!" Kali hissed in frustration. "That seems to be the story of this place. No one knows anything or wants to talk about anything... I never was interested in the new age-y way of thinking and here I am in a world a friend and I created..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Whoa, what do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I read a story on the internet and started writing to the person who had written it. It was about this place. We started writing other stories in this world. Then after a thoroughly awful week this strange little tram showed up and offered me a ride. It dropped me off here...since then it's been an exercise in frustration trying to figure this place out..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Is that necessary? The figuring it out? Isn't it enough to be here in a place where what you do matters? That was why I came along when offered, I wanted to do something more important than the bullshit of the Realms."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, that's part of why I stayed, but I still want to know more about how all this works. Why do some of us get chosen, how did it all start, things like that. The part of me that was writing in this world before still wants to understand it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So here's one for you. Do you think you and your friend were making this up or channeling it from what existed?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ma..." Kali stopped abruptly, not sure what she wanted to believe now. "I don't know. I would have said making it up but it seems like it has life of its own. So maybe we were just seeing little pieces of the reality..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks for saving Erick's ass. He can be an annoying dweeb, but he's not a bad guy."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, he's not, I just don't want him to think I'm interested in him. I'm not."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Don't take this wrong ok? Erick falls in lust with any woman who shows intense reactions to anything. He latched onto you because you did what you did in the fight where he met you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So the next person that comes along will divert his attentions? Wicked awesome. Maybe I can find someone to do it sooner..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's how it works with Erick."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked intently at Ennui for and asked, "Are you interested in him?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I sort of was. I ended up with someone else though. Someone unexpected...why am I telling you this?" Ennui laughed nervously.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Because I have a friendly face?" Kali answered almost sarcastically.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, cuz you are another Walker. Erick is one who really freaks at the thought of Walkers. I'm not sure what he'll say next time he sees me, now that he knows..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure he'll manage somehow... I should get going, I was going to meet the rest of the Temple Heath crowd at the Adam and Eve."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe I'll see you there later. Sometimes we do dinner there rather from the club kitchen. It was great to see you again!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia walked in shortly after Kali had left to check the beer taps. "We good for tonight?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Looks like it. Kali came back..." Ennui began thoughtfully. "I still don't know what to make of her. She has this weird mix of insecurity, vulnerability, confidence and daring at the same time. Just when I think she's a total bitch she says something vulnerable or kind."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds like adaptation issues."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She did mention wanting to understand this place and running into the vagueness of it all."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's hard. I've seen a few new recruits over the years struggle with that. I guess it's a lesson for them. Dinner here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How about the pub? Kali hangs out with the Temple Heath crowd. I would like to observe a bit more of her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why Ennui, I didn't think you were that much of a snoop..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This time I am. I thought you'd be as well. If Kali is one of these signs you've been seeing."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Lead on then devious girlfriend." Dementia grinned. Ennui hugged her and then headed out.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">They made their way to the under chamber of the Adam and Eve where they found a corner near one of the walls. It gave them a reasonable view of the rest of the chamber and particularly the Temple Heath table in the center. The table was already packed with people, food, and beer glasses.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jo made her way over just as Allen looked up and spotted them. "Hey, over here. Don't be strangers, come join us!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia shook her head as Bart chimed in, "Come on over Dementia. I haven't seen much of you these past months. I'd think you had a new partner or something."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia and Ennui blushed deep red as they acquiesced. "As a matter of fact I do. Bart, you remember Ennui don't you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He smiled brightly, "Of course I do! Good to see you again. I'm glad you get along with her. She does better when she's not alone." He stopped when he saw Dementia looking uncomfortable. "Sit and be welcome with us." He turned and waved at the table, "This is the Temple Heath regulars. Merris I'm sure you know..." He added, waving to where Merris sat next to Kali.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Merris?" Dementia quietly asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Bart grinned wickedly and said softly, "She seems to have some interest in things down here all of a sudden." He remarked loudly to the table, "Everyone, this is Ennui and Dementia. Dementia and Ennui, you'll get to know these rowdies pretty quickly. It'll be easier than my introducing all of them and then having you forget immediately."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, we can't stay long, but thanks for inviting us over."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's fine. just no reason for you to stay by yourselves when you have friends over here." The table returned to random conversations as Ennui and Dementia ordered and ate. They would add a bit here and there to the conversation but mostly just ate and listened. Kali was laughing it up with Merris and the rest of the table, much more at ease than they had seen her at the club. All too soon it was time for them to leave.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Outside Dementia turned to Ennui, "Kali and Merris do you think?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui leaned into her lover and said, "Yeah, I think. Did you see their body language? They were much closer than necessary."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That would be great. Merris needs a distraction from dispatch. She's been hermitting up there ever since I fished her out of a lake."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Over the next few days it fell into an almost ritual to go and eat with the Temple Heath crowd. They got to know Allen and some of the other Temple Heath people quite well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The fifth night they were sitting close to Kali when she leaned over and asked Jo, "Jo, who is that over in the corner? I see her here almost every night for the last week."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know her name. She never gives it. I think she might be mute or something because she never speaks. I've seen her help mum out in the kitchen a few times, more than that, who can say?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now that you mention it I've seen her at the cathouse a few times. She always sits at the dance floor bar in the darkest corner she can find. Her favorite drinks are Assisted Suicides and Asthma Attacks which she orders with notes scribbled on a small white board. You know, I don't think I've ever seen her dance or talk to anyone." Ennui added.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali watched the woman in the shadows as she sat with her friends. The woman sat quietly in the darkest corner under one of the arches supporting the roof vault. She was typing continuously on a battered laptop. Once in a great while she would look up for a moment and then return to staring at the screen. At last curiosity overcame reluctance and Kali rose. She strode boldly toward the table intent on asking the woman who she was. As she approached something in the scene slowed her down until she was moving slowly and with great deference. When she reached the table she said quietly, "Excuse me..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The figure looked up from the battered grey laptop. The only color on it was a gold mud flap girl decal in the center of the fold up display. Kali blinked in surprise at the empty voids where the eyes should have been. When she looked again tired grey eyes regarded her. "Yes?" the word was whispered tonelessly with just the hint of a question at the end.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"May I join you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For long moments the eyes regarded her expressionlessly. At last the figure raised a hand from the keyboard and waved assent. Kali spun a chair out from the table, straddled it, and rested her elbows on the chair back. For long moments she regarded the silent figure as well. The woman was neither young, nor old. Her face was nondescript, not beautiful or ugly, or handsome, or plain. It was a face it would be very hard to pick out of a crowd. Her hair was a no color brown and worn long and straight. She wore baggy clothing over a thin androgynous frame. After a long scrutiny Kali asked, "May I ask what you are writing?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The figure stared at Kali until she grew uncomfortable. Then a hint of a smile appeared on the face. Kali was never sure if it was real or slightly mocking because the expressionless whispered word reverberated in her head like a gong. "You," was the single word reply.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali sat stunned as ice crawled up her back. Finally she pried herself up from the chair and stumbled back to the Temple Heath table on rubbery legs. Her face was still pale as she sat quietly beside Merris and stared into her stout.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Almost immediately Erick was asking, "Are you ok? What's her deal anyway?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I...she...uh...nothing..." Kali replied in a shaking voice. She took a long drink of beer before adding, "She doesn't talk about herself and she prefers her privacy."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What did she say to you?" Erick pressed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I...I'd rather not say..." He started to ask again until Kali turned frosty eyes on him and stated coldly, "I will not say." Erick gulped and went back to his drink.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The figure packed the battered laptop into a ragged pack sack and stood. She flung a worn black leather duster over her thin frame, shouldered the pack, and slipped toward the exit stairs. She hugged the shadows as she went.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Curious Ennui stood to follow. She motioned to Dementia as she went. Together they trailed the figure up the stairs and out into the night. She crossed the bridge and made her way to the Cathouse. There she picked a shadowy section near the main door and settled down to wait. Ennui started to approach but as she came closer and closer she felt uneasiness crawling up her back. As she moved closer the feeling grew into an unreasoned dread. Cold emptiness seemed to radiate from the still figure. When she was within five feet she found she could move no closer. Ennui peered into the shadow trying to make out the woman's expression but the shadows were too thick. Slowly she retreated back to the Cathouse doors. "Goddess, now I know what spooked Kali," she mumbled as she reached Dementia. "Wow, that was weird."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What was it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A feeling of emptiness, almost like there was a shell there but nothing inside it...a cold empty shell sitting in a shadow..." She shivered slightly and moved closer to the club. "Let's go open shall we? If she come in tonight I'm going to try and see where she goes when she leaves."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds good to me as well. If you can signal me on the way out I'll come as well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Behind them the shadow stirred as the figure slowly eased itself erect. A faint grin flickered briefly across her features as the woman slipped into the Cathouse and to her seat in the shadows of the bar. She was settled and had her laptop out by the time Ennui and Darien came down from the upper level.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui started as she noticed the figure already at the end of the bar. She was able to approach without any reaction when it waved at her. On the white board was a request for an Asthma Attack. When ever the woman wasn't directly requesting something she would be typing furiously on a laptop.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui kept an eye on the figure throughout the night, watching to see when it left. The figure remained at the club most of the night. Only as the crowd began to thin did it pack its laptop and rise. Swiftly Ennui moved to follow. The figure slipped up the darkest stairway and along the edge of the upper room. Ennui waved frantically at Dementia until she saw and nodded. Outside the club the figure moved swiftly to the railroad and followed it toward the spillway from the higher sections of the town.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Just about at the base of the spillway was an old, rundown warehouse. The figure took the steps up to the loading platform, opened a small door and entered the dark building. A few minutes later lights came on in a section of the second floor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't think there was anything over here," Dementia commented.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Recent additions?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe... Wonder what this woman's story is? She's even more enigmatic than most."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We can ask around. See if anyone we know has any ideas."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It turned out Audrey was the only other person to have interacted at all with the mystery woman. "No, I don't know her name either. She showed up a couple of weeks ago and asked to help around the brewery. I put her to work cleaning since she didn't indicate she had any previous brewing skills."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So she talked to you then?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No. She used that white board of hers, just like she does with you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Did you know she lives in an old warehouse near the spillway?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So that's her? I saw lights in the top of a warehouse over there recently. Figured it was just another new arrival that I hadn't met yet."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The first time I went on a mission with Kali it was supposed to be a routine rescue mission. As I was to find out with all things Kali, this was not how it ended up. For this mission she was along as just another team member. We deployed into the target areas and began the recovery work. Audrey was along because she had become quite a good seeker after the death of Le Mort. Once all the items in the main area had been located Kali and I were assigned to a new team along with Anton,Lauren, Lissa and Natasha. Alisha was placed in charge and we set off to find the last item. Alisha was strangely cagey with the information of what we were supposed to find. Still we progressed rapidly to the top of one of the hills nearby. There Alisha motioned everyone down and then pointed to the far edge of the hill.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali shrugged in my direction and inched forward. What she saw must have not been what she expected cause I saw her stiffen. When I inched forward to join her I saw the valley opening out below us. On the far side was a cluster of buildings around a large cluster of stones. I looked over at Alisha and mouthed, "Is it over there?" Just then a small group of grey skinned beings emerged from one of the buildings. Other groups joined in from the remaining buildings until a large gathering surrounded the stones. They began to dance and sway in a strange rhythmic pattern. It was disturbing and compelling in an odd sort of way. After a few minutes I found I didn't want to take my eyes off it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Alisha motioned us back although most of us ignored her. She had to pull my head away from the site below before I would pay any attention to her. Once she had our attention again she gave us our assignments. "We need to stop them from opening that gate. At least until the rest of the mission is completed. Lauren, Natasha and I have some magic that we can use that should blast the stones and topple them. The rest of you need to keep watch to make certain we aren't disturbed."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali immediately returned to watching the valley while the rest of us stared off in various directions. We would sneak glances back whenever we thought no one was looking. Alisha, Lauren, and Natasha started chanting and gesturing. At first nothing seemed to happen but then slowly I could feel something like a static charge building around the three of them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I could feel it ebbing and flowing like a hesitant tide. It would surge up and fall back as the rhythm of their voices struggled to remain steady. In the distance I heard Kali's muttered whisper as if I were standing next to her, "Damn it, come on. They've almost go the gate open..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I turned to look just as a small white ball formed near Alisha. She tried to juggle it in a shaking hand as Kali snapped, "Transfer control. Give me the pattern, you're losing it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You haven't been trained. I can't," Alisha replied.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Transfer control, NOW. I can stabilize it. Give me the pattern!" A flash of anger flitted across Alishas face as she tossed the energy ball angrily toward Kali. It darted to a place above her head and began to pulse and wobble crazily. Sweat popped out on Kali's face as she fought some type of battle with it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For long moments it all seemed to hang in a twisted sort of balance until the ball suddenly popped into a perfect ball of light. Looks of wonder formed on Lauren and Alisha's faces as they shifted toward Kali. As they focused on her the white ball swelled to five times its original size, turning lop-sided and wavery as it did. The pattern blossomed in Kali's head. Her face twisted into a silent shriek as she snarled out, "Too much! I have enough!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Energy crackled and sizzled in her hair. Lightning danced from her fingertips to the ground as she raged and fought to restore the perfect ball. After long minutes the corona around her dimmed and the ball shrunk back to a dancing globe of white. Kali looked up at it and smiled. With a gentle little push she nudged it toward the dark energies I had been ignoring that were gathered around the stones.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Like a ball rolling down a hill the little globe of light started moving slowly, gathering speed as it went. "Get down! The back-blast can kill you!" Alisha yelled. I started to dive until I saw Kali standing calmly watching the little ball. Mesmerized I watch as well as it gently bumped into the roiling black cloud of energy. There was a firm THUMP and the black energy vanished. Little grey dust devils danced away from the stones and into the grey beings. Eleven of them dropped soundlessly to the dirt.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Alisha stood shakily and stared at Kali, "What have you done?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I balanced the gate with a counter-gate," Kali replied calmly. I noticed her twitch her head a bit when the others weren't watching. She caught my gaze and gave me an imperceptible wink.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She turned toward the others when Lissa gave a ragged little laugh and said, "Of course, she must be the new Writer Big Joe mentioned." And yes, the capital 'W' was attached to the term writer. I would learn more about that in time as I got to know Kali better. But right then I was more puzzled than the others by the remark.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, leave it to a Writer. They never do things the usual way," Marren added.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, Ms. Writer, shall we get out of here now?" Lauren asked with a bit of awe apparent in her voice. Kali nodded and motioned for Alisha to lead the way. I ended up beside her as we headed back.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That was pretty impressive back there. How did you know to do that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure... Ever since I got here I just know things I never would have before. Some days it makes my head hurt."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"At least you have some idea. I've been here for a while now and still don't know why. I want to help out and..." A panicked twitchy feeling ran up my spine. Without even thinking I dove sideways into Kali and brought us both to the ground. A black ball of energy sailed through where we had been moments before. "Alisha, the rest of you get down NOW!" Black energy bursts shot through the air. One clipped Lauren as she dropped slower than the others. "Kali, can..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui, get the rest of them out of here and warn the main team. We have to go as soon as everyone is there." As I watched pale ice replaced her eyes and she began dancing an odd pattern while power crackled around her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I turned and crawled as fast as I could toward the others. As I crawled I began to understand Kali's confusion as patterns appeared in my head. It was almost like the computer images that were used in movies. In my mind I could see the hill we were on and the position where the black balls had come from. There was a second clot of dark grey beings slipping around to the right through a glade of trees. A third group of enemies was making its way up from the valley in a line that would take them to the train. Alisha and the others were also there in the positions they occupied. While I tried to sort it all out the image that was Kali began to move toward the larger third group.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Complex movement plans danced through the image as my mind went off on its own and began running various scenarios of action. Tiny little figures danced up and down the hillside, first moving one way then the other, always in a jerky kind of fast motion. In each case some or all of the figures on my side dropped and didn't move again. Suddenly one snapped into focus. The little figures danced a simple pattern and then ran for the train. As soon as I reached Alisha I started it in motion for real. "Alisha, you move left and around the clump of trees, come up on their flank. Fire into the center of them. There's a leader in there, the third one up from the back and surrounded by the tallest ones. Don't kill it, just knock it out. As soon as the center figures drop break around the back of them and run for the recovery team." Next I came to Anton where he was tending to Lauren, "Can you move her? If so, start back for the recovery team. We'll be right behind you. Warn them they have half an hour to get things wrapped up." Then I crawled over to Lissa, "Are you able to do magic on your own?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She gave a frightened nod, "What do you want me to do?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You're with me. We are going around to the right through the bushes over there," I pointed where we would go. "There's a small group coming up just to the right of those bushes. In the back is a spell user. We need to knock it out. Do not kill these things."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why not? I know how to do that...I think..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It..." the words began to form in my head as I spoke them, "It's a balance issue. If we kill then they can. If we don't they won't either." I wanted to stop and think about this new development but there was no time. Quickly we crawled to the bushes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once we were in position Lissa turned frightened eyes on me, "I...I don't know how to do this..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Fear chased through my stomach and I wanted to shake her something awful. Instead I reached out and put a hand on her shoulder, "Think back to how you do magic. It had to be terrifying the first time but you did it. You can do it now. I trust you." It was amazing to watch her face clear. I had a moment of pride realizing I had done that. She drew herself up and chanted a few weird sounds. Seconds later she shot her left hand out and a pink shaft of energy leapt from her fingertips. It splashed against a larger grey figure in the center of the clot of beings just emerging from a small grove of trees. It gave a short grunt of anger and dropped to the ground in a shapeless huddle.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wow!" She turned to me smiling in triumph.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Awesome job! Now we run for the train. I bet it'll be pissed when it wakes up." It was easy to give her a grin in return.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh yes. That felt like it'll wake with a terrible hangover." she laughed almost hysterically. Twenty minutes later we were in sight of the train. It looked like my message had not been taken seriously The team was still scattered about the site merrily digging and carrying on.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Anton saw us and came running with Alisha in tow, "We tried to warn them but they didn't want to hear it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A red haze of anger filmed my eyes as I drew breath to shout. Just then Kali dashed from the trees into the clearing. "What the fuck is this? Weren't you warned? Get on the train right now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Lissa, start warning people you know, get them headed toward the train. Anton, you and Alisha do the same." I instructed in a calm but carrying voice.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Thomas, the official team leader puffed up and bellowed, "Hold it! I am in charge here. I would do nothing to endanger this mission however these new comers seek to panic us."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali drew breath to shout just as I saw a clot of figures break from the cover of the trees. "Kali, behind you!" She spun and drew energy. Thomas stood rooted to his spot as an energy bolt shattered the ground at his feet. "Everyone, fall back to the train." I ran a Thomas and shoved him out of the way as another ball clipped my back. Howling in pain I staggered to my feet as Kali let fly with a massive burst of energy. The grey figures dropped as one. Kali swayed and dropped to her knees a second later. Adrenalin sizzled through me as I flipped Thomas over and grabbed his shoulders. "Go get Kali and get her to the train."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Scared eyes looked back as he mumbled, "How could I know..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Get her now. Talk later." I hauled at him and screamed as the fire in my back flared again. Anton dashed from the train and hauled me in a fireman's carry to the train. Thomas came seconds later half dragging Kali. "Lissa, get the train moving..." It was a hiss through the pain as my vision swam. Blackness flickered at the edges of my sight. The train began to move as I finally surrendered and dropped into the comforting dark.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui, Ennui..." A voice kept sounding in the distance.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Want sleep."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui, come on, I need you to wake up."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sleep now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, Ennui, I need you awake."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I pried an eye open and looked into the face of Anton. "Prick," I mumbled.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I have one. You want to see it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I couldn't stop the giggles that prompted. "Ouch! Now see what you did?" I had wanted it to be teasing but it came out more like a whine.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good, now you are waking up. I need to check your shoulder and I didn't want that to be what woke you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">His words brought it all back. I struggled to sit as I asked, "Are we ok? Did we get everyone?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, everyone's ok. You're the worst of the lot. Kali's sleeping off whatever she did and Thomas is wanting to apologize as soon as you're ready." His fingers were moving as he spoke and a stab of pain followed. Gently he rolled me over and examined it. "Looks like you're going to be ok. No sign of infection or poison. Thank you for back there by the way. You did a great thing getting us all out alive." Swiftly he re bandaged it and settled me back onto the set of seats that had been rigged as a bed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ugh, how long have I been out?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Four hours. We passed Portal station an hour ago. We'll be in Death City in a few minutes. That was the other reason to wake you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I suppose I should give Thomas his chance now. It'll only get harder if I put it off. Could you help me sit up better? I don't want to be laying down for that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No weakness in front of the troops?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I couldn't tell from his voice if he was serious, mocking or teasing so I just said, "Nope. Must appear super-human at all times. Passing out kind of spoils that though..." I finished through a very shallow laugh which still hurt more than I had hoped.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You're doing ok with it I think." He finished propping me up with a big wad of pillows.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later Thomas came into view. He leaked nervousness and worry. "I, uh, I'm sorry about all that. I've never seen that kind of attack before. I didn't mean to put anyone in danger."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'd say it was ok, but it really isn't. You can't take those kinds of chances with people's lives."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But how was I to know it wasn't hysteria?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thomas," I tried to be as diplomatic as I could. Truthfully that was very hard when the actions had been so poorly thought out. "Thomas, if it were hysteria, don't you think you should have tried to find out why? The first thing we learned as kids, at least those of us with the circus, was you always look out for the others of your team. Together we are strong, apart we are weak."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I...I didn't..." His eyes turned slightly moist as he tried to explain, "Look, I was in charge because I can coordinate recovery actions pretty well. I'm not good when it comes to thinking about danger. I'm an archeologist, or at least I was. My skills are knowing what kinds of things are important from an artifact stand point. I didn't sign on for war."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"None of us did. I fear we may not have a choice right now though. I'm sorry this happened on your watch."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Next time..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Don't worry about next time. I suspect there'll be a debriefing on this if I know Merris. Things will get worked out and new policies decided after I think." Anton moved back and said, "Merris routed us around by the Cathouse. You can get off first. She said she'll come see you tomorrow about the debriefing. You rest tonight."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes sir, mister doctor sir."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He smiled and said, "And don't you forget it missy." He finished speaking as the train began to slow. Outside the window was the very welcome site of the Cathouse loading platform. The train pulled to a stop as the most welcome site of all came into view. There was Dementia standing on the platform nervously watching the windows. I stretched to wave and was hit with pain as damaged things were stretched. I hissed in pain and waved anyway.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She wave back. Within moments she had me wrapped in a careful hug. Kisses followed until Anton coughed slightly. "You know she'd be more comfortable and easier to get to if she were inside."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia blushed her really cute blush and helped me up. I gave Anton a last smile as we walked slowly from the train. As we passed some of the others the clapped and called out thanks. It was my turn to blush at that. Dementia commented loudly, "My very own hero. Eat it up guys." I didn't think I could turn any more red until she said that.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We went straight to our rooms where she settled me in bed and then climbed in to join me. "I've arranged for the others to take care of the club tonight. We are going to have ourselves a nice long healing trance. And then you get a proper welcome back." It wasn't very long until I tumbled down into sleep.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Late the next day I woke with warm arms around me. Smiling like a fool I cuddled close, noticing the healing had worked well once again. When sleepy brown eyes opened next to me I smiled and kissed the nose between them. Much later I padded to the kitchen to re-enact the most important ritual ever invented, the creation of a good pot of coffee. The skin and muscles in my shoulder were still tight, however the nagging pain was gone. Coffee in hand I returned to the bedroom and had Dementia unwrap the bandages. She pronounced it healed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We spent the last of the daylight sitting while I told her about the mission. I had just finished when there was a knock at the door. Standing outside were Kali and Merris. Waving them in I offered coffee and then we all returned to the comfortable chairs.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris asked the first questions and once again I found myself explaining what had happened. This time in much more detail. I saw Kali raise her eyebrows at my description of how I got the small group off the hill side.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So I'm not the only one," she mumbled.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The only one that what?" I asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That gets things just appearing in their thoughts."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia laughed at that, "Goddess, no. I've had things popping into my head since I got here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I get the basic dispatch data in a similar way. I know where to route the trains and the tracks are there. It isn't more thought out than that some times."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know why I didn't see this one though," Dementia said slowly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris hastened to reassure her, "You haven't seen them all, ever, have you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, but...but someone I really..." she started to say through sudden tears.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's the hardest part I find. When I have to send someone I know out into the unknown. It never gets easier and I don't ever get visions about the dangers they may face." Her eyes drifted to Kali even though they weren't sitting together. A knowing smile tried to flicker on my face but I held it back as hard as I could. Still, I think Dementia saw it cause she gave me a tiny little nod. "You won't always know."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But it's only going to get worse and I can't see if the people," Dementia's voice broke and she continued in a choked whisper, "the people I care about will survive the coming war."</p>
