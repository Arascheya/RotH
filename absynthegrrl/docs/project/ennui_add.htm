<p class="regtxt5">Ennui stepped off the bus in downtown. Immediately the memories overwhelmed her. Even before her parents saw her she began to regret this trip. "Anna, over here! Oh my god, what have you done to your hair?" Her mother waved and yelled. For the first time she wished she'd managed to get all the color washed out before coming home. The stares on the bus were fun, but the lecture she was sure to get now wouldn't be.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mama, da, hi. Where's Cindy?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The school dance. Seems she has some of your habits, although she is more studious. I still can't believe you're wasting your time on theater instead of medicine."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't want to be a nurse. I don't cope well with sick people."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But there's no future in theater. Your mother figured that out when she left the circus."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Da, that's not true. The circus had to add a second unit to handle all the requests for shows and smaller circuses are starting up everywhere." She stared back into his angry look. "I am glad the two of you got together, and I love Cindy too. It's just I miss my friends. I miss the thrill of the show. Most of all I miss the travel. Can't you understand? Not everyone is meant to settle down."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Anna, I had my time being wild with the circus and I outgrew it. I don't want you to have to go through the same things I did."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mama, what did you go through? We had friends and I was learning things besides the boring stuff they crammed at me in the schools here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now don't you start. We tried to give you a good life..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And you did. You really did in a lot of ways. I just don't want to settle down. I see some of the others at university already giving away their options chasing security. I understand the desire, but the cost seems way too high!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now my dear, how many times have I tried to tell you that life isn't always about what you want."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know da, but can't it be once in a while?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now Anna, we've had these conversations every time you come home. Could we just leave it for now?" Her mom pleaded.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok mama, let's go home. I'd like to wash the trip off and get one of your good meals as well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* in main - fix transition point at end of first person section - make more seamless and maybe shorten conversation - convey issues without being verbose */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* just after arrival */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So, now I'm here, what does it mean? What about my family and friends?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You can go back. I still envy you Walkers that, those of you who can move between the worlds. You can go back and tell them you are alright. It's just when you do, that's it. The door closes and you are remain in the Realms until you die. The you most often go to the afterlife. The chances rarely come more than once."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean? I'm alive right?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, however we are not to be known of. You cannot reveal this to the Relams, not in a way that could be believed anyway. Like heaven, hell, and all the other afterlifes we can't let the not dead yet know about it."</p>
