<p class="pagecaption">Chapter 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was through my job at the library that I was finally able to decipher the diary that had been found with me in the burned wreckage of the Hadresson homestead. The homestead had been the place of my early childhood. Mary's family had adopted me after the fire that killed the rest of my family. I had been found in the cellar, slightly burnt, but mostly buried under half burned parts of the upper floors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">No one had told me how the fire had started. I was five at the time and had only dim memories of my life before the blaze. As I read through the diary, it became clear that the church had burned my home, with my family in it, because they were "satanic, evil creatures" that could not be allowed to walk among the faithful. Anna, my mother and the author of the diary, had few details to add, other than my sister Iris had turned in the family. They had planned to run, but the church had acted too quickly, surrounding the house and firing shots at any who tried to step outside.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Most of it seemed like crazy talk. It told of my parents arrival at the homestead through a magic mirror and how they had built the homestead on the spot. They had paid vast sums to the local headman to submit their deeds and titles through the proper channels to establish credibility with the church. Mary's family had worked the next farmstead over and had been one of the few families to actually accept mine. Anna was quite impressed by Marta's welcoming nature. Anna spoke of fleeing political problems in a place called Sphere. Her descriptions were vague, but it sounded like a fantasy place, impossible to exist if the church was right.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was standing in the upper bathroom, staring into the mirror, with a small blade at my throat. If the diary was to be believed, there was a small gold amulet buried in the flesh at the base of my neck. It kept me from assuming my true form and let me pass as a child of this world. I was eighteen, working at the library, barely tolerated by the church, and craving adventure. If it hadn't been for that, I wouldn't be considering cutting into my own neck.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The blade trembled as I brought it to the spot, pressed firmly, and drew it in a half inch motion. A sharp hiss of pain burst from me, but a tiny gold gleam peeked from within the cut. It took several tries to get the tweezers into the cut and around the object. Tears were streaming down my face and the wound burned with a harsh fire by the time I pulled it out. Shock was darkening my vision as I dropped onto the commode. The object fell to the floor and warmth shoved back the darkness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I watched my flesh melt and flow, trying but not succeeding in stifling the scream that tore from my throat. Terror drew the darkness again and I was barely able to stay conscious.  Black bat-wings sprouted from my shoulders, softness melted from my face and body, leaving a lean, hard-edged woman staring at me from the mirror. My vision, hearing, and sense of smell sharpened and the wound in my neck closed to a fine white scar as I watched. My hair, which was normally blonde, had turned jet black. I flexed the wings and watched, fascinated, as they expanded. They were warm, with a soft, leathery feel to the touch. I ran naked from the bathroom to my room, threw open the window, climbed out onto the porch roof and leapt off. They caught wind and I glided gently to the ground.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fear clutched at me and I rapidly scanned the area to make sure no one had seen me. Mary, Steve, and the children had gone to town, but they might have come back or a neighbor might have come by to see me. When I saw no one, I darted to the barn, climbed to the highest loft, opened the access door and leapt again. This time I flapped my wings and whooped with delight as they caught wind and lifted me into the currents, swooping and diving between the trees and around the house. I longed to climb higher, but was afraid of the neighbors down the road. At last I glided back to the house, folded my wings behind me, and walked back to the bathroom. Curious what would happen, I reached out and picked up the amulet. Coolness swept through me as my wings disappeared and my face and body filled back out to my usual look. The tiny white scar remained at the base of my throat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The amulet had to be touching my skin to work. I had tried touching it through cloth to see if I could just carry it in my pocket.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Reality hit with a crash. What could I tell Mary and Steve? "Hi lovers, guess what I found out...", "Umm, you'll never guess what Anna's diary said...", nothing came to mind that would work. I cut a small strip of tape from the roll in the medicine cabinet and taped the amulet to my side before slipping back into my clothes. If this part of the diary had been right, maybe the rest of it was as well. It was a sobering thought. If it were true, then my parents had been what the church had called them before burning them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary found me sitting in the kitchen, staring at the diary on the table in front of me. One look at my face and she crossed to me and pulled me into a tight hug. "What is it? What's wrong?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you do when you find out something you based your life on isn't true?" my voice sounded hollow and empty, even to me. I hesitated for a bit, then pushed the diary aside and handed her the papers from underneath. "I finished translating the diary I was found with and..." my voice trailed into silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure you want me to read this?" Mary asked, seeing the scared look that followed the pages in her hands.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should know. Just, well, it's pretty horrible and I'm scared to death of what it means for me, for us, for everything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She leaned back when she was done and said, "Oh, come on, this can't be true." She looked at my scared expression and continued, "Can it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need to show you something. Can we go to the barn? I'm not ready for the kids to see this." She nodded slowly and followed behind me. Once we were inside, I made sure the door was closed, stripped off my top and bra, then pulled the tape loose. I held out the amulet to her and watched as she slowly reached for it. Once I released it, the change happened again. Mary gasped and staggered back, fear momentarily etched on her face. She swept it aside, stepped closer again and looked at me. Very slowly she walked all the way around me while I stood terrified at what she had to be thinking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May I touch them?" she asked when she was facing me again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your wings."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I nodded slowly. Her hand reached out and softly brushed against the skin of my left wing. It felt so good that I couldn't stop the low moan, deep in my throat. "Does that feel good?" She asked, then smiled wickedly when I whispered a soft yes. She slid closer, stroking her fingers up and down the skin of my wing, sending shivers of delight zipping through me. "They're so soft and warm," She said softly, moving even closer, until her breath was hot on my neck. "Do they work?" she whispered in my ear before nipping at the sensitive section of it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," I whispered again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stepped away quickly, shed her top, and stepped close again. "Can you wrap them around me?" I shifted slightly and managed to get them to wrap around us. She moaned softly in my ear as she nipped it again. "Oh, yes! God, they feel wonderful!" Her hands slipped around my waist, dropped, and cupped my ass, hauling me tight against her. Her mouth dropped to my neck and she began licking and sucking the very sensitive spots, driving me crazy with lust. I grabbed the waistband of her skirt and shoved it down her legs, following with her panties. The scent of her hit me like a wave, bringing a low growl from me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary fumbled with the belt on my work pants and slid them down, then grabbed my panties and shoved them down as well. Her hands returned to my ass, lightly scratching over my skin, sending waves of excitement up my spine. I wrapped one hand around her ass and lightly pinched at her nipples with the other. She moaned into my ear as she returned to nipping at it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She slid slowly down, kissing her way to my breasts, rolling my stiff tips between her teeth and flicking the ends with her tongue. Her kisses drifted lower until she reached the top of my slit. Her tongue pushed gently at the top of my folds, then she sucked my inner lips into her mouth, grabbed them softly with her teeth and tugged.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My knees buckled and I sagged to the floor. Mary followed me down without loosing contact. She released my lips and flicked her tongue over my clit as she shoved two fingers deep inside me. I clenched down hard as my back arched. My hands pulled at her as I unfolded my wings. "Give me your pussy. I need you!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She swung around an I fastened my mouth over her lips. She was wet and delicious. I shoved my tongue as far into her as I could and wrapped my wings over her. By flexing various muscles I could move them back and forth over her skin. I screamed into her cunt as I came in shuddering waves. The vibrations took her over the edge seconds later. Not satisfied, I started licking and tonguing her again. After a few ragged breaths of her own, she returned to licking and nipping my clit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several shattering orgasms later we lay together on the floor while our breathing returned to normal. I kept a protective wing wrapped over Mary, to keep her from getting cold. "So, you think the rest of the diary is true too?" she finally asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Considering how odd this is, yes, I do. I was going to go look for the portal mirror in the Hadresson's well after it gets dark. What do I do now? What about Steve and the kids? Do I dare show them this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She kissed me softly before replying, "Yes. I think Steve would be ok and the kids, well, they'll think its great, especially if you could carry them and still fly. Remember, they like those banned fantasy books from the empire. Besides, they already have to keep quiet about our poly amorous living arrangements. Just the fact you sleep with Steve and I would get all of us burned. I always wondered who gave your parents to the church."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't think I'm evil because of this? I hate the church and all it stands for, yet I've absorbed enough that this is freaking me out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ara, I have been your friend since we were five and your lover since we were twelve. This is just another change we have to figure out." She pressed the amulet back into my hand. "Here, stick this back on yourself, get dressed, and lets go see if that mirror exists. Then we can tell Steve and the kids what's going on. I'll be right back. I'm going to let Steve know it's his turn to do dinner tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Mary returned, I grabbed one of the large hand lights from the barn and we made the 2 kilometer trek to the burned out Hadresson place. Skeletal fingers of charred and rotting wood were all that remained of the barn and house. A low mound, covered in long grass and weeds, held the locked steel door leading to the well and pumps. The combination lock I had placed on the well several years ago was still intact, although rusty and pitted. It took several tries to get the dial turning freely enough to allow me to enter the correct numbers and yank it open. Rusty metal squealed in protest but finally released with a sharp pop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was two hundred fifty meters down the narrow, rotting, spiral stairs to the second stage pump and the tank that was supposed to hold the mirror we were looking for. The stairs wound down around a central opening where equipment could be raised and lowered. They started out rotting concrete and turned into mineral slimed stone about 50 meters down. The wood of the railings had long since rotted away in the dank moisture, leaving the edge of the stairs uncomfortably close. Wells near the Hadresson farm and on my parents farm had to be dug with two pumps because water was about five hundred meters down and a single pump wasn't enough to draw it up. My family would be paying off the cost of our well for another three or four generations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I fumbled through the sequence of bolt twisting on the front of the second tank once we reached it. Mary and I both gasped in surprise when the front section of the tank swung open to reveal an ornate mirror leaning against the back of it. The mirror was clear and bright, with a shimmering, slippery looking surface. Gold leaf gilded the intricate carvings of the frame depicting strange creatures hunting each other in a constant parade around the mirror. "That, that would take us to another place if we touched it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," I replied, hesitantly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary's eyes shone with excitement, "Shall we see if it works?" She wet her hand with the mineral soup from the stairs and approached the mirror. Before I could answer, she touched the surface and stared as her hand went right through. "Are you coming?" she asked as she eased forward.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait. It's getting late and Steve will start to wonder. Besides, I think it would be better to go through in my other form but I don't want to go half naked."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary reluctantly pulled her hand back from the mirror. "Ok, but tomorrow morning then, early, so we have some time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Steve must have been watching because he met us at the door. I had been eager to tell him, to get everything resolved, but seeing him, remembering all the good times, stopped me. I told myself after dinner I would talk to him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dinner was good, but when Steve cooked, it always was. After dinner there were stories from the kids about things they'd seen in town. Then Steve related the results of our latest sales. For once we were doing well in terms of crops and the market for them. I would have tried to not say anything about my discoveries if Mary hadn't forced my hand. "It wasn't all quiet around here either. Ara has something to tell us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, uh, that is..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary got up, moved around behind me, and started rubbing on my shoulders. "It'll be ok, lover," she whispered into my ear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I translated that old diary..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, what did it say?" Steve asked as he leaned forward when I hesitated again. I went to the small room we used for paperwork and grabbed the translated pages. I read them aloud to Steve and the children while Mary continued to rub my shoulders.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Steve was looking skeptical when I finished and the children were mesmerized. "Let's see, momma Ara," Astrid asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok. Let me change clothes first. In our room I slipped out of my clothes and into a tied on sun-suit top. I hoped it wouldn't interfere with my wings when I shifted form. By the time I returned to the living area, I was extremely nervous.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that the amulet?" Astrid asked, pointing at the strip of tape on my side.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes it is," I replied. I pulled the tape loose and dropped the amulet to the floor. The children gasped as I shifted form, then closed in to look closer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can we touch your wings?" Deven asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just be gentle, they're very sensitive." They poked and prodded at my wings, but they were careful about it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My teacher was talking about confession today," Astrid said while still examining my wings. "She wants all of us to go and tell anything about our families."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What kinds of things?" Mary asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything that isn't according to church law. Anything from lustful comments about another person to strange relationships. She singled me out after class to ask about Ara and how she fits with our family."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are you going to do, honey?" Steve asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Confess some little things, like how Deven makes me so angry and how Noah gets too much attention," her face screwed up in anger as she suddenly shouted, "I hate them! I hate the stupid...fucking...church and their god damned priests! I hate the way the make us feel dirty and ashamed and cursed, shoving their craziness at us day after fucking day!" Her face turned white, "Oh shit, oh shit! I didn't mean to say those words."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wrapped my wings around her without thinking and murmured, "I know sweety, I know!" Mary wrapped both of us in her arms and repeated the same assurances. Steve held Deven, Noah, and reached for Mary's hand. We stayed wrapped together for a long while before slowly separating. We sat together in a close circle on the floor and held hands, none of us wanting to be very far from our family.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We found the mirror," Mary said after a long silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You what?" Steve asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ara and I found the mirror of the diary pages and it was a door to another place, just like the diary said."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We could go there! We could leave here and escape the church!" Astrid's voice shook with excitement.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute, Astrid. Remember what the diary said. Sphere isn't a safe place. You'd have to leave your friends, the farm, your cat, and the horses. What would happen to them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you're going to go, aren't you, mama Ara?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes Astrid. I have to find out what I am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's simple. You're one of my moms. What more do you need to know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What I am, whether I'm dangerous to all of you, and what the diary means."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Grandpa Frank and Grandpa Evan could take care of the farm. Just like they did when momma Mary and Steve were sick last year and you couldn't keep up with the farm and your job in town. We could go and come back if things were too bad, right? You can come back, right? You won't be leaving us, will you?" She started to cry and threw herself at me, wrapping her arms around me and holding on tight. "Don't leave us!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They have their own farms to take care of. It wouldn't be right to ask them to take over ours too," Mary replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The conversation went late into the evening with nothing decided. Astrid wanted to go, even with all the problems. The boys were curious, but not as frustrated as Astrid. Mary, Steve, and I tried to not make any rash decisions in the face of Astrid's wants. It was long past dusk when we put the children to bed and settled into our own large bed. I started to tape the amulet back in place when Mary shook her head, "You are beautiful this way too. Could you leave the amulet off for tonight?" I set the amulet back on the nightstand and rolled back toward them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* insert love-making scene here */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can take care of the kids today and work on the nearer fields. I know you want to check the mirror today," Steve said over breakfast. Mary and I looked at each other, then hugged him tight. "Just promise you won't stay too long and that I get a chance to see it too, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," we replied as one voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
