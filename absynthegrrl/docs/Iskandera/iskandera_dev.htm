<p class="sectioncaption">Things to remember throughout</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Iska is a one-dim, for one dimensional, entering the planes - somehow she will need to figure out how the multi-verse really works. Since she was questioning anyway, it will be easier for her to accept the proxy god concepts and realities. If she ever returns, she'll be a planar in a one-dim place.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is an <a href="../../gm_resources/monsters/demons/demon_alu_fiend.htm">Alu-Demon</a> and has <a href="../../gm_resources/monsters/demons/tanar_ri.htm">Tanar'ri</a> capabilities: Darkness - 5 meter radius, Teleport without error, Infravision, Telepathy, Charm Person, Danger Sense - 75%, Dimension Door (once per day), ESP, Natural Armor of AC5 from tough skin, Shape Change (to a humanoid form of approximately their own height and weight only), and Suggestion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Suppression Amulet will negate all of the above except for the immunities to damage types, based on the <a href="../../gm_resources/monsters/demons/tanar_ri.htm">Tanar'ri</a> capabilities, and natural AC, Her Danger Sense will be reduced to 25%.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Things to consider revising</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>


</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">planet is a rock - dry, to the point of almost impossible to live on, suitable only for large area grazing of meat creatures and small gardens. management is done through horses and physical labor. The colony is too poor to afford higher tech and the power systems necessary to run it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The settlers came from a group seeking religious freedom. In their case, freedom to oppress using their dominant religion. It dominates all aspects of colonial life and has driven significant numbers of the young to direct or indirect suicide, although, no official documentation will ever mention that fact.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Iskandera's adoptive family had to drive a two stage well to get at the water far below their land. They will be several more generations paying off the high-tech equipment and access chamber half way to the water table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The old town doc died when Ara was really young. The new doc, Simon Shierba, came a bit before that. He remembers life on other worlds and will reluctantly talk about them with Ara after her twelth birthday and once she knows enough to ask.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ara started wondering at eight, when things didn't seem to make sense in the religious doctrine she was being fed. after finding the stuff in the burned farm she really started to question and somehow found a way around the doc's defenses, getting him to talk about life elsewhere</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Centrys faction has a Keeper's Ring and a captive Gatherer. They are trying to find out more about what they are, the place they were found, and through them, about the Balance Keeper. Irishkah and her partner heard about the items from someone who would pay a fortune to see them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The ring is the color of the Portal into Eternia and the Gatherer looks like a ghostly spider. It is desperately trying to slip away and continue its purpose. The ring will place a very strong geas on any who wear it to return it to Eternia. Once returned, the being will stay on the Sacred Units and be whisked away, never to be seen again. They will be beyond scrynig, divination, or any form of soul recovery.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">her father died when she was twenty, from illness</p>

<p class="regtxt5">she talked her mother into fleeing/leaving with the captain of the Durka, because she saw they were in love</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She has been friends with Mary since they started school together. Mary was her first kiss, her first sexual encounter, and remains her best friend. Steve Timmons was her first boy, and Mary's first boy. They share each other from the time they first make love until Ara leaves through the gate. Ara's parents knew of her love of sex, supported her, and made sure she had the tools to avoid unwanted complications. These included anit-fertility drugs and a Companion grade medical scanner - detects STDs and similar things in a potential mate by skin, temperature, and sweat analysis. Ara will commission one for Mary by the time they are twenty. Ara and Mary start fooling around with each other when they are twelve. At thirteen they bring Steve into the mix. Ara is the foward one, noticing he is shy, good looking, and sweet. They talk to him for a while and get to know a bit about him before Ara stops him near the bus stop one day with, "We'll show you ours if you'll show us yours. Tell your folks your staying with a friend or working on a school project, then get off at my stop." Because of her parents, Ara, Steve, and Mary can use Ara's room, rather than some place more exposed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ara leaves when she is twenty-eight. Something has come hunting and she fears for Steve, Mary, and their three children. She has always told Steve she would like children some day, if they could be his. Mary is agreeable to this as well. Decide if she gets a chance to make good on this before her final adventure to the Drkzyrkth worlds. The children know of the strange three way marriage of the adults and, somehow, have managed to never speak of it. At the time Ara leaves the girl, Astrid, is eleven, the oldest boy, Deven, seven, and the youngest boy, Noah, is five. Steve and Mary will remain as a regular couple until/unless Ara returns. If she does, they will resume their three person marriage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider upping the ages slightly - to get Astrid to 13, Deven 11, and Noah as 7 - gives Astrid a bit more knowledge about sexuality and makes it even more likely some of her classmates are being molested</p>

<p class="regtxt5">use the cavern from the first dream as a shrine/sanctuary set up by the Hadressons. It was not found or burned by the church. Use some concept of the trying to protecther family, set things right, from the time-looping dream for the reason she has to leave her family. (Steve, Mary, and the kids). The shrine should provide the final clue to Anna's diary and how to access the gate. Maybe there could be something about a contact or two in Centrys she could talk to, something so she isn't going in completely cold.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider - maybe Ara gets to the Drkzrkth world through some techno finding by archeologists in the Empire. Maybe she, Steve, and Mary have relocated to an Empire world after she returns from Centrys. She could be a respected archeologist because of knowledge from Centrys and subsequent finds in the Empire. If a team went to the Drkzyrkth world through a gate as part of a legitimate find, there could be members of the team seeking to monetize either the artifacts or hoping to use the lost tech to gain power. In either case, Ara can't allow the tech to be taken and fall into the wrong hands. Only through the vampyrites reactivating her was she able to contain the tech. Then she ends up through a final gate in Angelique's/Mereret's time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The control necklace didn't help her because she had found it after she had gone mostly mad and she had taken a serious amount of brain damage when she was killed, before the vampyrites had invaded her system.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talking to Irishkah, shortly after arrival</p>

<p class="regtxt9">/* somehow they end up talking about "god" from Ara's world</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ara: I'm not even sure there really is a god, and if there is, why would it give a shit about what I think?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Iri: There are three.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Ara: Three?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Iri: Three gods, greater beings, powers that run the multi-verse, whatever you'd like to call them. And you're right, they don't care about the affairs of us. Most often they are called the Three Sisters. One is Stability, one is Possibility, and the final one is Balance. Then there are the godlings. They are things created by the energies of their worshippers. If your god exists, it would be one of those. They tend to be nasty, cruel, and capricious. Little recommends their worship, yet many races still feel the need. Some interfere in their worlds, some do not. And they fight mercilessly with each other using their worshippers as proxies.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">picking the other 6 targets and why they were chosen - some ideas:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">targets are abusers of the worst sort and protected by social standings</p>

<p class="regtxt12">the targets are after her either because of the local power structure or something from Centrys</p>

<p class="regtxt12">mix of the two - best option</p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider Asylum Flowers for the name of the brothel where Arascheya works while in Sphere. Asylim Flowers is located at the upper "point" edge of the Market Ward. This places it at the upper "point convergence" of the five wards. Consider the kinkiness of a coffee bean pool, where patrons or workers can frolic in fresh roasted coffee beans.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">look up Parker and sophie from leverage - Parker for Mary concept</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider using some of these concepts elsewhere throughout the story */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was another door, to the side of this room, just visible in the light filtering back from the street. I slipped toward it, not wanting to be spotted right away. After a moment of hesitation, Mary came along with me. The door opened into a small alcove off another street. The sounds were louder here and the scent of roasted meat drifted by. A voice to my right caught our attention, "A demonic and a humanish, that's a rare sight, even for Sphere." A dirty urchin in ratty clothes looked up at us. She, or he, it was impossible to tell under the grime and from the lack of age, waited a moment and asked, "Is she your property?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No! We are..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lovers," Mary interjected.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lovers? That's very enlightened for single dims," the child laughed at our puzzled looks and explained, "Single Dims are from a realm, not from Sphere. Newcomers might be another word, though most single dims aren't interested in the what of Sphere, only in escaping back to where they came from. What about you? You typical or open? I can give you the what of the place for a bit of scratch."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um, we, er, what is this scratch?" Mary asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The urchin rolled its eyes and replied, "Money, scratch, coin, value, whatever you trade in the place you are from."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That would be good, Would this be enough?" I said, reaching into a pocket and pulling out a small bit of our money.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you tell me of your realm as we go. I want to learn about as many as I can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What should we call you?" Mary asked. "I don't feel right with 'hey you'."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can call me Alys." She took us around the Great Souk, the marketplace where we had arrived. Hours passed as we wandered the narrow streets, some under high ceilings, some under cloth banners, and some open to the sky. When we stopped, staring up at the sky the first time we saw it, Alys explained about Sphere. Sphere was actually a Sphere, with the city in the inside walls. Looking up would let you see across the sky to the city on the far side. A tiny sun floated at the center of the sphere, lightening and darkening to give day, night, and heat to the city. A nameless being ruled the city, known only as She Who Must Never Be Named. This ruler was never seen, had no palace or throne, but would ruthlessly destroy any threat to the city."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">With a final deep breath I touched the mirror with the small brass ring that would open it and waited as the mirror shimmered and melted, changing to a rippling wavy surface. Thick, chill silver tendrils clung briefly to me as I stepped into the mirror.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stepped out into a dimly lit shop. Flickering lamps barely illuminated the thick tapestries hanging on the walls. Several mirrors rested in floor stands next to the one I had emerged from. The ceiling was soot blackened wood, darker where the poorly trimmed wicks of the lamps guttered smoke.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Eh ewe, mmm?" a frog-faced, squat thing asked me from behind a short counter. Startled, I stepped back. The ring must have hit the mirror because I fell flat on my back in the fake tank in the Hadresson's well. Anna's diary had spoken of strange things through the gate, but it hadn't prepared me for the reality of it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I could leave, walk up the stairs and back into the world. Back to the drudgery, the religion in everything, the stares and put downs for being one who had questioned. The gate would always be here, my secret way of escape if it ever got bad enough.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My feet were on the stairs when I stopped. Who was I kidding? I'd never try again, not if I left. Once again I stepped through the mirror and tried not to react when the creature once more asked, "Eh ewe, mmm?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I..I don't know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It nodded with what might have been a smile on its face, "ae, ah oon, ih eh." It disappeared through a curtain behind it and was gone for several minutes. A tall woman followed it when it came back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hello. I'm Irishkah. May I help you?" Her words were formal and stilted, like she didn't speak my language often. At first I had thought she was like me until she moved further into the dim light and I saw the small horns on her head, the reddish irises of her eyes, and the complicated amber tattoos running along her cheek bones. Her grey hair stood up from her head in a spiky tangle, odd but exotic as well. She was disturbing and fascinating at the same time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um, I'm, I don't know where to start..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How about your name?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kan...Iskandera," I answered, making it up on the spot, not wanting to be Kanda any more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Iskandera," it rolled off her tongue, sounding almost exotic. "You have stepped into the Sphere, or Centrys, to be more correct. Should I assume you know little of where you are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I nodded, suddenly suspicious. "What do you want from me for your help?" She looked a bit devilish and everyone knew devils always wanted payment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She threw back her head and laughed. "I am a traveler, like yourself. What I want is to learn about other places. What do you think I am?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I blushed deep red at that and tried to answer, "I...uh you...ummm...I don't know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you thought you did, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In...in my world you'd be a...a devil..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, some of my kind aren't very nice. I'm sure some of your kind aren't either. I am a tiefling, for what it's worth. I am sort of nice and embarrassed by some of my kind. What do you call your kind?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, human, I guess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That seems to be a common term among those that look like you. What brought you here? Not many of your kind come and stay."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I despise my world. I found a diary of another who had come here and I was curious. Maybe here would be better than there and if I died, maybe it would still be better than there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She cocked her head at that. "Don't be so eager to meet death. Some of her forms are nasty. Are you going to stay or go back through your gate?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stay," I said hesitantly, then more strongly, "Stay! But I don't know what to do here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She laughed again. "Same as anywhere else. Scrounge money, find a place to stay, and get food."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe I should just go back then," panic and uncertainty boiled up in my mind. I hadn't thought about what would be beyond the gate, just finding the gate had been enough. Anna hadn't said much about what she did beyond the gate, just some of what she had seen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And miss the grand adventures you could have? You are in Sphere, the center of the multi-verse. From here there are gates to countless places, some hostile, some wondrous, all full of strange new experiences. Would "back" offer you that?" She looked a bit embarrassed herself as she continued, "Besides, I could use some help and you'd be perfect."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was so absurd I had to laugh at that. "You are joking, right? I barely had enough skills to live where I came from. What could I possibly offer you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're a one-dim, a person from a world not familiar with the multi-verse." Her look turned vaguely calculating. "I need someone that will be under-estimated to enter a certain place and look around. They'll notice you, but not think anything of it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Suspicion returned in force. "So you do want something. And how dangerous will this be?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ummm..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know what, thanks but no thanks. I don't think I want your help that badly." I turned toward the mirror.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait! Just hear me out, let me explain." I turned back to her, fixing her with a neutral stare. "Ok, look, there's a lot to understand about this place and it would take a very long time to explain it. I'm going to give you a really quick look at the what of Centrys. There are many factions, each with their own leaders and objectives. They fight and squabble, but only to a certain level. Anything that threatens Centrys will immediately be squashed by She Who Must Never Be Named, the true power of the city. No one sees her, or if they do, they don't live to tell the tale. Gods of any form are not allowed in the Sphere. As a result they send in proxies to try and influence events in the city. All of them want access because Centrys truly stands at the center of the multi-verse. The one who controls the city controls access to anywhere. So far none who have opposed She.. have survived, yet they still try from time to time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"One faction captured a friend of mine and is holding her hostage to encourage me to steal an item from another faction. Sounds simple enough on the surface, but I learned what they wanted and what they planned and it convinced me the job was a bad thing. I want help freeing my friend, but I can't get close to the faction areas without being recognized."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I still don't understand how I could help. If I start asking questions, won't they just expel or kill me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had thought to place you in the tavern closest to their headquarters as a server and hope they'd let something slip. Servers are almost invisible and one-dims even more so. One-dims don't know the what of Centrys, so aren't involved. The danger would only come if they suspected you were working for someone as a spy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had been with too many lovers to not hear the lies in her words and enough lovers to know the type of them. "You seem nice enough, yet you insist on lying to me. If you want my help, that is fine, but I won't help if you lie about it." It was a back-handed complement in a way, I hoped she was smart enough to take it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her eyes narrowed as she asked, "Why do you think that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am not a good person by my world's view. I lay with people for money, for influence, and because I like it. A good person would only do so for children, or to please the male of their house. I have been with enough people to know when they are evading or lying to me. It only matters when it effects me, and this will effect me. I may refuse you if I don't like the goals, but you won't shock me if it is against local laws."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She looked me over with an appraising look. Starting with my tall and lean frame, the plain oval face with green eyes and lines at the corners. The hard set of my mouth, eyes, and face, the tangled mop of shortish blonde hair and my hands resting, slightly flexed, below the long sleeves of my shirt. I smiled coldly and shrugged to pull the right sleeve up enough that she could see the knife ready to drop into my hand. "I don't intimidate that easily, one-dim."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No intimidation. Just stop messing with me. If you want help, level with me, otherwise, leave me alone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You aren't tough enough for here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe not, but I wouldn't go down alone," I said through a predatory smile. The one that had backed down many an over-eager man on my world. "I would like friends here, but there has to be trust, which means truth."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She looked a long time before saying, "Little of it is true. There is no partner held captive, but there is an item I want to steal from one of the faction houses. It isn't very major, just worth enough to keep me in food and housing for another month or two, until I can line up another commission. The need for a watcher is in the brothel near the faction house, not in a bar. I didn't want to tell you that up front in case you would be unwilling to enter such a place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I'll help you." I gave her a more genuine smile and said, "Was that so hard?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anger snapped for a moment in her eyes, then dimmed as she laughed, "One-dim kitten thinks she has claws. I hope you are as good as you think you are. Mmmglgglu, I'm going to need that back room a bit longer." The frog-creature nodded slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I followed her slowly into the back room. Boxes were stacked everywhere, shelves were bolted to the walls, and a small table with several chairs huddled near the door on the far side of the room. Now that we weren't fighting I had a chance to look at her. Her body screamed sex. She was taller than me by a couple of inches. Her shoulders were wide and strong, her waist narrow but muscular, and her ass and legs were to die for. She moved with an unconscious grace that had me hot, wet, and almost drooling. When she turned to sit I felt her eyes on me. It was almost impossible to not strip out of my clothes and parade in front of her. Instead, I settled into the other chair, blushing hotly at my thoughts, and hoping she wouldn't notice. She smiled as she licked her lips, shifting in her chair so I could get a good look at her cleavage in the tight, short leather vest she wore. "We need to plan how to get you close to the faction headquarters."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, we should. I need to know more about how things work here, too." I was silently cursing myself for going with modest clothing for a change. I slid a hand down, undid the fly on my thick pants, and fanned them to try and cool myself. Her nostrils flared as she caught my scent and it was my turn to smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So kitten, have you killed in your safe little world?" her voice was less controlled and more husky.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," I replied, thinking of the first one. He had tried to jump me in a back alley and have his way. The keys in my hand had been enough to tear out his throat, but the blood had gone everywhere. And he hadn't stopped as fast as they showed in the entertainments. He had managed to break my jaw on his way down. Afterwards, the police were still going to charge me. All the witnesses were women and everyone knew I was asking for it by dressing slightly provocatively and being in that part of town. One of his brothers had come forward at my trial and testified that my assailant had done this many times. It was just enough to change the verdict to justifiable homicide.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really? More than once?" Her eyebrows had raised in surprise and she had leaned farther forward.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I made a show of staring at her cleavage, stretching back, and letting my hands pull my shirt tight over my curves. How I could be so turned on talking about killing didn't make any sense. "Six, no seven, times." I had almost forgotten the time I had to take two at once.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What were they?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean, what were they?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Demons, devils, something else?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, they were just like me, only monsters," I leaned back to the table as I explained and my hand brushed her arm. An electric shock blasted through me and I grabbed her head, planting a fierce kiss on her surprised lips. She grabbed my arms and we struggled free of the chairs. I grabbed her ass, shoved my right thigh between hers, and wrapped my legs around her thigh. One of her arms wrapped around my back while her other hand twined through my hair and held my mouth on hers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We rode each other until I pulled my mouth away to scream in passion. She followed me a few seconds later. We collapsed into a tangle on the floor, panting and sweating, but still kissing, although more tenderly now.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you have a room?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why are we still here?" I would see the streets of Centrys later, but this time all I saw was her next to me, her hand warm in mine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She started to pull at the laces of her vest as soon as we were inside. I held her hands and said, "Let me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">I hastily grabbed her hand and let her pull me along. The mirror was a cold line across my skin. The blackness beyond a screaming fire-brand of heat, then we were through.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The sound hit first, pounding down on us in waves of voices, shouts, animals, and music. Next came the smells, sweat, grilled meat, spices, animals, heat, and dust. Sight came last, after our eyes recovered from the blackness. Swirling groups of people, strange beings, animals, carts, all jostling and bumping together in the narrow street in front of us. Behind us was a small alcove in a wall of black stone. Above was an arched vault of a roof, stretching along the street. Stalls lined the way, filed with spices of innumerable varieties and scents.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary slid closer, wrapping her arm around my waist. "Is this Sphere?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is the Great Souk, grandmother of all markets, in all realms, set in the Trade Ward of Sphere. You must be new. I can help you with the what of Sphere, for a small amount of compensation, of course," said a small, thin voice from my right. I turned to find an urchin girl, dirty, rag draped, but smiling, staring back at us.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, what would you take for your help? I suppose our money wouldn't be of value," Mary said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Information has value. For example, how you got here, where you are from, and is the door one way or two way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Two way, but it goes to a really boring, ugly place," Mary replied before I could say anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And what is the key to the door? They all have keys."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They do? We just stepped through. Does that mean we are trapped here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Doors won't open without their key. You will have to find another way back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We were coming to see Irishkah at Asylum Flowers. Would you be able to take us there?" I asked before Mary could say anything more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How would one-dims know about the Asylum?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Someone had to tell us about the gate, didn't they?" Mary responded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mustn't have liked you much to forget to tell you about keys. Ah well, I can get you to the Asylum, but don't expect to see the madame."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* previous entry - not sure if it was Grand Bazaar, 12 Factols, or somewhere else */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We stepped out into a dark alcove, beside a noisy passage carved from dark stone and lit with guttering torches. Smoke clogged the air and the stench of sweat and animal dropping fought with the smell of burnt pitch. Noise crashed over us. Voice, raised in multiple languages rang from the stone walls. The bellowing of strange creatures drifted on the faint puffs of air. Beings hurried past our alcove without a second glance. Some looked human, many did not. Mary and I clung to each other in shock, wanting to flee, but captivated by the strange throngs and wanting to go further as well. Mary started to step out until I pulled her back with, "Steve's going to wonder where we are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, right." Mary turned around and pressed her wet hand against the black stone of our alcove. The stone faded to a greyish color as her hand passed through. Within moments we were back in the Hadresson's tank. "That was so incredible! Even with the agony of the crossings. I can't wait to tell Steve all about it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We talked about the diary and what it said about the place we had been. We were debating the finer points of doors between places when we arrived home. Steve must have been watching because he met us at the door. I had been eager to tell him, to get everything resolved, but seeing him, remembering all the good times, stopped me. I told myself after dinner I would talk to him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dinner was good, but when Steve cooked, it always was. After dinner there were stories from the kids about things they'd seen in town. Then Steve related the results of our latest sales. For once we were doing well in terms of crops and the market for them. I would have tried to not say anything about my discoveries if Mary hadn't forced my hand. "It wasn't all quiet around here either. Ara has something to tell us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, uh, that is..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary got up, moved around behind me, and started rubbing on my shoulders. "It'll be ok, lover," she whispered into my ear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I translated that old diary..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, what did it say?" Steve asked as he leaned forward when I hesitated again. I went to the small room we used for paperwork and grabbed the translated pages. I read them aloud to Steve and the children while Mary continued to rub my shoulders.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Steve was looking skeptical hen I finished and the children were mesmerized. "Let's see, momma Ara," Astrid asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok. Let me change clothes first. In our room I slipped out of my clothes and into a tied on sun-suit top. I hoped it wouldn't interfere with my wings when I shifted form. By the time I returned to the living area, I was extremely nervous.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that the amulet?" Astrid asked, pointing at the strip of tape on my side.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes it is," I replied. I pulled the tape loose and dropped the amulet to the floor. The children gasped as I shifted form, then closed in to look closer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can we touch your wings?" Deven asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just be gentle, they're very sensitive." They poked and prodded at my wings, but they were careful about it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My teacher was talking about confession today," Astrid said while still examining my wings. "She wants all of us to go and tell anything about our families."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What kinds of things?" Mary asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything that isn't according to church law. Anything from lustful comments about another person to strange relationships. She singled me out after class to ask about Ara and how she fits with our family."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are you going to do, honey?" Steve asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Confess some little things, like how Deven makes me so angry and how Noah gets too much attention," her face screwed up in anger as she suddenly shouted, "I hate them! I hate the stupid...fucking...church and their god damned priests!" Her face turned white, "I'm sorry! I didn't mean to say those words. It's just I hate the way they act and how they make me feel and all the craziness they tell us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wrapped my wings around her without thinking and murmured, "I know sweety, I know!" Mary wrapped both of us in her arms and repeated the same assurances. Steve held Deven, Noah, and reached for Mary's hand. We stayed wrapped together for a long while before slowly separating. We sat together in a close circle on the floor and held hands, none of us wanting to be very far from our family.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We went through the mirror," Mary said after a long silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You what?" Steve asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ara and I found the mirror of the diary pages and it was a door to another place, just like the diary said."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We could go there! We could leave here and escape the church!" Astrid's voice shook with excitement.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute, Astrid. Remember what the diary said. Sphere isn't a safe place. You'd have to leave your friends, the farm, your cat, and the horses. What would happen to them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you're going to go, aren't you, mama Ara?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes Astrid. I have to find out what I am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's simple. You're one of my moms. What more do you need to know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What I am, whether I'm dangerous to all of you, and what the diary means."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Grandpa Frank and Grandpa Evan could take care of the farm. Just like they did when momma Mary and Steve were sick last year and you couldn't keep up with the farm and your job in town. We could go and come back if things were too bad, right? You and momma Mary made it back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They have their own farms to take care of. It wouldn't be right to ask them to take over ours too," Mary replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The conversation went late into the evening with nothing decided. Astrid wanted to go, even with all the problems. The boys were curious, but not as frustrated as Astrid. Mary, Steve, and I tried to not make any rash decisions in the face of Astrid's wants. It was long past dusk when we put the children to bed and settled into our own large bed. I started to tape the amulet back in place when Mary shook her head, "You are beautiful this way too. Could you leave the amulet off for tonight?" I set the amulet back on the nightstand and rolled back toward them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* insert love-making scene here */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Ara and Mary return to Sphere the next day */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We stepped through the mirror and back into the alcove. The noise pounded over us again as we stepped into the alley. Guttering torches pushed back the shadows cast by the walls and floors of the buildings built around and over the narrow space. To the left it widened out into a sunlit way. People and other things hurried past, carrying bundles, packages, and bit of food. Mary slid closer to me and I wrapped an arm over her shoulder as we walked toward the light.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the end of the alley we stopped and stared. The buildings were made of crazily placed black stone, wood, and plaster. Sharp edges and decorations jutted out at strange angles. Dark grey vine, with glossy purple leaves covered large sections of the walls. The crowd was even more noisy, but what stopped us cold was the view up. Overhead we could see an upside down version of where we were standing. The sky was the inside of a giant sphere. A small, bright sun floated in the center of the space. Clouds and smoke floated over sections of the city, casting darker shadows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You gawkers must be new here," a voice said from my right. I swiveled my gaze down to stare at the dirty urchin standing next to me. She, at least I think it was a girl, under all the grime, gave us a thin smile. "I can give you the what of the place for a small donation."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Exactly, the what of Sphere. Just a few small coppers, not much considering," she replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary shrugged lightly under my arm. "I need to find Asylum Flowers, my coin is stashed there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Taking your pet to the Asylum? She seems content to be a tanar'ri toy. Where'd you find her?" She cocked her head at my puzzled look. "You both one-dims?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, what? One-dim?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"From a single world, not planar travelers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, one-dims then."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't say I never give nuthin to the community. I'll take you to the Asylum, whether you can pay or not." She gestured around us as we walked, "This is the grand bazaar, you can find anything in the multi-verse, for the right price. You are in Sphere, the center of everything. She Who Must Never Be named rules this city from the shadows, decreeing it a place of commerce and a place safe from the gods. Yet the gods seek to influence us through the use of proxies and priests."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">No one looked twice at us as our guide skillfully wove us through the crowds of the bazaar. "There are five sections or wards in the city. We are in the Market Ward, as is the Asylum. The other four wards are the Mistress Ward, where the nobility lives, the Lower Ward, where the poor live, the Clerk's Ward, where the bureaucracy works, and the Hive Ward, where the lowest of the low are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* older ? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Steve was in his center place with Mary and I curled up against him. I was starting to relax after the night when Steve said, "The banker stopped me in the street today. He wants to talk about title to this place, and about your legal standing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought I had that bastard sorted out!" I snarled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I did too. He says your title is suspect because of the disappearance of your mom."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll talk to him in the morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary looked over at me and raised an eyebrow, our usual signal to start sex games with Steve. I closed both eyes briefly, the signal for not tonight. The talk of the banker had killed any residual mood I might have had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The banker was a pedophile. I had discovered it when my father and I were at the bank for a loan my father was working on. The banker's eyes had looked up and down my fourteen year old body, lingering at all the wrong places. It should have been icky and creepy, but it woke something predatory inside me. It was one of the times I knew I wasn't like other children. Have you ever walked into a place and known exactly what is going on and how to handle it? That's the feeling I have gotten at various times in my life. A feeling of being older and more aware than my age should be.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I went back to the bank the next day after school. /* seduces banker - sees him from 14 to 18, when she is too old */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need to set up blackmail methodology that she uses */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she will kill him before leaving for Centrys and leave evidence of his pedophilia, evidence that cannot be ignored */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary and Steve drifted quickly to sleep. I stared at the ceiling for a long while before slipping out of bed and going to the small room we used for the paperwork that couldn't be avoided. I stared at the diary translations, they explained so little and there were so many more questions. My head slumped forward as I drifted toward sleep. An image flashed of a small nitch in the wall of the computer room in the secure sections below the house. They had been created by my parents for use in the smuggling operations they engaged in. We kept up the tradition after my mother left with her smuggler lover after my dad died.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the cellar, behind a shelf holding some of our canned produce, was the hidden door and the loose bricks that formed the combination lock. The door swung in once the correct fifteen brick sequence was complete. Beyond it was a rock passage to a hidden series of rooms. One large one, located under tha barn, held the latest crates of smuggled items. Next to it was the smaller computer room where the system for the locks, communication with the smugglers, and other high tech equipment resided. Near the second passage, leading out from this room to a hidden exit located just past our property line, was a small nitch in the wall. It was about the shape of the amulet from my neck.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The nitch popped open once I placed the amulet against it. Inside was a small book, a credit chit, a plain silver ring, and empirial ID. I pulled out all the items and set them on the single table. The book started out with, "My dearest Arascheya, If you are reading this it means you have discovered the secret of yourself. I am very sorry it had to be this way. I wanted to tell you, I was going to tell you but then the Hadressons were burned by the church. I couldn't risk you that way. I have written down what I can about myself and what you are because of it. It won't answer all your questions, but, maybe, it will help you start to understand. I know you will be angry with me for not telling you. I hope the anger will pass and that we can connect again once it has."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The book contained descriptions of what a succubus was, how being one effected my mother, and what it meant for me. She had been raised by her mother as the successor to a holding in the Abyss. If her sister hadn't overthrown her and driven her and my father from their home, I would have inherited the holding. Instead, they fled, crossing through a place called Centrys with the Hadressons. It mostly made little sense except for the descriptions of the amulet and what would happen once I removed it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The amulet had been designed to suppress all of the abilities I had gotten from my mother. She wasn't sure what they would be, but hadn't wanted anything to give me away to the church. The ring was designed to nullify the succubus ability to drain energy from sexual partners. My mother had one as well, it was what had allowed her to remain with my father. She wasn't sure that aspect of her abilities would carry over to me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had felt energized during sex with Mary in the barn. She had seemed much more tired than I had afterwards. I slipped the silver ring on my finger, just in case.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/*Alternate*/</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I settled the amulet back against my skin and prepared to tape it in place. "Leave it off. You are beautiful this way, too," Mary said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary and Steve drifted quickly into sleep. I stared up at the ceiling, longing for sleep to come. The diary explained so little, now that I accepted it held truth. Strange thoughts drifted in and out of mine. Thoughts of the banker and how I would have to confront him mixed with thoughts of killing him slowly, savoring waves of terror rolling off him as I held him between life and death. Sweat popped out as I fought with myself. I managed to slip from the bed only moments before the shakes hit. Thoughts of the torment were sweet, conflicting with a lifetime of empathy. The amulet pushed the thoughts of evil from me in a cool wash and left me huddled on the floor, still shaking, but from reaction instead of conflict. Sleep came quickly with the amulet taped back against me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Astrid was quiet and sullen at the morning table. Mary was thoughtful and Steve would stare into the distance for long moments between bites of food. Only the two boys were their normal, loud selves. "I still hate this place," was all Astrid said before heading out to catch the bus to school.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll talk to the banker today," I told Steve before he headed out to the barn.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wonder if we can move the gate," Mary asked after he had left. "If we could, we could keep it under our place. It would be safer behind our locks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Astrid knows the combinations," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But she doesn't have the one to the special items vault. I'm worried about Steve. He was ready to kill the banker yesterday. What's wrong?" she asked when she saw me flinch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He wasn't the only one thinking that. But he has hidden his papers away too well to risk harming him. Do you think Steve's still of that mind?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slipped through the woods to the back of the cabin. Very few knew this was where they were taken by the banker when they became his special toys. It had only been luck that had allowed me to figure it out. When the car drove away with his latest victim, I slipped inside and crept to the front room, where I knew he'd be.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You were right to try and kill me. I am an abomination in the eyes of the church," I said from behind him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He stood, whirled to face me, and demanded, "How did you get in here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I let the amulet drop from my hand and watched his face turn white as I changed. "I had thought to blackmail you some more, but I have decided to just kill you instead." For a few long moments I stood and savored the thick, sweet, meaty goodness of his terror, refreshing as cool water on a hot day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You..you wouldn't dare. It'd ruin you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Someone would have to know where your files are for that to work. Ah, the sniveling one at the bank! I never would have guessed. Well played between the two of you." The answer had blossomed in my awareness as he thought it. "He'd have to know where the files...in the basement, in a floor safe. I hope you chose a better combination than your anniversary. Ah, you did!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How...how are you doing that?" he whispered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am a demon. I'm reading it from your mind as you think it." A small moan of bliss slipped from my throat as the intensity of his terror climbed. "Mmmm, keep being afraid! It's almost as good as sex!" I smiled at him. "I was going to discredit you after your death, but your daughter doesn't deserve that. And she doesn't need to know how you've lusted after her all these years. Good, you didn't tell your wife about this. I was wondering if she was a dupe or an accomplice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He jumped across the couch back, catching me almost by surprise. Fear made him stronger than I had expected as he drove me back and down. His flailing made it hard to land blows, until he slipped and I was able to grab his left arm. I flipped over him, grabbed his head, pulled and twisted until I felt his neck snap.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Delicious fear brought my head up to see his driver standing in the now open front door. He turned to flee back to the car. A leap and half-glide brought me to him just as he reached it. His head banged off the car door, dropping him like a rock. I had thought to make the driver the one to find the burned house and corpse inside. Now I would need another.</p>

<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">I had found the diary after I had talked my mother into leaving. We had gone to meet the smuggler ship on its once each year arrival. Our world was poor enough and barren enough that there was little to entice even the illicit trade to it. Yet, this one ship, the Durka, came every year. Sometimes twice in the same year. My mother was the local contact with the ship, but this time she had wanted to introduce me as a backup. The death of my father a season before had hit her very hard, and reminded her of her own mortality.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rather than greet each other in a formal way, my mother and the captain pulled each other into a tight embrace. When they released each other I was introduced to her. "Arascheya, this is Captain Natasha Zelbin of the Durka. Tash, this is my daughter, Arascheya. I'd like you to consider her as a second contact on this world. The death of Andreas was a reminder of how short life can be." The captain pulled my mother close to her again and held her for a long time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At first I thought it was friendship, but then I looked more closely and saw what was underneath. It prompted me to say, "You should go with her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?" they both asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Seriously, you should. We're losing the farm and you two are very close. There's nothing to hold you here, other than me, and I can come see you when the Durka returns."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very forward, aren't you?" Natasha asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's her only flaw. I've tried to get her to tone it down," my mother replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And I do, when I'm around the religious nutters of this world. Mom, don't let this pass you by. Dad's gone, the farm is gone, and I'll be fine. Go, live your life for yourself for a change."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's right. You should come with us. And you should too," the captain said to me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I need to stay here for now," I replied, warmed by the relief in my mother's face. "I might ask for passage in the future, but right now I want to keep you coming here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't leave you here by yourself. What will you do? Where will you live?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mary and Steve keep inviting me to come live with them. Or I could get a small apartment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mary and Steve? Do you know what will happen if the church catches on to the three of you? And what about their children? How can you keep anything secret with kids?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The library pays enough to get a small apartment. I can live there and not endanger Mary and Steve. I'll be fine, mom. You should go and do something for yourself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Think about it Ishala. I'll be here for the next few days while we get the final cargo together. Either way, I'd like to see you tonight." My mother blushed and nodded. I pretended to look elsewhere while they kissed goodbye.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Most of the walk was spent in silence. "Your father knew about us. We could have been like you and your friends if Tash had lived here. But the church was more vigilant in those days. I know you remember what happened at the Hadresson place, but we never told you all of it." She turned toward the barn instead of the house. "I need to explain and to give you something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside the barn, she turned to the tack room, pulled an older, almost worn out bridle from the wall and twisted the hanging peg in a complex series of motions. There was a click from the far corner. Under the small section of floor, a thin scattering of earth, and a sheet of burlap was a keypad lock. It opened to a ladder going down. "This is where we keep the stuff before we ship it out. Now that the farm is going away, I'm not sure what to do." Metal shelves lined the walls of the small room. All were empty except for a small wooden box in the farthest corner. "This is Anna Hadresson's diary," mom said as she handed me the worn cloth wrapped book. "I've never been able to read it. She had a code and never told me where the key was. The bottles contain more of the precious anti-ferts we've been taking. Rotate the newest into it and take these. That way you always have some in case Tash is delayed. This room has a couple of additional entrances," she pulled on the farthest shelf and it swung away with a section of wall. There was a second, smaller room with a table, chair, elaborate computer system, and a door across from where we entered. "The computer has the communications codes to contact the Durka. It also allows for resetting the access codes for the barn, the keypads at each other door, and a monitoring system for the tunnels and this room. After the Hadresson fire, your father and I built this up over years so we could escape if they ever came for us. As long as you lock out the house and barn entrances, you can continue to use these spaces."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mom demonstrated how to use the systems, rehearsed me in the passwords needed to log into the computer, change the locks, and call the Durka. We walked the tunnels to the various entrances. One was in the well, another at the edge of the property, and a final one near the Hadresson place. "Are you going with her?" I asked as we emerged into the cellar under our house.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In the face of my fears about you, yes, I am. You are right, but you should come too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's something I need to do here, although, I'm not sure exactly what. Until I figure it out, I can't leave."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm here for three days this trip. That last contact of yours can't get their part here until then. Go home, think about it. We have tomorrow and the next day if you decide to stay here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">My mother had handed me the diary when we were going through her things. The farm was about to be foreclosed on. After the death of my father, we hadn't been able to sustain it. No men would willingly work under a female and I was getting too old to trade sexual favors with the banker. It had worked great when I was fifteen, fine when I was sixteen, sort of worked when I was eighteen, but twenty was apparently too old.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had asked her how she got the forbidden medicine that kept me from getting pregnant. Rather than reply directly she had agreed to take me to the source and introduce me. I had thought she had meant in town, but she had meant the smugglers instead. They came to our world maybe twice each year. We had little to offer them and scarcely made it worth the trip for what we could afford. While we waited for their ship to touch down, my mother explained there was only one captain willing to make the run on a routine basis. The ship that touched down in front of us was that one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rather than greet each other in a formal way, my mother and the captain pulled each other into a tight embrace. When they released each other I was introduced to her. "Arascheya, this is Captain Natasha Zelbin of the Durka. Tash, this is my daughter, Arascheya. I'd like you to bring enough of the fertility blocker for us each time we come. One of us will be here to collect it and pay you." After the current order had been transferred, they stood and talked for quite a while.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should go with her," I said to my mother as she started to turn away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?" they both asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Seriously, you should. We're losing the farm and you two are very close. There's nothing to hold you here, other than me, and I can come see you when the Durka returns."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very forward, aren't you?" Natasha asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's her only flaw. I've tried to get her to tone it down," my mother replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And I do, when I'm around the religious nutters of this world. Mom, don't let this pass you by. Dad's gone, the farm is gone, and I'll be fine. Go, live your life for yourself for a change."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you think I'd just take her? This ship doesn't run for free."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you keep bringing it here. You can't be making much. What commissions do you have this trip, enough to cover the costs of your ship and crew?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had found the diary in a trunk of my mother's things. There was no way I could keep the farm after her death. No man would work for a woman and I didn't have enough money to pay them if they had. I had been going through the last of her things, sorting them into what I would keep, what I would sell, give away, or take to the dump.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside the front cover was a short note, "Alana, Please keep this safe for me. I think the church is coming for us. Don't worry, we won't reveal you or Morris to them. Love, Anna." The rest of the diary was written in elaborate symbols. If I were one the central worlds I might have been able to get enough computer time to try and crack the code, but here, in the fringes, on a world that shunned technology, there was nothing. After much thought I had set it aside in the pile to keep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she finds out she's not normal from Anna's diary, once she finds the key */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she removes the charm after she is almost raped */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she finds the diary key after she is attacked or before? might make more sense to go looking after, remembering the Hadressons were outcast for some reason */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stood in front of the ornate mirror, staring at my reflection and wondering what to do. I had unraveled Anna Hadresson's diary and found the gate. Now that I could step through, I wasn't sure I wanted to. They had hidden it in a fake tank half way down their well, hoping the church wouldn't find it. The church had found out and burned the farmstead and everyone in it fifteen years ago. The local kids used it as a hazing ground for those of us that didn't fit with the popular crowd.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was that hazing that had brought me to this point. I had been locked into the old well for the night and had gone exploring rather than huddling behind the door like so many others. I had found a loose stone piece under the second stage pump at the two hundred fifty meter depth. Wells near the Hadresson farm and on my parents farm had to be dug with two pumps because water was about five hundred meters down and a single pump wasn't enough to draw it up. My family would be paying off the cost of our well for another three or four generations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Under the loose stone was a tattered diary, written in some kind of strange code. It had taken me years to figure out where Anna had hidden the key for the code. I would puzzle over the script, then sneak out to the farm and look everywhere I could think of. It was like that small bit of meat stuck between your teeth, you just have to worry at it until you get it loose. The key had been dangled down the second section of pipe at the end of a wire mixed in with the rest of the pump workings. If I hadn't been familiar with the pump on my family's farm, I wouldn't have ever found it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The key revealed insane things. My first reading almost convinced me to toss the book as a sick fantasy, but the church didn't burn property and people over fantasy. It spoke of two families, fleeing their holdings in a strange land and coming through a mirror to this place. Here they settled on two farms to raise their infants.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The church dominated everything and they weren't kind to those of us that asked questions. I have lost track of the number of times I had strange punishments for asking the wrong question in class or of a friend. It was the biggest reason I stood in front of the gate in my brother's clothes and with a small pack of things I didn't think I could live without.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With a final deep breath I touched the mirror with the small brass ring that would open it and waited as the mirror shimmered and melted, changing to a rippling wavy surface. Thick, chill silver tendrils clung briefly to me as I stepped into the mirror.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stepped out into a dimly lit shop. Flickering lamps barely illuminated the thick tapestries hanging on the walls. Several mirrors rested in floor stands next to the one I had emerged from. The ceiling was soot blackened wood, darker where the poorly trimmed wicks of the lamps guttered smoke.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Eh ewe, mmm?" a frog-faced, squat thing asked me from behind a short counter. Startled, I stepped back. The ring must have hit the mirror because I fell flat on my back in the fake tank in the Hadresson's well. Anna's diary had spoken of strange things through the gate, but it hadn't prepared me for the reality of it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I could leave, walk up the stairs and back into the world. Back to the drudgery, the religion in everything, the stares and put downs for being one who had questioned. The gate would always be here, my secret way of escape if it ever got bad enough.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My feet were on the stairs when I stopped. Who was I kidding? I'd never try again, not if I left. Once again I stepped through the mirror and tried not to react when the creature once more asked, "Eh ewe, mmm?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I..I don't know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It nodded with what might have been a smile on its face, "ae, ah oon, ih eh." It disappeared through a curtain behind it and was gone for several minutes. A tall woman followed it when it came back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hello. I'm Irishkah. May I help you?" Her words were formal and stilted, like she didn't speak my language often. At first I had thought she was like me until she moved further into the dim light and I saw the small horns on her head, the reddish irises of her eyes, and the complicated amber tattoos running along her cheek bones. Her grey hair stood up from her head in a spiky tangle, odd but exotic as well. She was disturbing and fascinating at the same time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um, I'm, I don't know where to start..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How about your name?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kan...Iskandera," I answered, making it up on the spot, not wanting to be Kanda any more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Iskandera," it rolled off her tongue, sounding almost exotic. "You have stepped into the Sphere, or Centrys, to be more correct. Should I assume you know little of where you are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I nodded, suddenly suspicious. "What do you want from me for your help?" She looked a bit devilish and everyone knew devils always wanted payment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She threw back her head and laughed. "I am a traveler, like yourself. What I want is to learn about other places. What do you think I am?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I blushed deep red at that and tried to answer, "I...uh you...ummm...I don't know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you thought you did, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In...in my world you'd be a...a devil..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, some of my kind aren't very nice. I'm sure some of your kind aren't either. I am a tiefling, for what it's worth. I am sort of nice and embarrassed by some of my kind. What do you call your kind?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, human, I guess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That seems to be a common term among those that look like you. What brought you here? Not many of your kind come and stay."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I despise my world. I found a diary of another who had come here and I was curious. Maybe here would be better than there and if I died, maybe it would still be better than there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She cocked her head at that. "Don't be so eager to meet death. Some of her forms are nasty. Are you going to stay or go back through your gate?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stay," I said hesitantly, then more strongly, "Stay! But I don't know what to do here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She laughed again. "Same as anywhere else. Scrounge money, find a place to stay, and get food."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe I should just go back then," panic and uncertainty boiled up in my mind. I hadn't thought about what would be beyond the gate, just finding the gate had been enough. Anna hadn't said much about what she did beyond the gate, just some of what she had seen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And miss the grand adventures you could have? You are in Sphere, the center of the multi-verse. From here there are gates to countless places, some hostile, some wondrous, all full of strange new experiences. Would "back" offer you that?" She looked a bit embarrassed herself as she continued, "Besides, I could use some help and you'd be perfect."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was so absurd I had to laugh at that. "You are joking, right? I barely had enough skills to live where I came from. What could I possibly offer you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're a one-dim, a person from a world not familiar with the multi-verse." Her look turned vaguely calculating. "I need someone that will be under-estimated to enter a certain place and look around. They'll notice you, but not think anything of it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Suspicion returned in force. "So you do want something. And how dangerous will this be?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ummm..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know what, thanks but no thanks. I don't think I want your help that badly." I turned toward the mirror.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait! Just hear me out, let me explain." I turned back to her, fixing her with a neutral stare. "Ok, look, there's a lot to understand about this place and it would take a very long time to explain it. I'm going to give you a really quick look at the what of Centrys. There are many factions, each with their own leaders and objectives. They fight and squabble, but only to a certain level. Anything that threatens Centrys will immediately be squashed by She Who Must Never Be Named, the true power of the city. No one sees her, or if they do, they don't live to tell the tale. Gods of any form are not allowed in the Sphere. As a result they send in proxies to try and influence events in the city. All of them want access because Centrys truly stands at the center of the multi-verse. The one who controls the city controls access to anywhere. So far none who have opposed She.. have survived, yet they still try from time to time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"One faction captured a friend of mine and is holding her hostage to encourage me to steal an item from another faction. Sounds simple enough on the surface, but I learned what they wanted and what they planned and it convinced me the job was a bad thing. I want help freeing my friend, but I can't get close to the faction areas without being recognized."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I still don't understand how I could help. If I start asking questions, won't they just expel or kill me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had thought to place you in the tavern closest to their headquarters as a server and hope they'd let something slip. Servers are almost invisible and one-dims even more so. One-dims don't know the what of Centrys, so aren't involved. The danger would only come if they suspected you were working for someone as a spy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had been with too many lovers to not hear the lies in her words and enough lovers to know the type of them. "You seem nice enough, yet you insist on lying to me. If you want my help, that is fine, but I won't help if you lie about it." It was a back-handed complement in a way, I hoped she was smart enough to take it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her eyes narrowed as she asked, "Why do you think that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am not a good person by my world's view. I lay with people for money, for influence, and because I like it. A good person would only do so for children, or to please the male of their house. I have been with enough people to know when they are evading or lying to me. It only matters when it effects me, and this will effect me. I may refuse you if I don't like the goals, but you won't shock me if it is against local laws."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She looked me over with an appraising look. Starting with my tall and lean frame, the plain oval face with green eyes and lines at the corners. The hard set of my mouth, eyes, and face, the tangled mop of shortish blonde hair and my hands resting, slightly flexed, below the long sleeves of my shirt. I smiled coldly and shrugged to pull the right sleeve up enough that she could see the knife ready to drop into my hand. "I don't intimidate that easily, one-dim."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No intimidation. Just stop messing with me. If you want help, level with me, otherwise, leave me alone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You aren't tough enough for here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe not, but I wouldn't go down alone," I said through a predatory smile. The one that had backed down many an over-eager man on my world. "I would like friends here, but there has to be trust, which means truth."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She looked a long time before saying, "Little of it is true. There is no partner held captive, but there is an item I want to steal from one of the faction houses. It isn't very major, just worth enough to keep me in food and housing for another month or two, until I can line up another commission. The need for a watcher is in the brothel near the faction house, not in a bar. I didn't want to tell you that up front in case you would be unwilling to enter such a place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I'll help you." I gave her a more genuine smile and said, "Was that so hard?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anger snapped for a moment in her eyes, then dimmed as she laughed, "One-dim kitten thinks she has claws. I hope you are as good as you think you are. Mmmglgglu, I'm going to need that back room a bit longer." The frog-creature nodded slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I followed her slowly into the back room. Boxes were stacked everywhere, shelves were bolted to the walls, and a small table with several chairs huddled near the door on the far side of the room. Now that we weren't fighting I had a chance to look at her. Her body screamed sex. She was taller than me by a couple of inches. Her shoulders were wide and strong, her waist narrow but muscular, and her ass and legs were to die for. She moved with an unconscious grace that had me hot, wet, and almost drooling. When she turned to sit I felt her eyes on me. It was almost impossible to not strip out of my clothes and parade in front of her. Instead, I settled into the other chair, blushing hotly at my thoughts, and hoping she wouldn't notice. She smiled as she licked her lips, shifting in her chair so I could get a good look at her cleavage in the tight, short leather vest she wore. "We need to plan how to get you close to the faction headquarters."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, we should. I need to know more about how things work here, too." I was silently cursing myself for going with modest clothing for a change. I slid a hand down, undid the fly on my thick pants, and fanned them to try and cool myself. Her nostrils flared as she caught my scent and it was my turn to smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So kitten, have you killed in your safe little world?" her voice was less controlled and more husky.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," I replied, thinking of the first one. He had tried to jump me in a back alley and have his way. The keys in my hand had been enough to tear out his throat, but the blood had gone everywhere. And he hadn't stopped as fast as they showed in the entertainments. He had managed to break my jaw on his way down. Afterwards, the police were still going to charge me. All the witnesses were women and everyone knew I was asking for it by dressing slightly provocatively and being in that part of town. One of his brothers had come forward at my trial and testified that my assailant had done this many times. It was just enough to change the verdict to justifiable homicide.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really? More than once?" Her eyebrows had raised in surprise and she had leaned farther forward.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I made a show of staring at her cleavage, stretching back, and letting my hands pull my shirt tight over my curves. How I could be so turned on talking about killing didn't make any sense. "Six, no seven, times." I had almost forgotten the time I had to take two at once.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What were they?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean, what were they?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Demons, devils, something else?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, they were just like me, only monsters," I leaned back to the table as I explained and my hand brushed her arm. An electric shock blasted through me and I grabbed her head, planting a fierce kiss on her surprised lips. She grabbed my arms and we struggled free of the chairs. I grabbed her ass, shoved my right thigh between hers, and wrapped my legs around her thigh. One of her arms wrapped around my back while her other hand twined through my hair and held my mouth on hers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We rode each other until I pulled my mouth away to scream in passion. She followed me a few seconds later. We collapsed into a tangle on the floor, panting and sweating, but still kissing, although more tenderly now.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you have a room?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why are we still here?" I would see the streets of Centrys later, but this time all I saw was her next to me, her hand warm in mine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She started to pull at the laces of her vest as soon as we were inside. I held her hands and said, "Let me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* insert scene here - first Iska, then Iri */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Iri will ask about the monsters statement and be surprised that Iska has killed 7 of her own kind */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did you mean the monsters looked just like you?" she asked when our breathing had returned to normal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The monsters were my kind, but with the belief they had the right to do what they wished to others," I lifted my head slightly from her shoulder so I could look into her red eyes as I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her arm tightened around me, holding me closer to her as she said, "You killed seven of your own kind?" Her eyes showed surprise and respect. I snuggled back down against her and nodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Men in my society could do anything they wanted to a woman. The first time I killed was in self-defense and I was almost executed for it. Women were seen as trophies and children as property. A man could do just about anything to his wife or children as long as he was discrete. If my attacker hadn't been reported by his brother for killing and mutilating several women, I would have been killed because I dared to not want forced sex."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I went back to my jobs at the library and the coffee shop. The library immediately moved me to the reference section, wanting to minimize my contact with the patrons. The coffee shop was more progressive, but I ended up in the back anyway when none of the male customers would talk to me. I tried to get on with my life until I overhead a couple of young boys talking about their club leader. The acts he performed on those boys and forced them to do with each other enraged me so I used my time in the back for research. I went to a local unarmed combat class in the few hours I had left. It was useless until I started watching what the boys were learning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ten months later I struck. It was awful, all the blood and cleanup, but no one figured out where that sick piece of filth went. After that, it was easier with each new target. The arrogance of being a male in that culture made it simpler than it would have been if I had been anywhere else, but anywhere else I wouldn't have ended up this way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know what to say," her eyes were sad as she spoke. "To think you had to go through that. I've rarely killed, and never my own kind. It changed me in ways I'm not sure about."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It felt like a slap, but I didn't think it was meant that way. "It changed me too. I can't escape seeing a possible target when I meet someone, and it takes me a much longer time to warm up to men. I hate killing and I don't, I know that makes no sense, but I don't mind doing it, not if it saves someone less able from abuse."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She pulled me close and stroked my hair softly. "Why did you warm up to me so fast?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Because you're hot? Seriously, I don't know, except I feel I know someone like you from what led me to the gate."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anna Hadresson, right? I knew her and I miss her. She was a lot like you, just more idealistic. She tried to change her world through normal methods. Her brother lived just long enough to tell me about it when their place was burned."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Were you two.."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Involved? No. She was strictly a lover of men. I miss her and wish she hadn't come from a place that would discard her so easily. Are you going back there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could, but I think my luck is running thin. My coverups were good, but the police aren't stupid either and they've been talking to the Imperial Security Forces. The Imps don't love our colony, but they are bound to investigate if asked, and they are frighteningly effective."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">It made me so angry that I swore no man would mess with me that way again. Next time someone tried I was more ready and managed to get to a secluded place before killing him. After that it was easier." I had never been proud of those times, but they still confused me. I didn't feel the remorse or devastation that many did after killing another person.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Easier?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I knew how to catch them and dispose of them, and I only targeted abusers and predators, so I didn't feel bad about it. Although the religion of my world says I am going straight to hell for it. But it seems very strange to me. Predators kill prey in every species. If predators get out of hand, something has to thin them. All I am doing is thinning the predators of my species. It is so puzzling." I rolled over and stared up at the stained ceiling of her tiny room. It was rough boards with large dark stains from something leaking in from above. The walls were rough stone with a splash of dirty grey paint. The floor was the same kind of rough wood as the ceiling. Her bed was tiny. I barely had room to roll partway onto my back, and lumpy, nothing more than pads on a stone ledge.</p>
