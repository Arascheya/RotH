<p class="regtxt5">We stood in front of the mirror. Mary reached her hand toward it until I stopped her. I pulled the amulet from my side and pressed it into her hand. "Maybe we'll blend in better with me in this form." She nodded and placed it in her pocket. She took my hand and stepped into the mirror.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The mirror was a cold line across my skin. The blackness beyond a screaming fire-brand of heat, then we were through.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The sound hit first, innumerable voices speaking in many languages. Next came the smell, roasted meat, unwashed bodies, animals, perfumes, stinks, a hint of rot, flowers, spices, old cloth, and then the sights. Fantastical beings walked beside humans and things more horrible than the worst of the church paintings and illustrations, fanciful beings, and animals defying description. We stumbled back and half fell through the mirror, into the tank. "What the fuck?" we said in unison.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's real," Mary finally said. We stared at each other, then laughed and whooped in exaltation. "Want to go back through?" I hesitated, then nodded. Mary grabbed my hand and we stepped back into the whirl of bodies. This time we were a bit more prepared. We were in a narrow passage, roofed with arched brick work. People hurried, shuffled, and sauntered by. Alcoves opened along the passage as store fronts, filled with bundles of cloth, gowns, dresses, and clothing of all sorts. Voices were raised in haggling and others were hushed in low conversations. Bright light streamed down through open windows high in the brick, letting out the smoke from thousands of lamps and letting in light and fresh air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This must be Sphere," Mary said in awe.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A demonic and a humanish, that's a rare sight, even for Sphere," a voice to my right caught our attention,  A dirty urchin in ratty clothes looked up at us. She, or he, it was impossible to tell under the grime and from the lack of age, waited a moment and asked, "Is she your property?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No! We are..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lovers," Mary interjected.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lovers? That's very enlightened for single dims," the child laughed at our puzzled looks and explained, "Single Dims are from a realm, not from Sphere. Newcomers might be another word, though most single dims aren't interested in the what of Sphere, only in escaping back to where they came from. What about you? You typical or open? I can give you the what of the place for a bit of scratch."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um, we, er, what is this scratch?" Mary asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The urchin rolled its eyes and replied, "Money, scratch, coin, value, whatever you trade in the place you are from."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That would be good, Would this be enough?" I said, reaching into a pocket and pulling out a small bit of our money.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you tell me of your realm as we go. I want to learn about as many as I can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What should we call you?" Mary asked. "I don't feel right with 'hey you'."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can call me Alys." She took us around the Great Souk, the marketplace where we had arrived. Hours passed as we wandered the narrow streets, some under high ceilings, some under cloth banners, and some open to the sky. When we stopped, staring up at the sky the first time we saw it, Alys explained about Sphere. Sphere was actually a Sphere, with the city on the inside walls. Looking up would let you see across the sky to the city on the far side. A tiny sun floated at the center of the sphere, lightening and darkening to give day, night, and heat to the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were overloaded by sights and sounds by the time Alys returned us to the street we had emerged on. "We need to go back," Mary stated.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Will you come again? You never told me of your place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"After this, our place is not very interesting," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is if this is all you know," Alys answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, of course we'll come again. How safe is Sphere? There are a few others that would like to see it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Safe? Is there anywhere truly safe? Is your world safe?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It..." Mary stopped, looked at me, and shook her head. "I guess it isn't, not really, unless you are exactly as the church desires. Even then..." she stopped again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Souk is a sanctuary place of sorts. You are safer here than in the rest of Sphere. You could bring the others, just stay together."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What if we want to find you? Have you show us more or tell you about our home?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alys pressed a small rock into my hand. It was smooth, grey-green, and ovoid. "Squeeze this tight and think of me. I'll get the message. All us guides have them. It's said She Who Must Never Be Named gave one to the first guide in Sphere, back when She pulled it together from the beginning of time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's a mouthful," I started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No one knows her name. No one has seen her, but she is the power here. Threaten Sphere and She will deal with you. Either by placing you in a private dimensional maze, with no escape, or by turning you inside out and leaving your corpse as a message to the world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We stepped back through the door and into the tank. Hand in hand we walked up the crumbling stairs and back into the late sunlight of our home. Steve took in our identical grins and motioned us inside. "That good, huh?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Amazing!" Again we spoke in unison.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tell us all about it!" Astrid ran up and hugged us. She dragged us into the dining room and sat us down, throwing questions at us while we stared at the food Steve had prepared. She kept us talking for over an hour before we could slow her down enough to eat. After cleaning up from dinner, Astrid bombarded us with more question until very late in the evening.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Astrid had finally run out of questions, letting us get her and the boys sent off to bed. I had just settled down on Steve, slipping him inside me for a little late night delight, when there was a hesitant knock at the door. "Am I interrupting anything? I need to talk..." Astrid said through the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No," I replied with a soft sigh, rolling off Steve and arranging the covers. "Come in Astrid."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stared at the floor for a long time before speaking, "It's about school..." She stopped and fidgeted before continuing in a rush, "I found out John Tyner's being, being," she turned bright red, "being molested by Mr. Arnsten, the boy's coach. What should I do about it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you find out?" Steve asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was late getting out of the showers after volleyball and heard thumping coming from the equipment room. I was going to walk in until I heard the whimpers and peered around the corner. Mr. Arnsten had John bent over a weight bench and was , well, doing what you three do, but John didn't seem to like it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is there a teacher you can talk to?" Steve asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. Most of them are women and they are ignored by Mr. Flerrence, the principal, and Mr. Flerrence is afraid of Mr. Arnsten. You can see it in the way they talk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How well do you know John," I asked. "Would he trust you to talk to you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We could bring it up with the authorities..." Steve started to suggest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think that would work. The police chief is the brother of Arnsten, the prosecutor is married to an Arnsten sister, and the bank manager is tied into the extended family as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And Thomas Walles, the bank manager, is a pedophile besides," Mary said as she came in from the bathroom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pedophile?" Astrid asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A pedophile is an adult that isn't interested in sex unless it's with a child or young teenager," I answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That seems sick," Astrid said. "I heard Jenny talking to Francine about Mr. Walles. Something about helping her dad get an extension on their loans."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is baby," Mary answered. Mary looked at me as she continued, "Yes, baby, that's what is going on."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I remembered the banker. He caught Mary and I outside the school one day and offered to let us help Mary's father with a loan. We were thirteen at the time. Being farm girls, I had an idea what he was thinking and volunteered to protect Mary. It was a good thing too, he was a total pig. His idea of foreplay was to grab my tits and squeeze hard. The he yanked my clothes off and pounded into me. It was the worst pain I had felt at that point in my life. If Mary and I hadn't been having sex with Steve, it would have ruined sex for me. Mary was horrified when I told her what the creep had wanted. I made her promise not to tell her dad, knowing Walles would retaliate if he said anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something snapped at the thought of Walles stalking Astrid. "Do you know how many boys Arnsten might be molesting?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Astrid shook her head, "Do you want me to ask John?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you can. Then I'll see it gets taken care of."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You will?" Astrid leapt on the bed and gave me a tight hug, hugged Mary and Steve, and left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are you planning, baby?" Mary asked me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure yet, but this has to stop. Astrid's the age we were when he started with me." Mary grimaced and looked away. "No guilt, remember? It was disgusting for what it was, but didn't mark me as much as it could have. I think I know why now," I said, tapping the amulet taped to my side.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* anything else of interest or do they just sleep that night? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Astrid came up, grabbed my hand, and dragged me into her room as I came out of the bathroom, first thing in the morning. "Mommy Ara, I need to ask you something." She stopped, red faced and jittery.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I sat on the bed and said, "What is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't want to worry Momma Mary or upset Steve."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I'm ok to worry?" She looked away, frightened. "I'm teasing you. You can tell me anything, you know that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She gulped and nodded. "Mr. Walles stopped me at the bus yesterday. He says I have to come see him if I don't want him to go to the church about you and Mary and Steve." I tried to keep the rage off my face, but some must have shown through, "He wants to, to have, to have sex with me doesn't he?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I think he does, but none of us want you to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But he will turn you in!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wrapped my arms around her and hugged her tight. "No, he won't. I won't let him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't tell Momma Mary and Steve, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I won't, but let me share a secret. Walles did the same to Mary and I when we were your age. Momma Mary would understand if you ever want to tell her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's horrible! And no one stopped him? Did, did momma..." her voice broke as she clung tighter to me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, sweetie, she didn't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Deven and Noah arrived home at the usual time, but Astrid wasn't with them. "Deven, where's Astrid?" Mary asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She had to go with Mr. Walles. He said you said it was ok." Mary went white, I'm sure I did too.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Deven and Noah looked scared until Mary reassured them. "I need to take care of this," I mumbled as I pulled the amulet loose from my side and dropped it into Mary's hand. Desperation clawed at me while I tried to remember where Walles took his "special" children. I saw the cabin room again, the dirty bed, stained with years of blood and fluids, in the dingy little room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It felt like something punched me in the guts, blackness danced for a moment across my eyes, and then I was in the room. Astrid was on the bed with her hands bound and her dress pushed up. Through the haze of rage I saw her underwear was still on. "Momma Ara, I knew you'd come!" she cried.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I knew your family was demonic," Walles said. "How did you summon this thing? Tell me little girl, or I'll do more than rape you," Walles cried. His terror flooded my senses with warmth.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was going to threaten you, but that won't be enough, will it?" I asked coldly. "Astrid, honey, I'm going to take this...thing...into the next room. I'll be back for you very soon, I promise."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, but don't be too long. My arms are starting to hurt."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I won't, honey." I advanced on Walles. To his credit, he tried to stand against me, even as his terror increased, caressing me in sensuous waves. "You will not have my daughter."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who are you?" he asked in a whisper. I shifted, without the amulet, and found out another facet of my new self. "You! I should have killed you when I was done with you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should have. Seems I'm the abomination the church claimed my mother was." I continued my advance, forcing him to back through the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You..you wouldn't dare kill me. It'd ruin you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Someone would have to know where your files are for that to work. Ah, the sniveling one at the bank! I never would have guessed. Well played between the two of you." The answer had blossomed in my awareness as he thought it. "He'd have to know where the files...in the basement, in a wall safe. I hope you chose a better combination than your anniversary. Ah, you did!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How...how are you doing that?" he whispered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am a demon. I'm reading it from your mind as you think it." A small moan of bliss slipped from my throat as the intensity of his terror climbed. "Mmmm, keep being afraid! It's almost as good as sex!" I smiled at him. "I was going to discredit you after your death, but your daughter doesn't deserve that. And she doesn't need to know how you've lusted after her all these years. Good, you didn't tell your wife about this. I was wondering if she was a dupe or an accomplice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the hallway, he reached for something on a small table. I saw it happening an instant before he moved and ducked out of the way as he swung the knife through the place my neck had been. I leapt at him, forcing him back and to the floor. His terror was warm, sweet, and intoxicating, distracting me enough for him to land a painful blow to my head. It snapped me back and we fought on the floor. His fear gave him strength, but it was no match for my rage. Within minutes I had snapped his neck.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His fear snapped off with the breaking of his neck. The pleasure drained away fast, leaving me looking down at Walles, or rather his body. His body, I had just killed someone. I ran for the tiny bathroom, leaned over the chipped, filthy bowl, and heaved my guts out. The smell of the filth and everything wouldn't let me stop until I was dry heaving and fighting for breath. The shakes and tears hit next. I would have remained there for a long time if a warm trickle of fear hadn't roused me. For a brief moment I savored it until I remembered who it was coming from. Astrid's panicked voice reached me as I was stuffing the desire for fear down. "Momma? Momma! I want to go home!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I ran back to the bedroom and untied her. She looked at my white, blotchy, tear-stained face and asked, "Are you alright, momma?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm ok honey. I have to get the things he was threatening us with and then we can get out of here." I pulled her up, wrapped my wings around her, and started back to the hall.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you kill him?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stopped at her question and started to say, "I..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hope you did! He was mean and creepy. Even his own daughter was scared of him. You know how you, Momma Mary, and Steve sometimes watch me sleep and I feel all safe and loved? He would watch Arlene sleep, but when she woke up, what he was doing and how he was looking would frighten her. She said he was touching himself and leering. She told her mom, but she didn't know what to do either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't look, baby," I said as I stepped out of the room. I felt her head move as she turned to look back and down at the thing on the floor. "I told you..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok. He looks like any of the dead animals before we butcher them, well, except for the clothes. I hope Arlene will be ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know her well?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, well, sort of. I mean, she's afraid all the time. Scared and timid around the other kids and they pick on her without mercy because of her father."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you trust her, or her mom?" I asked as we headed toward the narrow, steep stairs to the root cellar. I had been down there once when I had displeased Walles during one of our encounters. It was a stooped, tiny, dirt floored space under the cabin and it felt even smaller now that I was grown up. In the far wall, behind old wooden shelves, was a medium sized safe. It opened to the combination I had pulled from Walles mind and it was filled with oilskin wrapped bundles stacked on top of a black obsidian box. I scooped up everything and turned to head up the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I do trust her. Her mom seems nice, but she's also really scared all the time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The sound of a door stopped her. Footsteps sounded from near the front of the house as a voice called out, "Tom, you almost done? Is it my turn yet?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Astrid ran to me and wrapped herself tight. Her terror fed my fear and suddenly we were in the master bedroom at our place. "How did you do that?" Astrid asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Momma Ara, I have to tell you something," Astrid said, turning red and clinging to me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry I lied to you. Arlene and I are best friends, like you and Momma Mary. What's going to happen to her now? That man upstairs was Coach Arnsten. He took me to that place. Arlene's even more afraid of him, like, maybe, her father was keeping him from molesting her. And Arlene's mom would shrink in on herself any time he was nearby."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Baby, do you think you could get Arlene and her mom to come home with Mary and Steve? It will be safer for them if they aren't at home for a while. I have to go do some more bad things and I don't want them to be involved." She nodded slowly and hurried out of the room. I heard he start to talk to Mary and burst into tears. A few minutes later the horse cart rattled down the drive.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I popped back into the basement just as Arnsten turned from the open safe. "Looking for something?" I asked through my demonic visage. His fear was thicker, coarser, but fuller than Walles fear had been. It took all my will to focus through it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What the hell are you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Death, come to take you to your reward." All the nightmares from the church teaching boiled in the back of my head, feeding me images of what could await him and I described them to him as his fear built. I savored it, feeding on it lick a thick, juicy steak, warm and bloody. I was two meters from him when he clutched at his chest and groaned. The fear spiked strong enough that I dropped to the floor, moaning in ecstasy while the heart attack slowly killed him. Only when he was dead was I able to rise, dust myself off and examine his body. There was nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't puke this time, but there was nausea and the shakes, especially when I remembered how wonderful the fear had tasted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stood in the basement for a long time, trying to decide what to do. The local police had only basic investigators. If a case required additional expertise an Imperium Investigation Team would have to be called in. If there was one near our system, they could arrive in a day or two. Usually it would take a week or more. One would be called for the town banker and the winning coach of the school. I suspected my trace would be unexpected and hard to identify.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the end I took the bodies and dropped them in the ruins of the Hadresson house. I left the doors and windows of the cabin open and trashed the inside. Then I went home, arriving in the master bedroom. I had thought I'd go and meet the others as they returned, but the shakes hit me hard now that everything had been taken care of.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mary found me on the bed curled into a tight ball and crying softly. Her hand, stroking my hair, slowly brought me back. "Are you going to be ok, lover?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I've just killed two men, and I don't regret it. Shouldn't I feel regret?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. They were vermin, in many ways." She saw something in my face and asked, "Is that all that's bothering you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was tempted to say yes, but shook my head and answered, "My other form tastes fear and likes it. God, Mary, I was almost orgasming on the intensity of their fear, just before they died. That's just wrong and creepy!" The shakes hit again and she held me for a very long time as they rose and fell in intensity. I don't know when Steve and Astrid joined us, but they added their warmth. Slowly it stilled the shivers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Arlene and Mrs. Walles are here. We put them in the guest room for now. Are you going to be ok, Momma Ara?" Astrid spoke softly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...I think so, baby," I answered after a long time. I smiled weakly at her, "See, even grown ups can get scared."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She tapped me lightly, "I already knew that!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are we at risk?" Steve finally asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think so."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you dispose of the bodies, clean up any trace, remove indications of...of my being there?" Astrid asked, choking only a little bit when remembering her place in this.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I did. I tried to remember all those entertainments we've see."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Chief Arnsten will call in an investigative team once he realizes Walles is missing," Astrid said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know. The bodies won't be found at the cabin. Problem is Mrs. Walles will come under suspicion and I'm not sure what to do about that. Although, without bodies, it will be harder to tie her to anything. Do you think she'll be able to handle it?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She might," Steve answered slowly. "Remember when we fought just after graduation? I spent a little time with her. I think she's stronger than she realizes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was Coach Arnsten the second body? I talked to John and he said most of the team had been messed with," Astrid asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He was. There's an accomplice at the bank, the assistant manager, Josh Darreth. He's supposed to release all the files Walles has collected and bring ruin to those he doesn't like if anything happens to Walles. Astrid and I recovered files and items from the Walles' cabin, but I don't know if there are others in the possession of Darreth. Looks like I'm not done being bad." A small shudder followed the words. "Astrid, do you think Mrs. Walles would know where the bank assistant lives? I'd rather not talk to him at the bank."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She might, But I know he stays at the rooming house, in the top rooms," Mary answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Back soon," I told them and blinked out. Dizziness hit when I appeared in the overgrown section of the town park. I staggered into a tree and let it hold me up until the world stopped spinning. When I could walk again, I made my way to the rooming house. The fire escape provided the best route to the third floor. Then it was a simple matter to slip in through the half open window. I was probably the worst crime wave our little town had seen in years, other than the continuous pedophilia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Darreth wasn't in his rooms, so I wandered around, looking at the books on the small shelf, the papers on the table in the dining alcove, and through his ice box. Everything was what one would expect for a bachelor in a small town. When I was finished looking through the small, one bedroom apartment, I settled in to wait.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dusk had long passed when a key turned in the lock and the door opened. Darreth came in with Monica Arnsten, the police chief's wife. I popped out before they saw me, arriving home and dropping to the bed as the room spun. Nausea followed me down to the bed and I rolled onto my back, taking long, slow breaths, trying to fight it off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You ok, baby?" Mary asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ugh, guess I can't do the popping out thing too many times in a row," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was he there?" Steve asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"With Monica Arnsten. I'll have to try later, maybe just before dawn." Sleep sucked me down fast once the nausea started to let up. Vague dreams flitted through my sleep, dark, disturbing, but strangely powerful as well.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">I awoke slightly before dawn. It was dark in Darreth's rooms when I popped in. Monica had left sometime before my arrival. I walked carefully to the bed and grabbed his foot. He woke fast an focused. "What the hell are you?" His voice was nervous, but the expected fear wasn't there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Walles is gone. I'm here to make sure you don't hurt anyone with his papers and crazy schemes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh? How do you plan to do that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you won't turn them over, will you mister imperial special agent?" I had seen glimmers flashing from his mind of enormous cities, starships, and offices. "But what, I wonder, would bring a special agent to the asshole end of the Imperium?" Things flickered in my mind but wouldn't form. This one was much better at masking and concealing his thoughts than the others.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something else flashed in my mind as well. I eased myself down onto the floor and settled into a position of apparent submission. My face shifted to an open and interested look while I focused on oozing warmth and sincerity. It must have worked because he relaxed back on the bed and said, "Why don't you tell me? We can talk, if you'd like."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I asked, "What shall we talk about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm curious, can you read my thoughts?" He smiled slightly when I said nothing. "You aren't the only telepath in the Imperium. We are trained to mask against casual scans. However, you aren't like any of the main races in the Imperium and you aren't like the others here. What's your story? I bet it's as interesting as mine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is this, you show me yours, I show you mine?" I had the satisfaction of a small blush from him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, something like that." We stared at each other for a long time until he spoke, "Guess I'll start. This backwater is a haven for a certain type of religious faction, a sect of fundamentalist reactionaries. The Imperium has had some difficulty with groups like this and sends agents in to keep track of things. The bank was my deep cover and my association with Thomas Walles was a way to stay close. I don't like him. His practices and ways make me sick, but his activities let me see all the skeletons in this area."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was born here, at least I think I was. My family was...was burned...died in a fire when I was five."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're the Hadresson girl? I heard about the fire and, if I'd been here, there would have been deaths," his face had gone hard. "I have to tolerate a lot of the religious shit to do my job, but that would have been too much. How did you survive, looking like you do?"</p>
