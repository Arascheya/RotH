<p class="regtxt5">/* letter in box that opens to the amulet */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My dearest Arascheya,</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If you are reading this the church followed through and burned the farm. I asked the Serazars to take you in. I hope they did and that they have kept you safe and happy. They were the first people we met here, after coming through the portal. Somehow they are more open minded than the rest of the village. Must have something to do with the smuggling and contact with the outside.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Your name is Arascheya ni Iskandera, literally, Arascheya, daughter of Iskandera. My true name is Iskandera and we come from a long line of multi-planars. Your father and I fled when our holdings were invaded by another, larger, group of multis. You have a heritage, a small holding in the Sphere of Concordant Discord, just out from Sphere, the center of everything.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* some brief on what she is? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Always remember, the church is wrong. So called demons and devils have as much free will as everyone else. The multiverse has evil and good, but sentient beings choose what they are. Yes, there is pressure to conform to a certain group think, but that applies everywhere, including in the church teachings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I am writing this part as quickly as I can, hoping to get it sealed into the protector before the church arrives. I know you wonder why we were burned. I don't know why your older sister turned us in. Maybe she was brain washed, maybe she was jealous of having a new sister, or maybe the church promised her something she desperately wanted. If you found the diary before you found this, then you know the rest of it. If you haven't, find the diary. I hid it in the smuggler tunnels under the second Serazar farm, the one promised to Mary and whomever she marries. </p>
