<p class="pagecaption">London: 1887: Home at the Marsters Place</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* this needs to be reworked - the conspiritors should appear to kill each other - Agatha has already poisoned father, she was going to hook up with the other Marsters, poison him, then marry the young Abernathy - the other Marsters thought Agatha would marry him and they woul have Ange marry Abernathy to secure the Abernathy name and fortune */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Mere will need to plant evidence of the conspiracy somewhere where it can be discoverd in the investigations - in the Lestrade photo, she will not confess to killing the Marsters family */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Ange's step-mom qwas conspiring with Ange's fiance to kill her husband, bring in the brother, kill him, kill Ange, and marry the fiance herself. Her intent was to get both the Marsters fortune and the fiance's family estate. Mere learns this when fast-sampling the fiance. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* next section - Ange homecoming - describes her return to Angelique's after discovering the betrayal be family and fiance - finds James already dead, arriving too late to save him - need to figure out how she connects with Wellinghams, although, she would know to contact them after the police once she "discovers" the bodies */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* meeting the Wellinghams, figuring out she will stay in the Marsters home but visit more often, becoming real friends with Lucy and Mina, pulling Dementia into the mix - use the section from Anastasia, but modify to fit the actual alt. earth series of events with Dementia and Angelique */*/</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The cab pulled up in front of the Marsters place, which spoke of more money than many of the neighbors. An ornate wrought iron gate closed the drive to the carriage building tucked behind the main house. A large lawn separated the house from the street and the neighbors. A high stone wall provided privacy. The house was a large pile of intricately placed stone, interesting, but subtle in design, not quite mansion, not quite castle, and not quite square box house. Angelique's key opened the gate and it swung open on well oiled hinges.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The main door was thick oak, polished to a gleaming luster. Gas lamps framed the door, turned up just enough to illuminate the door and walk. Gauze curtains had been pulled across the windows, letting out warm light but softening any movement and shadows from those inside. The key opened the door and I slipped in. "Steve, is that you, dear?" An older woman's voice called from the drawing room to my left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes my love."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, come in here dear." I walked into the drawing room, where Angelique's step-mother waited, seated upon the couch, staring down at a man, twisted on the floor. "Is it done, dear?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, the girl is dead, killed by a thug by the theatre. Stepped up the time line, did you, dearest?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, this meddlesome old fool showed up wanting to talk to me before I had my husband's body in the garden. I had some poisoned tea left and figured we could finish sooner. Will you be a dear and help me get the two of them into the garden and buried?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. I'll get the doors open and we can drag this through the kitchen." In the kitchen I grabbed the sharpest knife I could find and slipped back into the drawing room. The cut was swift and sure, the blood spray more forceful than expected. I made sure some landed on Steve as she slumped forward and fell on top of the dead man. There were clothes in the master bed room that would fit Steve. I grabbed some, ran from the house, and hurried through the garden. There was one set of neighbors that had the unfashionable habit of sitting in their garden in the middle of the night. It was easy to make sure they saw Steve running across the back of their land and stopping next to a trash bin. He changed clothes and hurried away. Once I was out of view, I shifted to mist and drifted back home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I found Angelique's father in the library, with a partial cup of cold tea next to him. Her brother was cold in his bed. The only person missing was the youngest son, offspring of the step-mother and the father. I sat on Angelique's bed, after dressing in something suitable for the theatre, and tried to decide on the best story for the police. Digging through Angelique's fragmented memories I found she idolized Sherlock Holmes, having read every story published by Aurther Conan Doyle. If this had been poor people there would be a token investigation and it wouldn't really matter what I told them, but these were wealthy people and the investigation would be thorough. I walked to the parlor, lifted the handset on the expensive new telephone, and asked for the police. Pretending hysteria was harder than I expected. I hadn't been a helpless victim in thousands of years and had almost forgotten what it felt like.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The police arrived in minutes with a group of constables and Inspector Lestrade. I explained through tears and hysterics that I had been at the Prince of Wales Theatre for a show, where my fiancee had abandoned me near the end of the show, and had made my way home to find everyone where they lay.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lestrade and his officers poked around the house and asked so many questions I quickly lost track of them. They had me accompany them from room to room and say if anything was missing. They asked about friends, relatives, and enemies of my mother and father. I answered as best I could, hoping I was confused and clear enough to not give myself away. Once he had seen the house, he led me to the dining room, out of sight of the bodies, and settled me in a chair, asking more questions in as gentle a manner as possible.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After several questions, a young, burly constable came in and coughed discretely. "Inspector, Doctor Petrie is here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you Lamb. Have him find me after he has examined the deceased. I'm sorry, where were we?" He asked a few more questions, then said, "May I leave you with one of the constables while I take a look for myself?" I noddd and he sent the young constable back in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hadn't figured on the boredom of an investigation. Several hours had passed and Inspector Lestrade was still checking through the house and asking even more questions. It was quite late when he asked, "Do you have someone you can call? I don't think you should be alone here tonight. I will have one of my men take you where you need to go and leave me the address in case I have more things to check up on." I gave him the Wellingham's address and telephone number, then called them. I was told to come right over. "Inspector, would you send someone to the Trunchwells in Croydon, Surrey. My step-brother Edward is staying with his grandparents and I have no idea if he is in danger as well. He shouldn't hear of this through the news either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will have that done. Lamb, would you see to it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes Inspector."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Whe you say the Wellinghams, do you mean the Wellinghams of International Transportation Consortium?" Lestrade asked. I nodded and he looked at me closely. "I'll be glad to escort you to there." He reached out and took my arm. I mostly managed to hide the stumble his touch caused. Images flickered and shot across my vision but wouldn't resolve into anything useful.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had hoped to use the carriage ride to dig out what Angelique knew of the Wellinghams so I wouldn't look the total fool when we arrived. Lestrade had other ideas and turned to me as soon as the carriage started to move, "I would like to know what is actually going on, Miss Marsters."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't understand, Inspector."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your hysteria comes and goes, depending on who you think is watching you. You flinched when I touched you, but not like a victim, more like someone disoriented briefly. You watched everything we did more closely than a young woman of your station normally would. You were curious about what we were doing, and you weren't in shock from the deaths. The bodies didn't seem to trouble you very much either. Just now, when escorting you, I find you are in far better shape than a rich young woman would be. Your descriptions were very analytical and precise, again, not something I would expect from a young socialite."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The visions snapped into clarity. One misstep and Lestrade would focus his investigation on me and things would go very badly. There was one route through the evening that would keep things unfolding in the best direction and it required that I dance very close to the truth with the inspector. My face must have shifted a bit because he smiled as I spoke, "You are right. Things in my life have not been normal for quite some time." As I spoke, I could feel the painted on soft simpleness I had tried to project fade and leave the harder edged me exposed. "My mother, my actual mother, was the sister of Lord Willem Wellingham. When I was younger, I was raised around Lord Willem's family. He encouraged his daughter, her friend, and I to explore ideas and possibilities that weren't considered proper. My father tried to undo all of Lord Willem's teachings after my mother died. His new wife, Victoria Trunchwell, was even more adamant about my assuming my proper place in decent society. As to the observation, I am a follower of the Holmes stories and pride myself on an ability to observe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So you would have motive. I had wondered," Lestrade said, watching me closely. I couldn't hide the slight flicker of a predatory smile and I didn't miss his either.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I would, but I wouldn't have killed my brother, John."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We rode on for a time in silence before curiosity got the better of me. "May I ask you somethng?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm a serious follower of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but I don't understand why there's an inspector with your name in the stories."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a bit of a joke between myself and the author."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know Aurther Conan Doyle? Could you introduce us? I'd love to meet him!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know him, after a fashion. He's very private. I don't think he'd appreciate me bringing you to him. I'm sorry."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can you tell me about him and where he gets his ieas for the cases?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He is a medical man and he has some contact with the police. I think he takes ideas from our cases and changes enough to make them interesting and unique."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He doesn't treat you very well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His laugh was warm and genuine as he asnswered, "I don't want him to. It's a kind of joke we share, and it keeps me humble." We spent the rest of the trip talking about our favorite stories.</p>
