<p class="pagecaption">Sea Voyage</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I had been on the royal barges and various boats on the Nile but nothing prepared me for the smoking behemoth that greeted me at the docks when I began my journey to London. We were herded in and expertly shuffled into our rooms. I had taken mid-cost passage. Expensive enough to be comfortable but not so much as to draw unwanted attention.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Mediterranean was wonderful. The sun was warm and the ship slid gracefully through the small waves around it. We stopped at several ports however I remained on the ship. I was confused enough just trying to sort out all the data I was getting from sampling other passengers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When we reached the Atlantic the weather changed from the warm sunlight I had known all my life into a wild raging thing. Water fell in sheets from the sky. Cold winds buffeted the ship. As we moved toward the north the temperature dropped and a damp chill always seemed to invade my being. I mostly stayed in my cabin, only venturing out to take a random sample once in a while. I kept the coal fire in my stove running as hot as I could to try and stay warm. It didn't help very much.</p>
