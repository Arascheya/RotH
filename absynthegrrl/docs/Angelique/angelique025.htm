<p class="pagecaption">London: 1887: Uncle Willem</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The morning after my visit to Uncle Richard, Uncle Willem stopped me as I got up from breakfast. "Angelique, may I see you a moment?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lucy and Mina looked at each other, then continued out to their day. I followed him to his study, where he motioned for me to sit. He sat in a chair across and looked at me for a moment. "I don't know how to begin. You are an extrordinary young woman. Last time I saw you, you were, well, the best example of the aweful things we do to women."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I didn't know what to say, so I remained quiet, waiting for him to start again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now, you out-shine Lucy and Mina in independence. It's like you aren't even the same person. We both know that's not possible, don't we. Your memories match mine of your early childhood. How did you do it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The overlay didn't glitch, like it had with Lestrade, but I didn't know what to do. No vision guided me this time. I had barely realized I had risen until Uncle Willem spoke from beside me, "Beautiful view, isn't it? I find staring into the distance can clear the mind."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could we leave it at trauma? The truth is unbelievable."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Try the truth, please," he replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I told him, with far less detail than I gave Lestrade, expecting surprise or disbelief. Instead, he listened, nodded at some of it, and said when I was done, "Vampyr? Not from Sphere, then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Two years ago we were digging a foundation for another ITC building. At one end we cracked into a cave in the bedrock, with a glowing orb inside of it. An orb that was ten feet in diameter and swirling with mist that was every color of the rainbow. A few of the more adventurous of us examined the globe and stepped into it. Foolish, yes, but very exciting. We stepped out in a place where we stood on the inside of a sphere and looked up at a sun in the center. The walls, where we stood, wrapped around and joined overhead. We learned everyone called it Sphere. The story is incredible, but too long to narrate right now. Other than to say, we explored, we travelled back and forth to that place many times. We hired an engineer from there, to jump start ITC technologies. Your story makes as much sense as what I have seen, so I believe you. Who else have you told?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hesitated, then answered, "Inspector Lestrade."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lestrade? Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He is as observant as you. He already knew something was different. I knew I needed someone to talk to. Fortunately, he took it almost as well as you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are you going to tell Lucy and Mina? They've noticed as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, don't know," I answered slowly. "Do they know about your travels? Who esle knows?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not yet, no. I figure there's time to wait a bit longer. They will need to know in case something happens to me. The only people that know are the few of us in the original expedition."</p>
