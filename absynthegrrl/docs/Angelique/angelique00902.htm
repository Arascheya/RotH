<p class="pagecaption">London: 1888: Ripper - Talking to Mary</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jackson, at the Ten Bells, was able to give me Mary Kelly's address. She had moved to 13 Miller Court, just a little way from the Bells.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I found Mary sleeping one off when I arrived. For a long time I just sat and watched her. I had moved so far from when we were best friends. I wondered if she would even remember her distant friend.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I needn't have worried. When her eyes drifted open, she saw me, and leapt out of bed, grabbing me in a huge hug. "Emmy, where have you been? I looked around for you, but no one had seen you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry Mary. I had a chance at a position out of the city. It was a fluke, some toff I ran into. He was ok, just not long for life, it turns out. Now I'm back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have a place? You got work? You hear what happened to Polly, Anne, Lizzie, and Kate?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The news is everywhere, so I heard. Nobody knows why? Seems the police are useless."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They walk around, looking, but they never find anything. Only one is half good, and that's Lestrade. I think someone's holding him back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why would anyone do that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know why, Emmy. Something points to those with power. It's the way it's always been."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But who, Mary? Who would have power and still want to kill our friends?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have an idea. Remember back when the Street Sweeper was active? Remember that night we were at the Bells and you had enough that we could stay all night? There was that fancy coach and the woman getting into it as we left? We saw the same coach at several more disappearances since then."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But that was years ago. What changed? Did you tell someone?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, but we were seen. Lizzie wanted to know who it was, so we watched closer during last summer. It was maybe a week before Polly was killed when we saw it again. The man was chatting someone up and we tried to get close. He saw us and left, dragging the woman in as he fled. Her body washed up at the Wapping Stairs a couple of days later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you didnt tell anyone? Why not?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who would we tell, Emmy? The police? What a joke. The pimps? They wouldn't care, as long as they got paid. You weren't here to help us figure it out. I think he's coming for me next, Emmy. What can I do?"</p>
