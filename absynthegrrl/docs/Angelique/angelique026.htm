<p class="pagecaption">London: 1889: Dr. Petrie's Secret</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petrie and Lestrade were laughing about something when they came in. Lien Hua, Petrie's wife, and I were in her sanctum, a room outfitted in traditional Chinese furnishings. "Lady Marsters, didn't expect you to be here," Petrie said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Me, An,...ah, Lady Marsters," Lestrade stammered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Inspector, Dr.," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Looks like they are conspiring against us, Petrie," Lestrade joked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In a way we are," I smiled back. "I've talked with Lien and decided that Petrie should also know my background."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lestrade tured pale, "Are you sure?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. You need to be able to talk to your best friend, and I need to not have to be so careful when we talk." I took a deep breath and explained for the second time. I watched pity build in Perie's eyes, but he didn't say anything. "And now, for the proof," I said as I dropped the overlay. The pity gave way to complete shock. He sat back in his chair, pale as a ghost and trembling just a little. His fear carressed me, bringing the ever-present hunger. It barely ruffled my features.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You need not fear me. I will not harm you.I have lived with the hunger since my infection."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How can this be? Geof, how long have you known?" Petrie exclaimed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I tricked her into telling me a while ago," Lestrade replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That was you at the last ripper attack, wasn't it? That explains why Lestrade was so distraught at the scene and in the morgue. Can anything kill you?"His fear was fading fast as his curiosity took over.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I expect so, Dr. It would be hard, but the ripper alomst managed. I never did figure out what he had in his blood that was so toxic to me. If it hadn't been for that, I would have ended his game sooner."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lien rose and walked out of the room. A few minutes later she came in with small glasses of a deep golden liquid. "Lychee wine, made in my family's traditional way." She passed around the glasses and waited as we each sipped. A peaceful silence stretched on for some time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petrie was staring at me as I sipped the sweet wine. At last he broke the silence with, "Lady Marsters, or should I call you something else? I would like to ask you something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I waited for him to continue, finally saying, "Please, continue calling me Lady Marsters. Anything else might be difficult in public. What would you like to ask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As you know, I have been pulishing the Holmes stories, but I am getting a bit tired of the same old thing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What? No, I didn't know you were Conan Doyle."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um, ah, I thought Lestrade would have told you. Anyway, I want to write a book or two about the Eastern Menace. Wait, before you say anything, let me explain. I want to write them as if the British are the heroes, but in such a way that they come across as arogant buffoons. My 'enemy' should be the more sympathetic over time and the heroes less and less so. I had not been able to create a suitable opponent for my 'heroes', though. Could I use you, as regent of Egypt, as the inspiration?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I continued to sip the wine as I stared back at him. Once the tension had built I replied,"Perhaps. There would be a few rules. I have creative input on this character in terms of actions and personality and veto power if I don't like the way she is behaving. She must be scruplulously honorable when it comes to her word. She can be cruel, however, it should not be gratuitous. She cannot be vampyr, so we need to come up with a different way for her to be old and powerful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can accept those conditions," Petrie answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The basics evolved quickly, with all of us contributing. Lestrade helped define the British characters, three men, who knew each other slightly at the start of the adventures. Dr. Alexander Jekyllwas a respected doctor, working a private practice in one of the better London neighborhoods. Lord Fredrick Powell was an amateur archeologist and adventurer. Inspector Arthur Davies was a special investigator for Scotland Yard and was on roving assignment as needed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We had the most fun creating the antagonist, named Nefersheshet, a derivitive of Sheshat, the goddess of scribes. In an odd series of events, Sheshat was based off my time with Imhotep. He had insisted I find a symbol for myself, to mark the architecture I helped create. Over the years that symbol came to a goddess, said to help Pharaoh with the stretching of the cord, or the laying out of the foundations of new buildings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Our final character description was:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Nefersheshet was a tall woman, with the dark skin of the Near East. Her features were thin, hauty, and cold, with deep black eyes that cast shadows over everything they surveyed. Her voice was musical, soothing, and hypnotic, draining the vigor and resistance from any man who heard the sound of it. She moved with a cat's seductive grace and perfection, drawing the eye to her perfect, immodestly clad form.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Woe be to any man, standing without friend or protection in her presence. Many had been unmaned, sacrificing home, country, and fortune for one smile from that beautiful, cold face.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">She had the coldness of the East, an implacable disdain for the lives of others. She considered every being hers to use and discard at her whim. She was an embodiment of the unimaginable power of a ruler from the ancient depths of barbaric Egypt.The devil queen was awakened by investigations at Hatshepsut's Temple, where legends stated an ancient and virulent evil had been imprisoned.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"We shall never know the complete history of the devil queen," Fredrick Powell said. "I only know her attention was brought to the West by excavations at the Temple of Hatshepsut, a particularly degenerate and desperate queen of ancient egypt."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"The supersticious locals believe she has lived since the dawn of time, slumbering among the kings until a threat comes to Egypt. She rises to repell the threat, the sleeps again. Woe comes to any that seek to deliberately waken her. Many have tried, using an arcane ceremony, passed down through time, by the priests of the dead. The supplicant is the first sacrifice to the dread queen."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">She was schooled at the knee of Imhotep, an ancient of incredible knowledge and malignancy. He held within his inscrutible eastern countenance a host of malign and dark arts. All these he passed to Nefersheshet, as well as the skills to increase that dread knowledge throughout her long years. What secrets he imparted, what mysteries they explored, and how they granted her eternity, remain locked in the depths of her malice. What a boon to the sciences she could have been, had she used her stores of knowledge for the benefit of her betters, instead of their destruction.She founded the  Musaeum of Alexandria (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musaeum), a seat of learning in the ancient world, where she further honed her understanding of arcane and lost arts.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Her dress was a tube of linen extending from just below her breasts to her ankles. Two wide straps passed over her breasts and tied behind her neck. The linen was amzingly fine, supple, bleached to a startling white, and nearly transparent. One her feet she wore plain plaited leather sandals, exposing an indecent amount of foot and toes, to go with her general indecency.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had gone to the Petrie's to pick up additional ingredients from Lien Hua. She had been with several other customers and motioned for me to wait upstairs. I had found my way to the study, wanting to occupy my mind with some of Petrie's medical journals. Instead I found a stack of notes on his desk. I just glanced at them at first, not wanting to invade his privacy. The title of one caught my eye, it said, 'The Curse of the Devil Queen'. Under it were notes of three English characters, listed as fighting the Eastern Menace, embodied by a woman in the shadows, identified only as the Devil Queen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lien came in whle I was holding the pages. "I..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok. I think he wanted you to see those."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't understand. Won't this just play into the already overpowering anti-Eastern sentiment of the country?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes and no. Yes, it will sell because of the subject. No because of what he wants me to talk to you about. I'm supposed to ask if you would mind him basing the devil queen off you." I stared at her until she continued, "Lestrade had to explain a lot about you when he brought you here to heal. Then there's the ingredients you buy from me. They looked familiar, so I went digging. Ali Ahkmed, an acquaintance of mine, has several old parchments, passed down through his family. He claims they came from Alexandria. One of them is a list of items, very similar to the ones you order, stamped with the cartouch of Mereret, Regent of Cleopatra VII."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I remained silent, until she finished with, "John wants you to help him write a story that seems to be about brave white Enlishmen, battling an evil foce, but is written so the 'evil' queen is seen as the sympathetic character ad the heroes come off as arogant, patronizing bunglers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm curious, how much has Lestrade told you of me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Obviously, your rapid healing and special requirements for it. He has let slip and called you Mere and vampyr."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing more?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not directly, no. I have made some guesses, but none that I could validate. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I laughed then, "I could well be Petrie's devil queen. I can explain now, or when Petrie is here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When John arrives, would be good." Lien and I talked for hours until Petrie arrived. I knew she was a capable herbalist and apothecary, but had little idea of how broad her knowledge was. We talked of plants and animal toxins, and of their uses in medicines. In those hours I learned she was the truly brilliant one and a good partner for Petrie in his medical practice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lady Marsters," Petrie said as he walked in. "Good to see you again. Has my dear wife explained my questions for you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She has. Before we proceed, I need to explain more of my past to you. I must demand you give oaths to not reveal this to any other. It would be very dangerous for you and for me." Once they had given oaths, I explained, watching the pity grow in Petrie's eyes and the understanding in Lien's. When I had finished, I said, "And now for the proof." I shifted to myself, with the haughty look of the Regent on my features.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petrie's mouth opened in shock, but Lien smiled at me warmly. "These poor English. They expect the world to work as they see it. We, not of this land, know differently."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, Dr., I will help you with your stories, as long as you agree to follow my advice about the queen, without question. Her land is my land and I will not have it slandered." The last came out in the silky, purring voice I usually used when talking to particularly troublesome ministers, priests, of military commanders. It was a voice promising terrible consequences if my desires were denied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petrie backed up in his chair, then smiled, "Perfect! That is how I see the queen. Yes, of course, I agree completely!"</p>
