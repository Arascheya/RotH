<p class="pagecaption">London: 1887: The Theatre</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I met Lestrade at the private platform in Charing Cross Station. He had tickets to a Shakespeare play, he wanted to surprise me with which one. We took a cab from the station to the Lyceum and the opening night of Antony and Cleopatra. I knew a little bit about Shakespeare's plays from Angelique's memories, but not much about this one. Still, I could feel shivers of nerves run up my spine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I made it to the first intermission before I had to leave. It was all so wrong, my friend reduced to a love-lorn trollop and Antony to not much better. When the lights came up I had walked rapidly from the theatre and out to the street beyond. Lestrade found me leaning against one of the columns, white, shaking, with tears dripping down my cheeks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is it? Are you ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not here. I can't talk about it here. Take me back to the train." He flagged a cab and helped me into it. Back at the station, he led me to the train and settled me in a chair. "Would a drink help?" I nodded and he returned with a tall glass of wine. "Now, what's wrong?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The play, it's all wrong. Cleopatra was a pharaoh, a queen of her people. She loved Antony, sure, but not in the love sick way portrayed. They were leaders of powerful nations. There were wars, famine, social issues to deal with." I stood and paced to a window, staring out at the crowds moving around the public platforms. "we struggled to find a way to keep Egypt, to hold on to the empire. The Romans, thugs from the north, were pious, puritanical, uptight brutish pigs. They couldn't stand having a woman rule a nation that was richer, older, and more respected than theirs. It became a matter of honor for them to destroy our ways. I drank gallons of illuminating poison to try and find a way, any way, where we could live and keep our nation. Nothing would work. Nothing would prevent immeasurable loss of life. In the end, she killed herself and I fled back to Thebes and slept by my first love."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why did she kill herself?" I could hear a bit of the Christian fear of suicide in his voice, but there was more curiosity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Better to be dead than a captive queen of the Romans. They would have taken her to Rome in chains and paraded her through the city in a cage. It was intolerable, unthinkable."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You keep saying we tried this and that. What did you do in that time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was regent, advisor, a kind of chief of staff. You wondered at my poise. I have advised pharaohs from the 3rd dynasty until the end of the Egyptian Empire. I have commanded armies, dealt with the priests, ruled Egypt as pharaoh, without the title, when Cleopatra was away from Alexandria. Why should I bow and scrape to anyone in this time? Men took women's power by force, we did not give it up on our own. I refuse to subjugate myself just because this time expects it. They call our imprisonment 'admiration' but it's just another way of saying property."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nor should you give up your will," Lestrade said softly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's a very different opinion."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My aunt was a powerful woman of older ways. She taught me that men and women are equal and balance each other. It is something I try hard to remember when surrounded by the rest of the world. I have heard rumors that Lord Wellingham believes similarly. There are those at the yard that would like to bring him down for protecting women from the natural order of things." I could feel him watching me at the window. After a few moments he asked, "What is your real name again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mereret," I replied after a moment's hesitation. "Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to think of you as Mereret, the Egyptian pharaoh, not as Angelique Marsters, a woman of this time. Mereret is mysterious, powerful, and alive. Angelique, well, she could be, but I would fear her falling back into the patterns of this time." I said my name several times, until he could pronounce it correctly, in the language of my lands. I loved the way it flowed from his tongue when he got it right. "Would you show me yourself again, as the woman at the height of power?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I turned to stare at him, some of the power of myself showing in Angelique's face. He smiled encouragement and I swam from the pool. The gown hung loose about my shoulders. The women of London were larger than I had been. Then I let my face flow into that of regent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are so beautiful," he breathed. "This is how I shall think of you, regardless of the masks you must wear." I tried to keep the hauty expression, but couldn't stop the silly smile his words provoked. It didn't matter that I had lived thousands of years, flattery still felt good.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I started to shift back but his small head shake stopped me. Instead I settled into a chair across from him. "Where do we go from here, Inspector?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should arrest you for the murder of the Marsters family and the Whitechapel killings," I held my hands out, having seen enough arrests in Whitechapel, "but many of your deeds have helped the yard. No one would believe me anyway unless you were to confess?" I shook my head, "I didn't think so. You've put me in a very bad spot, Mereret. I like you, I have from the first night we met and you have given me your trust." He stood, agitation forcing him to pace around the room. "You can't do that, can you? Force someone to like and trust you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, no. Only through the usual ways," it wasn't completely true, of course, but I hadn't used the persuasion on him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know where we go from here. This is beyond anything I expected. What about you? This becoming a Marsters places you in a spotlight and brings you access to rather large amounts of power and money. Are your intentions honorable or will I be forced to oppose you later?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is a storm coming, an upheaval beyond any that have been seen before. Visions tell me I can be of use, can make it less terrible, but I have to be entangled with the Wellinghams, and with..." I stopped, not wanting to tell the rest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lestrade seemed to miss the last part, instead asking, "What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I dug into the fragments, trying to find something that could be explained. "The world stands on the verge of a terrible war, one that will roll over Europe and kill millions. Power mad dabblers in non-rational things are working to release horrors in the hopes of attaining more power. The Wellinghams are central to avoiding these terrors. I haven't seen how, yet." I looked at him, standing across from me, and saw determination and confusion, but not disbelief. "You are not as you seem either, inspector."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you said you couldn't change what happened in Egypt. How can you change this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sometimes there are events in motion that there is no way to shift, the momentum is too great and the alternatives too awful. Other times there are small points, little cracks or weak spots in the forces that can still be turned or nudged. In the years after I returned to sleep, I could see several I had missed in the last times. Maybe the illuminating poison had me too focused, or maybe my love of Cleopatra blinded me. Although, there are hints that any change would have resulted in the same outcome, just with different costs."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You and Aunt Nell would like each other. You speak of similar things. You mentioned illuminating poison, what is that? Can you actually channel your visions, get coherent answers from them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Illuminating poison is just as it sounds. It drives the visions deeper, keeps them happening for longer stretches, but can introduce distortions. It is a poison because it would kill any not of my kind. As to the visions, they are always true, in one form or another, it's all in the interpretation and nuance. As for coherent answers, that's much more complicated. Other seers can muddy the waters, events aren't as clear as they could be, and there is still infinite variation in possibility. Pray that never goes away because the alternative is too terrible to imagine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I understand..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What would a world be like if everything was predictable, known, and unchangeable?" Lestrade nodded in understanding, the light of it revealed in his eyes. "You are a remarkable man, Inspector. I have met few who could even begin to understand." I could still see confusion in his face as I sat and watched him. I was waiting for something, but wasn't quite sure until he spoke again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do we need to do next?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I smiled at my ally and said, "I need to create some illuminating poison. It distorts the visions, but it shows shadows of others muddying the waters. I need to know how many others are trying to see."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tell me again of your past lives, Mereret."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Lestrade can see magic - he needs to talk to Mere about it and wonders why she doesn't glow like the sun with what she can do - vampyrites are more tech than magic */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Ange considered Cleo to be one of the good pharaohs */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Cleo loved Marcus Antonius - made some bad choices because of it, but shouldn't have been earth-shattering */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* powerful woman, with immense wealth and the food source for Rome, in a time where misogynists were on the rise */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* sometimes there is a momentum such that enough force cannot be brought to bear on it to shift the path - such was the time - I could find no way to shove hard enough to keep Egypt free and Cleo alive */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* socially progressive, politically backward - women's rights, god-empress mode of rule - need for good advisors and administrators - Mere would insure good people when she was behind the throne */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* main conversation takes place in the private train car - this could spawn gossip - especially if this meeting is shortly after the high visibility murder investigation of Ange's parents */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* gossip machine will prompt Uncle Richard to bluster, threaten, and attempt to wrest Ange back from the Wellinghams */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* misses the taste of the illuminating poison more than the effects. after drinking gallons of it through the Cleo years, she became used to it, maybe addicted to it - possible Lestrade will suggest a visit to Lien Hua for ingredients or a substitute */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* burned out on pomp and circumstance - she realizes the "tools of statecraft" aspects of it, but is not a fan, having gone through the stage of liking it, craving it, relishing it, and then burning out on it - she and valen have a lot in common based on years of leadership and political gaming */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Lestrade appreciates someone else he can talk about the "torn veil" with. He can sort of talk to Lien Hua and can completely talk to his aunt, but they are the only others. Mere is close, intelligent, and has millenia of insight */</p>
