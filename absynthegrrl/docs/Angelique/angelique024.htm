<p class="pagecaption">London: 1883: Street Sweeper</p>

<p class="regtxt5">London was a weird mix. To the west, where the well to do lived, was almost a paradise. The East End was a cesspit, full of depravity, squallor, and soul crushing poverty. People begged, stole, and scrounged filth from the streets to survive. Even the worst pharaohs I had seen didn't treat the citizens with such casual cruelty.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had started out from Flower and Dean Street, where Lizzie was letting me stay. By the time evening was coming, I had wandered far and was into the nicer parts of town. The later it got, the more unfriendly looks I started getting from the well-dressed. I darted into a quiet alley when one of them stopped a policeman and pointed in my direction.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My initial assessment proved right. I could move about as long as I did not cross class boundaries. I would need a different set of clothing if I wanted to venture deep into the other sections of town.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was starving by the time I arrived back at Flower and Dean. It didn't make any sense, having fed well the night before, until I coughed up black sludge from my lungs. The it became all too clear. My body was working at a frantic rate to stay healthy. Problem was, how to select food.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The problem sorted itself out when I heard a fist hit flesh. Just around the corner on the alley connecting Flower and Dean and Fashion, a tough was smacking around a woman not much past girlhood. I shoved him off her and yelled at the girl, "Run!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He snarled at me, "You'll be sorry. McKennough's crew will cut you up for this, cunny." I smiled, sunk my teeth into his throat, and fed. I took his knife and cut out the teeth marks when I was done, throwing the remains to a starving dog sniffing through the trash. What little coin he had, I appropriated. I stared down at the blood stains on my only remaining dress, angry at the corpse for making the mess, then angry at myself for not considering it, then angry at this place for the brutality I had just stopped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I turned to return to the room, then stopped and thought. I couldn't undo the horrible system that caused the misery around me, but I could clean out some of the sewage that prowled the streets, feeding off the rest. Turning back to the alley, I shifted to another overlay. This one was of a murdered woman I had found in Cairo. She was dying when I found her and had begged me to take a message to her family. I had done one better. After taking her message, I took her form and killed her attacker. Slowly the form of Rebecca Thornton surfaced. My stained dress hung loose on her slight frame. Rebecca was a young, innocent looking woman of mixed Egyptian and English descent. An exotic beauty in these surroundings, and a likely target for the thugs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The other end of the alley let out onto Fashion, where I turned right and headed deeper into the close warrens and press of people. I sought out the darker places, looking for another thug to take. A man slipped up behind me and wrapped an arm around me, saying, "How about a bit of fun?" I spun, a snarl on my face. He backed up fast and scared, "I'm sorry. I just wanted a little fun. I have money."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not tonight. It's been a bad day," I said, trying to calm the rage. He nodded once and ran. I had thought I could do it, let them touch me, fondle me, and get close enough to assess. It would take a different strategy. I had lived as a respected person too long for the kind of contact these men expected.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was going to head back to the room, until I thought about showing up, covered in blood. I had enough money for the room, but not enough to replace my clothes. The police routed anyone trying to sleep in the parks, on benches, or anywhere else there was a flat surface. Shelters were far between and Lizzie had explained the odd arrangements for getting in and the cost of help. Eventually I slipped closer to Christ Church and the surrounding buildings. Careful examination showed I could climb one of the nearer buildings. It took a very long time until no one was looking and I could get a start.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The roof was quiet and empty, perfect for catching sleep, except for the hard, cold windy aspects. It was a long, cold night, but I could draw on the trance state from my necklace. I did not sleep right away, too many thoughts were banging around in my head. I could start cleaning up around the area, but I would have to have an area to stash clothes for the various overlays. Lizzie's would be a good place for Emily to live, but Rebecca would have to disappear between hunts. That meant a place to change, a place to stash her clothes, and a place that wouldn't be found by my fellow squatters.</p>
