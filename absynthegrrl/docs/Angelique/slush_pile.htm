<p class="regtxt5">older stuff</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I ended up in Whitechapel. Just as in Cairo I found the poor were more friendly as a general rule. They still knew they needed others to help them get by. Amarna, another woman from my lands, let me share a small apartment in the basement of a rooming house. She had a breathing disease of some kind. She shook with rattling coughs and for long minutes at a time could scarcely catch her breath, yet she was happy most of the time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Our place was two rooms in the basement of a tumble down row house on Flower and Dean Street. It stank and leaked, but it kept us off the streets and out of the minds of the law. It was also in a section of London where nasty people came and went. It was easy for me to start feeding on the bullies and monsters of the region. They were rarely missed and the local law enforcers didn't bother to investigate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Amarna gave me a name to use in the city. She called me Kamilah saying Mereret was too difficult and would make me too remarkable. The trick of the poor, she always said, was to remain invisible to the rich. She taught me her trade as well. She was a washerwoman for a lower middle class family. One that couldn't afford to have live in servants. She explained I was a cousin of hers that had just arrived and she wanted me to learn a trade. The family was understanding, even allowing me to fill in for Amarna on days when she couldn't work.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was still hard for me to comprehend the vast wealth of this new place. Anyone not dirt poor had as much or more than most of the nobility of my time. The middle classes and above had more wealth than any of the pharaohs I had known. The only difference was they didn't have the absolute power of a pharaoh.</p>
