<p class="pagecaption">London: 1887: Wellinghams</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was in a carriage with Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard. Angelique hadn't known much about him other than he was a high profile inspector, with many cases to his credit. He had treated me kindly and had shown a keen mind and deep insight to the murders at the Marsters home. He was also not the sallow, rat-faced, and dark-eyed incompetent described in the Holmes stories. Instead he was a smart dresser, with a kind, open face, neatly trimmed moustache and beard, with warm brown eyes and a delightful smile. I had warmed to him but had to be careful not to reveal too much to him. He was far more observant and analytical than the Holmes stories painted him. Something that seemed at odds with what I had observed about the police I had encountered in Whitechapel.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lestrade's sudden intake of breath roused me from my contemplation of him. "I had heard the Wellingham holdings were impressive, but I never expected this." The road had left the thinning edges of London housing and entered a more rustic setting. It ended at an enormous gate set in a brick wall. Normally a house would be close to the gate, but in this case the road continued into a thick woodland. A guard house sat to the left of the gate with warm light coming from the windows and smoke curling from the chimney. As we pulled to a stop a richly appointed guard stepped out. "Good evening. Please state your business here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Inspector Lestrade and Lady Angelique Marsters to see Lord Wellingham," Lestrade answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The guard sketched a small bow. "We've been expecting you. Please proceed." He turned back to the open door and called, "Eric, ring the house and let Lord Willem know his guests have arrived." He walked to the gates, unlocked them, and pushed them open.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The road snaked through woods, crossed a narrow stretch of water between two large lakes, then followed the lake shore west and slightly south for another half mile or so. Images licked at the edges of my mind as the carriage wound threw the woods. They pushed in closer as we emerged from a stand of trees and circled up to an enormous mansion. By the time we reached the mansion they were slamming into me so hard and fast that I couldn't pass out, couldn't move, and couldn't answer Lestrae's last comment. He touched me to bring me back and I shattered in a spill of light and dark fragments, slipping into darkness and relief.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">I awoke to a strong, nasty smell, kind of like piss on a hot day only far more intense. I saw Lestrade, Dr. Petrie, a red haired woman, an older red haired woman, a black haired woman, and an older man through watery eyes. Angelique's memories supplied their names. Lucy was the red head, Mina the dark haired one, the older man was Lord Willem Wellingham, and the older woman was Lady Anne Wellingham. I was in a large bed, near the edge, and Dr. Petrie was stoppering a small vial. "Back among the living now, Lady Marsters?" he asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think so," I replied. Random images kept flitting through my head, but they were vague enough and slow enough that I could ignore them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh Ange, I'm so sorry," Lucy began, with Mina echoing the sentiments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe we should let Angelique rest now?" Lady Wellingham broke in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, Lady Wellingham. I might have a few more questions tomorrow, but I would recommend getting Lady Marsters settled for the night. If there is nothing else?" Lestrade looked at me briefly, "I will be on my way. Take my card and call me immediately if you remember anything else. You will be alright here, won't you, Lady Marsters?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I took the offered card and replied, "Yes, Inspector. Thank you for escorting me. And you may contact me if you need anything. My home, the scene of the, well, my home is yours until this dreadful thing is finished." He smiled, bowed, touched his lips to my hand briefly, and left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dr. Petrie, would you have laudanum in case Angelique can't sleep?" Mina asked, as Petrie turned to follow Lestrade.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course," he replied, pulling a small bottle from his bag. "Remember to start with a small dose. I don't know her tollerence for it. Call me at this number if she needs attention," he added as he passed a card to Mina.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh Ange, he fancies you, how positivity brash!" Lucy added, once Lestrade and Petrie were out of the room. "You must bring him around again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know Ange is betrothed to Stephen Abernathy," Mina said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Abernathy's too ordinary for Ange. She should have better than him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should let Ange rest, shouldn't we Lucy? This has been a tragic day for her," Mina asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is a tragedy about James, but I never liked the others."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lucinda! It is acceptable to have your own opinions about people, however, you should temper your speech with kindness when talking to others," Lord Wellingham stated.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry. You are right, father. Ange, please forgive me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are forgiven. I share your thoughts on step-mother, however, my father did have a few moments and I will miss him. Lord Wellingham, may we do something for Edward? He was never bad to me and he deserves much better than his mother's family will show him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I will see to it in the morning. Angelique, please call me uncle or Willem, Lord Wellingham is for those that are not family."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lucy, Mina, could you stay with me? I don't want to be alone yet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ange, we have night clothes that should fit you. Would you like to change out of your evening wear?" Lucy asked. I nodded and she hurried out, returning a few minutes laterwith the items. I stood on shaky legs, stripped and slid into the waiting garments. Lucy and Mina glanced at each other and then back at me. Too late I realized Angelique was very modest normally. "You take the center." I slid in and they curled up next to me. Images crashed over me in torrents, so fast and furious to be unrecognizable. I whimpered, moaned, and bit my tongue so hard I almost drowned on my own blood. Fear poured off my companions in waves, but they cuddled tighter and held on to me while tears drenched the pillow and my shaking tried to throw them away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I rode the waves for an eternity, barely conscious but unable to stop them or pass out. They tumbled over each other, slipping and sliding, aligning and splitting apart, in pattern after pattern. I had seen nexus points before, with Hatshepsut and Cleopatra, but never to the scale of this. So many images were of things I couldn't understand at the time. Over the years I learned they were empires of galactic scale, places throughout the multi-verse, and peoples no one had yet dreamed of on my tiny blue rock. I clung to the tapestries as long as I could, trying to understand what was needed, until darkness finally fell.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Warmth enfolded me as I awoke. Two sets of sleepy eyes watched me as Lucy asked, "Are you ok now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You scared us quite a bit last night. Would you want to talk about the nightmares? You were whimpering pretty loudly for quite a while," Mina added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The images remained, hovering just out of conscious access, still shifting and moving but without the brain scorching intensity of the previous evening. "I am better, I think. It was so awful, coming home and finding them." For a moment I was tempted to tell them what had happened, but discarded the notion immediately as profoundly foolish.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We took breakfast in a pleasant little alcove with a glorious view of the gardens. The butler came in as we neared the end of breakfast with an envelope on a silver tray. He placed it before me and said, "Lady Marsters, this came for you in the morning deliveries."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly I picked it up and cut it open. Inside was a short note from Lestrade asking that I meet with him at Scotland Yard at mid day. Lucy and Mina grinned at me and said, almost at once, "You could take a cab, but there is a much better way. Father may we..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, you may use the train, once I'm at work. Take the south loop to Charing Cross Station. Scotland Yard is just down Whitehall Place."</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">A few hours later Lucy led me out of the drawing room and onto the private platform, where a medium sized engine panted quietly at the head of a train of three cars, tender, baggage wagon, and coach. Mina stepped onto the small platform at the front of the coach, opened the door, and motioned for me to step on. Lucy headed toward the engine to talk with the engineer. The inside of the coach was plush carpet, ornate, glossy glowing woodwork, and enormous stuffed chairs. A couple of small tables were drawn up close to clusters of the chairs. At the front was a side board holding decanters and glasses.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes after Lucy returned and settled into a chair the train began to move. I watched out the windows, fascinated by the expanses of Wellingham land. We talked a little about nothing, but mostly I watched the world move by. "Mina and I need to get a few things while we are here. Come back to the train when you are finished. We'll leave when the last of us is on board," Lucy said as we pulled into the station.</p>
