<p class="regtxt5">"Lizzie!!" my own shout woke me from the horrible dream but the images didn't fade. Instead they intensified until I could barely see the room around me through the view of blood pouring from her throat and pooling on the rough stone where she fell. A dark figure turned at the sound of footsteps in the distance and cursed under his breath. I gathered up rough clothes and pulled them on as fast as I could then ran for the door. "Benson, the carriage, quickly!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes mum." I heard him racing down the steps, shouting for the carriage driver as he went.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The driver was pulling his coat on in the kitchen when I arrived. "Mum, the carriage will be ready shortly. Where will we be going?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bricklayer's Arms Pub, Whitechapel, as quickly as we can and try to avoid constabulary interactions please." He paled visibly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mum, at this time of..." his voice trailed off as he saw my look. "Yes mum, Sorry mum." We took off downthe streets, going as fast as safety allowed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Leave me and find somewhere to wait," I told him as we approached the pub. He muttered an affirmative and drove off slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stared into the red pool, then dragged imaginary fingers threw it. A small yard and an empty street shimmered into view. Lizzie walked slowly down it, arms entangled with a dark man. A sign behind them said "The Nelson". I was running as I pulled back from the pool. Down Settles, across Commercial, and then a right onto Fairclough. Ahead a small knot of police and people stared at something. "Lizzie!" It came out a frantic shout as I ran up. A burly policeman turned to stop my head-long rush.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hold up there. Do you know the deceased?" He stared at me, then asked almost kindly, "We need someone to identify the deceased. Are you able to help?" I swallowed hard and nodded. He stepped aside and let me look at the scene. It was exactly as I had expected, down to the last detail.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's Lizzie, Elizabeth Stride. We are, were friends."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Easy, there'll be time for you to tell us what you know later. For now, let the others work." Several hours went by as they looked us all over for blood or other signs of struggle, took our statements, and let us leave. PC Lamb, the constable who had stopped me at first, stopped me again. "I have a question before you go. You came running up like you expected trouble, yet no one saw you here earlier. Would you care to explain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We...we were supposed to meet at the Bricklayer's, ah Bricklayer's Arms and then head out to...ah...to... And I missed her there so then I headed over toward The Nelson, sometimes we meet there and..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So you were going out together tonight. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...we...needed money for this guy, he threatened to cut me up so I couldn't work for not paying him enough protection. And no, I won't give you a name. He'd kill me before you could stop him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That won't do, miss. This is a murder investigation. I'm going to have to ask you to come talk to the inspector." He gentley took her arm and lead her to another man. "Cheif Inspector, this young woman wishes to report a threat against herself and the deceased."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* leave her at a place near the scene - she is hoping to get there before the event - she arrives too late */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the Ripper Killinngs were happening I was already living as Angelique with Lucy and Mina. It was almost a year after I had killed Angelique's family.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the fourth killing London was climbing the walls. Those in Spitalfields and Whitechapel that I knew even more than most. I had known Catherine Eddowes by sight, although we rarely spoke. Lizzie Stride was a different matter. We had been friends since the second time I saw her at the Ten Bells. With her death I began my own hunt to end the terror. It was no simple task for the police had mucked about and had evidence, lost evidence, destroyed evidence. I tried for most of October to find any clue to what had happened, even sampling various witnesses, but none of the data was conclusive, every description and view was different.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By early November I had all but given up. I had no visions and no one I knew had any more idea than I did. I had decided on one last try the night of November 8th. Slipping back into the Emily Crooksley overlay I returned to my old haunts in Spitalfields, stopping in to the Ten Bells for a pint and not staying long. The place felt empty without Lizzie there. I took a quick turn down Commercial and then slipped into the Britannia for a pint and a break from the chill. Mary waved me over to where she was leaning heavily against the bar. "Emmy, ha a drink wi me," she slurred out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure Mary." I lifted a pint and the room wavered. I sagged back and would have fallen if Mary hadn't caught me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Emmy, ya ok, luv? Another o' yer spells?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When she touched me I saw a knife in the hand of a well-dressed animal carving pieces out of Mary where she lay on her bed. "Ah," I couldn't speak as I clung to her, each image more horrible than the last.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I got ya," she said again as she helped me to a table. I fell into the chair and bounced my head on the surface. The pain pierced the cascade for a moment. "Emmy?" her voice was all fear as she pulled my head up and tried to gaze into my unfocused eyes. "Emmy!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mary," I managed to whisper through the cotton in my mouth.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I' ere, what ya need, luv?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The images shifted slightly. "Gin, in a glass," I croaked out and pressed coins into her hand. She headed for the tapman and the images shifted again. She put the almost full glass in my hand, her fingers briefly touching mine, and the images exploded again. This time the knife came for my throat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Emmy?" Mary said as she pulled back from me. It took me a moment to realize and remove the predatory grin that had crept over my face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mary?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wha was 'at?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tha face ya made."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just longing for the gin. Did you get one for yourself too?" She shook her head and I pressed a few more coins into her hand. "Don't make me drink alone." She smiled and went to get herself a glass. By the time she returned I was almost back to normal and trying to piece together the changes. "What brings you out tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tha landlor's comin fer me money in tha mornin, an' i'm out ta get it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can lend you some, how much you need?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Emmy, I can't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure you can. You helped me, now I can help you." I pressed some money into her hand. "How about I help you home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need to get Mary somewhere safe before assuming her appearance - has she sampled Mary or does she need to now? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she can use some visions to get needed data - just remember the dissociation with reality is slowly getting worse when she does - from Mary finds out he is looking for people who saw him dumping bodies, Mary was one, from contact with the ripper she finds out he has been engaged in experimentation with various missing persons for years - body count is closer to 15 to 20 - finds out he was connected with London Hospital and sees his home/work area - consider having the ripper "kill" mereret and then her having to slip out of the morgue and hunt him down, knowing her friend is still in danger from him - alternately, he kills her and takes her body because of the odd things he observed while interacting with her - leaves lots of blood but no body in Mary's room */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* after she deals with the ripper, she finds Borusa and sets him up in Jekyl's house and job */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* victims - Mary Ann Nichols 31 Aug 1888 - Annie Chapman 8 Sept 1888 - Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddows 30 Sept 1888 - Mary Jane Kelly 9 Nov 1888 */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* for a serial, there is quite a gap between Sept and Nov - there should be others, just not found, that Ang finds out about when she take down the killer */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* the attack */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He followed me into Mary's room, a simple affair with a small grate, a bed, a table, and a small wardrobe. I pulled the hat off and smiled, "Make yourself comfortable. How do you want me?" He moved past me and I grabbed him, sunk my fangs in, and started the injection. His blood hit my throat and I choked. Spots swam in front of my eyes and I doubled over, poisoned by something in his blood. He hauled me up by my hair and threw me onto the bed. I curled tightly around the fire in my throat and guts. His knife flashed across my throat and blood exploded everywhere. The pain was a bright flash, but I couldn't sceam. Frantic, I shoved up and managed to get a bite on his arm. Drawing the half sample in as he backhanded me onto the bed again. The knife flashed again and again, tearing through my skin, slashing across my face, chest, abdomen and legs. Conciousness faded fast as blood poured from me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* in Mary's room - police */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Idiot girl, You didn't tell me you were going tonight. I almost didn't hear about this." Lestrade hissed in my ear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you say something inspector?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, just surprised at the state of the body. Where's Abberline and do we have any witnesses?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, sir. A few who said they saw her come in with a gentleman, but no descriptions and no one saw when he left. Wish they would have sent the dogs. Can't even tell if she was a pretty one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She... It shouldn't matter, PC Lamb. She is still the victim."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, sir, was just wondering. What he did to her face isn't right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want this bastard caught!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you alright sir?" Lamb asked, catching the strain in Lestrade's voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I want this killer caught. I want our city to be free of this constant fear. Has someone sent for Dr. Petrie? We should get a post mortem and then get the poor girl out of here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I drifted in and out of awareness until I heard Lestrade again. "Doctor, let us know when we can move her to the morgue."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course." For a long while there was the sound of a pen on paper as the doctor examined me, then he said, "Ok, you can move her. Have the body taken to the London Hospital morgue. I'll do the final examinations there." I had thought I was beyond the pain of the injuries until they lifted me and carried me to a cart.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* post mortem - details of injuries - from <a href="http://www.casebook.org/victims/mary_jane_kelly.html">Casebook.org</a> */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dr. Thomas Bond, a distinguished police surgeon from A-Division, was called in on the Mary Kelly murder. His report is as follows:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The body was lying naked in the middle of the bed, the shoulders flat but the axis of the body inclined to the left side of the bed. The head was turned on the left cheek. The left arm was close to the body with the forearm flexed at a right angle and lying across the abdomen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The right arm was slightly abducted from the body and rested on the mattress. The elbow was bent, the forearm supine with the fingers clenched. The legs were wide apart, the left thigh at right angles to the trunk and the right forming an obtuse angle with the pubes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The whole of the surface of the abdomen and thighs was removed and the abdominal cavity emptied of its viscera. The breasts were cut off, the arms mutilated by several jagged wounds and the face hacked beyond recognition of the features. The tissues of the neck were severed all round down to the bone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The viscera were found in various parts viz: the uterus and kidneys with one breast under the head, the other breast by the right foot, the liver between the feet, the intestines by the right side and the spleen by the left side of the body. The flaps removed from the abdomen and thighs were on a table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bed clothing at the right corner was saturated with blood, and on the floor beneath was a pool of blood covering about two feet square. The wall by the right side of the bed and in a line with the neck was marked by blood which had struck it in a number of separate splashes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The face was gashed in all directions, the nose, cheeks, eyebrows, and ears being partly removed. The lips were blanched and cut by several incisions running obliquely down to the chin. There were also numerous cuts extending irregularly across all the features.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The neck was cut through the skin and other tissues right down to the vertebrae, the fifth and sixth being deeply notched. The skin cuts in the front of the neck showed distinct ecchymosis. The air passage was cut at the lower part of the larynx through the cricoid cartilage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Both breasts were more or less removed by circular incisions, the muscle down to the ribs being attached to the breasts. The intercostals between the fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs were cut through and the contents of the thorax visible through the openings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The skin and tissues of the abdomen from the costal arch to the pubes were removed in three large flaps. The right thigh was denuded in front to the bone, the flap of skin, including the external organs of generation, and part of the right buttock. The left thigh was stripped of skin fascia, and muscles as far as the knee.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The left calf showed a long gash through skin and tissues to the deep muscles and reaching from the knee to five inches above the ankle. Both arms and forearms had extensive jagged wounds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The right thumb showed a small superficial incision about one inch long, with extravasation of blood in the skin, and there were several abrasions on the back of the hand moreover showing the same condition.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On opening the thorax it was found that the right lung was minimally adherent by old firm adhesions. The lower part of the lung was broken and torn away. The left lung was intact. It was adherent at the apex and there were a few adhesions over the side. In the substances of the lung there were several nodules of consolidation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The pericardium was open below and the heart absent. In the abdominal cavity there was some partly digested food of fish and potatoes, and similar food was found in the remains of the stomach attached to the intestines."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dr. George Bagster Phillips was also present at the scene, and gave the following testimony at the inquest:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The mutilated remains of a female were lying two-thirds over towards the edge of the bedstead nearest the door. She had only her chemise on, or some underlinen garment. I am sure that the body had been removed subsequent to the injury which caused her death from that side of the bedstead that was nearest the wooden partition, because of the large quantity of blood under the bedstead and the saturated condition of the sheet and the palliasse at the corner nearest the partition.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The blood was produced by the severance of the carotid artery, which was the cause of death. The injury was inflicted while the deceased was lying at the right side of the bedstead."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* morgue */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's going on, Geof?" Petrie asked from beside my body.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean John?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Look at this, right here," I felt a sharp poke at some of the flesh on my ribs. "There should be necrosis and drying in these tissues, yet they look freshly cut. According to this, she would have to have died in the last half hour, yet we know that isn't true." Lestrade must have reacted because the doctor added, "This one means something to you. You aren't usually this distracted or bothered by a victim you don't know. What's your connection to this woman?" I heard them move away and sounds of equipment being moved. There was a sharp intake of breath, then, "Geof, look at this. Her cells are regenerating. This isn't possible. What do you know about this girl? More than I'd expect, judging by your look."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can't talk here and we need to get her out of here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's not dead, is she?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"no, she's not. I have some room at my place, once we get her there, I'll try and explain. Trust me, please John."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* after MAry Kelly attack */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I heard his voice from a great distance, swearing as he tripped over something in the room. The chair creaked slightly as he sat close to me and warmth enfloded my left hand as he wrapped his fingers around mine. "You fool, he hissed. Do you know how hard it was to get you out of the morgue? I told them someone had come to claim you, but I'm not sure they belived it. You better be alive in there. What were you thinking, pulling a stupid stunt like this?" I wanted to wake up and tell him he had agreed when I'd suggested it, but I wasn't that far along yet. A single tear escaped and tracked down the ruins of my face. "So you are alive. I wish to hell you'd told me what I could do to help you heal."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* this is several days later - she should be down for over a week - Lestrade will need to tell the Wellinghams something */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I forced my right hand to move, first pointing at the crude bandages, then miming drinking. It took many tries before he said, Blood, you want blood? Oh, squeeze my hand once for yes, twice for no." I squeezed once. "The hospital won't have blood." I squeezed twice. "It can be animal blood?" One squeeze. "I'll be back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/*Mary can reappear after the killer is dealt with - Ange could have to take him on when partially healed to protect Mary - will need Lestrade and Petrie to help */</p>
