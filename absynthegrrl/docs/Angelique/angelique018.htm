<p class="pagecaption">Cairo: 1881</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I arrived in Cairo near evening. Good news because it let me slip away from the boat without answering questions. There were several languages being spoken in the shadows I walked through. None of my samplings had given me enough to understand anything but the vague idea of what was being said. I tried to find the poor section of town, made easier by following the more traditional clothes. Even the language there had drifted quite far from what I had spoken the last time I was awake.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* what is she wearing? Where did she get it? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cairo, how the city had changed since the times of Cleopatra. Strange new architecture sprouted up from the old. Entire sections existed that had been empty lands before. Light skinned people walked among the peoples I recognized, dressed in fashions even more odd than the buildings. Tight clothes, created of heavy fabrics kept them pink and dripping with sweat while the rest bowed, scraped, but remained comfortable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had sampled a few people during my trip to the city, but the knowledge hadn't prepared me for the reality. In the end I settled in the poor parts of town. Customs were looser, the clothing more normal, and the crashing waves of difference stopped at the edges. Careful sampling added to my knowledge and to my confusion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everywhere things had gotten meaner. This 'Age of Enlightenment' had increased the differences between the rich, the powerful, and the rest. The need to cooperate for mutual survival had faded from the times I was used to. The poor still had some of it, not because they were better, but because they couldn't afford to ignore the problems of their neighbors. The state of women was even worse. Now we were viewed as breeding cattle, kept pampered, when possible, ignorant, and powerless in every strata. The reasons were complex, but at the heart of it were the new religions, the monotheistic ones, based around a patriarchal father figure and demanding obedience and heirarchy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The old sections of Ciro were more like I remembered. The houses were small, thick walled, with flat roof for sleeping on. The newer sections of town showed the influence of the latest invaders. Their buildings soaked up and trapped the heat, were drafty to the wind blown dust and heat, and poorly constructed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I met Chione through her youngest daughter. She ran at me as I was walking through one of the poorer markets and tried to drag me to her mother's stall. She reminded me of Hatshepsut as a child, a curious mix of fearless, shy, and curious. Smitten, I followed her to the stall and looked over the wares.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Caught another one, did you Ashta?" The woman asked her young daughter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, mama. I like her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You like everyone, Ashta."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No I don't. The goat-man smells bad and is mean. The boy at the knife tent stares too much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I smiled at the woman, looked at her wares, and turned to start away. Ashta grabbed my hand and insisted on introducing me to her doll. "This is Bastis. I named her after an old god, but momma says I mustn't tell that to just anyone. I'm Ashtarchemosh but everyone calls me Ashta. What's your name?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm called Mereret. Your mother is right. Some people are strange about the old ways."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You talk funny. Like old Binebtat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ashta," her mother started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok. I know I speak strangely. My parents were very traditional in my upbringing." I winked at Ashta. "They taught me of the old ways too, and gave me the same warning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Momma, can Mereret come for dinner?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ashta, Mereret might have other things to do today."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* stays with Chione and her man, in the poor section for a couple of years, learning as much as she can and having the need to go to London amplify in her visions */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* something prompts a dive in the Red Pool and the knowledge of Asylum, Sphere, and some of the nature of the multi-verse is revealed */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need to make this more personal - the shock, the oddness, how she learns to cope and reconcile knowledge of it with the reality of it - in the past, things changed slowly enough that she wasn't too far out of sync after a sleep */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* items to think about: fashion, social structure, religion - monotheism vs pantheism, war and the tools of it, foriegn power groups controlling her homeland */</p>
