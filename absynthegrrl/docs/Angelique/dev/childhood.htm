<p class="pagecaption">Angelique Childhood</p>

<!--<p class="regtxt5">I was born in Iunu, uh I guess it's where part of Cairo is now, in the time of Netjerikhet Djoser. I was the middle child in a family of boys. My father was a stone artisan under the guidance of Imhotep, chief architect to the nesu. I dreamt of growing up, marrying an artisan like my father, and having a large family. Maybe my husband would be noticed by Imhotep and promoted like my father.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Iunu was a great place to be. The nesu was always commissioning works from the artisans and Imhotep, vizier, architect, and high priest was there. My father was one of his overseers at the stone works. Our house was spacious and cool in the summers. There was plenty of food and a fair variety from the bounty of Iteru, the Nile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My brothers and I would play with the other children in the stone workers quarter. There were balls to throw, the river to swim in, and stones and such to make houses out of. When we were older we'd play nesu and subjects, family games with doll children, or find old tools from our parents and pretend we were learning their trade.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There were many festivals during my childhood. Great times of dancing, singing, consumption of too much beer, and distribution of special foods by the nobility. When I was older and a servant of Imhotep, festivals were an even more wonderful occasion with meats of all kinds and fancy sweet foods.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Things started to fall apart when I first bled. That night I dreamt of an accident at the stonecutters where one of the workmen was crushed between two blocks. The next day my father came home and told us of an accident exactly as I had seen it. I kept quiet, it couldn't have been real I kept telling myself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It happened again near the flood time. This time it was a group of fishermen losing several of their crew to Iteru. I tried to ignore the dreams but they kept coming, often close to my time or close to the floods. As I grew older they came more frequently. I struggled to not say anything. After a dream I would be distant and withdrawn until I heard the results. Then I would be distant and depressed. My mother had to have noticed but she said nothing. She would ask me to do simple tasks on the days where I was distracted and she would slip me my favorite dried dates at meals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tried to keep the dreams from interfering with my hopes of husband and family but I was getting the reputation of the strange one in Iunu. A boy I had been interested in stopped coming around and took up with the daughter of my neighbor. They were married when I was fourteen years. That was when I got the tattoo that seems to shock you so much. I begged my mother for it in the hopes it would bring me fertility and the favor of a man.</p>
-->
<p class="regtxt5">My life had already been complicated, but it became much worse whe I reached sixteen floods. I had been getting dreams of fortelling since I had first bled, some involving death, but none had involved my family. This one showed my father and Imhotep dying while at work on nesu's, pharaoh's, tomb. I couldn't stay silent this time, like I had so many times before. I told my father but he didn't believe me. Finally, in desperation, I ran to the compound of Imhotep himself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The house guards stopped me before I could reach the door. "Be gone girl. Do not disturb the rest of the master." I did not turn and go as he commanded but ran at the door, wailing in frustration. He grabbed me before I could reach the wood and held me tightly. "Girl, you are making me angry. Go at once before I have you confined." I beat at his chest and cried, hollered, and screamed until he grew nervous from my display. At last he turned to the other one and said, "Go, get the assistant to the master. He will know what to do with this woman." He shook me roughly. "Foolish girl, you could be beaten for this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It does not matter. I must speak to the great one." A few moments later the door opened once more to reveal the other guard and another man. Immediately I shouted, "Please, I must see the great one. It is a matter of life and death."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shut up fool girl. How dare you speak of life and death? I was going to send you on your way with a warning, but now I will have to have you punished."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Imhotep, master, please, I must speak to you!" I yelled again through the open door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You two, take her to the stable and give her 20 lashes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hold," a quiet strong voice called from inside the shadows. "What is going on here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing great one," the assistant answered quickly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If it is nothing why is this woman screaming into the night and being threatened with whippings?" He looked straight at me and my mouth went dry. "Bring her to my hall and be gentle about it." He turned and strode away. The guards pulled me along behind while the assistant stalked along beside.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the hall I hesitated, confronted by the wealth and power it displayed. The walls were covered in fine white plaster, painted with scenes of Imhotep with nesu on hunts and expeditions. Several lavish chairs were placed near the large chair Imhotep sat in. The assistant began to speak as soon as he was in the room, "Master, you should not concern..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Be quiet. I have told you before not to be so heavy handed in the treatment you give to others. I will speak with you later." He motioned to the guards. Instantly they released me. "Come now girl. Come sit near me and tell me why you have raised this disturbance in my house."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly I stepped forward and settled onto my haunches, head bowed in reverence. He reached a weathered hand out and tilted my chin up. "Get up and sit in the chair. You are my guest tonight." Numbly I stood and sat on the thick cushions of the nearest chair. A small sigh of wonder slipped out before I could stop it. It brought a small smile to his face. "Now, perhaps you could explain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I launched into my tale but I must have really garbled it because he reached out, tipped my head up, and said, "Say that again, but slower this time, please."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please, great one, do not go to the tomb tomorrow. The stone will fall and you will be crushed and my father with you. I dreamed of it and every dream I have had like this has come true. Please, stay away from the tomb."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And who is your father?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sekhret, chief stone worker."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So you are Mereret, the daughter of Sekhret. They call you the strange one in the streets do they not?" I dropped my head in shame, cheeks burning under his gaze. He lifted my head up again, "Do not be ashamed. I was a strange one in my youth as well and look where I am now. You say these dreams show you actual events every time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes great one, every time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Do you truly believe what you have said?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes great one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you haven't tried to alter the course of events before? Don't you think that was rather unfeeling of you?" I tried to lower my head again but he held it up. "No, do not bow your head. You bear a great gift and a great curse if this is true. You may not have come from high blood, but neither did I. You need show no shame or deference to me. And please, at least for tonight, stop calling me great one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...that is...no gr...master, I did not try to alter the events in the past. I would not have now, for who am I to meddle in the affairs of fate, yet I could not sit by while my father and you died. I will risk the wrath of the gods before allowing that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Spoken like a true daughter of Kmt," he looked around the room and fixed his household with a stern eye. "This young woman has more courage than those of you here. She is a commoner, who stands to lose much if I were to decide against her, yet she came to plead her cause. We should all learn from this. Daughter, I will heed your words. Your father and I shall declare tomorrow a day of work away from the tomb itself. Did you see anything else which might..." Dizziness surged through me as he spoke. Images shifted and repainted in my vision. I saw the tomb face slide and collapse, burying the main entry, but this time no one was harmed. "Daughter?" Imhotep called softly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It changed," I replied in a voice of wonder. "It changed! The face of the tomb will slide down upon itself, yet none shall be harmed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is something I would ask of you. In the future, come to me with these visions. It would be best if we can change them from scenes of death."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will gr...master, I will, and thank you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Go home and sleep. Tell your father to come here at first light. I would speak with him before the day begins."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes master."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stumbled out of the house and slowly walked home. Inside I delivered the message to my father and started toward bed. "Why did you speak to Master Imhotep?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I dreamed...I dreamed of his death and your death."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that what you have been hiding, Mereret?" my mother asked. "Are you dreaming of things that happen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes mother." I twisted nervously in place.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And how many of these have you had?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I lost count, mother. They started when I began to bleed. Now they are strongest at that time and at the time of the flooding."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why did you say nothing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is not my place to interfere in the actions of Fate. And I was afraid. Afraid they would not always be true and then I would cause great harm and misery by speaking out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My foolish daughter. Did you not think that it was Fate that gave this to you? That maybe it was Fate telling you to give these people a chance?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stopped fidgeting and stood frozen as icy terror wrapped itself around me. "No, oh no, please no..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mereret, my poor daughter." My mother pulled me into a close hug and stroked my head. "Shh, it will be ok. I did not mean to scare you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I never thought about them in that way. Oh gods, what if I doomed those people? I do not want this!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are given gifts sometimes. None can say what the gods intend. My mother had these dreams as well. You can get through this. You will see, it will be all right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Master Imhotep asked me a similar thing. How could I be so foolish? He made me promise to tell him of the dreams. Since he commanded it I guess I must obey. Maybe then I can atone..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course you must obey!" my father said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am sorry father. I hope I have not caused you trouble with Master Imhotep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you had he would have told you. Master Imhotep is quite direct that way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come daughter, I will make for you what I made for my mother when she feared these things. Sekhret, you should sleep. Imhotep wants you early in the day." She guided me to the small room where I slept. "I will be right back." She returned moments later with a small box. From it she pulled various bags of powders. She mixed pinches from each of them into a small mug of beer. After several minutes wait she handed it to me. "Drink it all and drink it fast because it tastes terrible. It will help though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tipped the mug up and tried to drink it fast. It was terrible and I almost choked trying to get it down. It took effect quickly though. Soon she was laying me down and pulling the blanket over me. Dreamless sleep claimed me immediately.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Daylight streamed into my room when I awoke. I stood and then fell back onto the bed as the room spun. My mother came running when she heard my gasp. "I should have told you. You need to move slowly after waking. That stuff leaves you wobbly for most of the next day. You just sit and I will get you some food. Sometimes it helps." The food helped with the desire to fall over when standing but I was still vacant and distracted. I spent the rest of the day following my mother around and helping with only the simplest tasks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The confusion and dizziness had faded enough that I was able to help with the evening meal like I normally did. My father arrived after my younger brothers. He had a strange look on his face as he sat and took his food from me. Once we had all finished and cleared away the remains of the meal he said, "I had an interesting conversation with Master Imhotep this morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When he didn't continue, I finally asked, "Am I in trouble?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, Mereret. But you did make an impression on him last night with your determination. He wants me to apprentice you to him as scribe and assistant." I sat down hard. "Normally I will not commit my children to something without their agreement, however, this I can not refuse."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...I would be honored. I never expected...I never intended...oh."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So my strange sister gets noticed. I have been studying as a scribe for years now and she gets this kind of honor?" My brother Sethi complained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Be quiet Sethi. This is an honor for our entire family. It will most likely get you noticed more quickly as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When does Master Imhotep want me to start?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tomorrow morning you are to go to his house at sunrise. He did not say if you would live with him or if you would continue to live here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey strange, can I have your room?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure Sethi, if I have to go." I said not really listening to him. My head was full of apprehension and wonder. I feared I was not equal to what Imhotep expected. I had no training in anything other than managing a home and family.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should not call your sister that." My father told him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone calls her that. She is strange."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Still, you should set a better example. You know her, they do not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, I know her and she is stranger than they think. She stares off into the distance half the time and can not concentrate the other half."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is enough!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes father."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mereret, I want you to wear your festival gown tomorrow. I will make sure you are on your way in time." There was more conversation but I remember none of it. My head was full of random thoughts and fears.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Morning came too quickly and my father's voice called me from sleep. After a small meal of left over bread we were on our way. The guards opened the gates of Imhotep's compound without a word.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mereret, Sekhret, welcome to the new day and welcome to my home." Imhotep stood in his garden in a simple kilt watching the sun rise. "Sekhret, I thank you for the gift of your daughter as my assistant and scribe. Mereret, welcome to my home. I would like it very much if you could live here while you are under my training."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Master, it will be an honor to serve you." I bowed low and wondered what was to come next.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sekhret, please proceed to the work site and get everyone started. I will be along shortly. I need to get my assistant settled into her new work." My father bowed and left after a last long look my way. "Now, let me get you started. You will follow me everywhere and observe everything that I do and say. You will spend your days with me and in the evenings we will start your scribe training. I have informed my household that they are to obey you as they would me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next four years passed in a blur of learning and activity. Imhotep was highly placed in the ranks of nesu's servants so many tasks fell to him. I was there for all of them from the taxes and census duties to the creation of the step pyramid for the nesu's tomb. The visions kept coming and we used them to save as many lives as possible.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">During the years I took several lovers, trying to find a husband and start a family. By the time I was twenty I was realizing I was barren. My relationships weren't going very well either. Of the men that I wanted most were intimidated by my position and disappointed by my inability to bear children. The men that wanted me desired the status of my position more than they desired me. I worked hard to stay connected to the families of my brothers. Through them I shared in the joys of children.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My father died during my twentieth year. He caught a wasting disease and was gone within a lunar cycle. Imhotep adopted me soon after and contracted to give me one third of his estate on his death. He had fathered five children but only one son had lived to adulthood. I was a replacement daughter for the one that had died a year before I had barged into his home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I passed the inheritance from my father to my youngest brother. He had just married and had a baby girl to care for. They needed the little bit I had more than I did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Things changed again in my twenty second year. It was an unseasonably hot and humid day after the floods. I couldn't sleep so I had left my sleeping chamber and climbed onto the roof of the house. A slight breeze brought just a hint of cool to my flushed skin. I was facing into the breeze when a flash of light erupted in the distance. It was as intense as the sun in a mirror and lasted about as long. Confused images streamed over my vision for a moment. It was like a shifting vision only more chaotic and disconnected. Dizziness forced me to the rooftop. For long moments I struggled not to vomit dinner. Once that passed I lay on the rooftop gulping air and trying to stop the spinning of the sky above me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the stars stopped their cartwheeling I crawled back down to my room. My hands shook as I tried to get the packets of powder out of the box my mother had given me so long ago. It was a struggle to get each pinch into the stale beer left in a mug by my bed. At last I choked down the draught and doubled over. Desperately I fought not to throw up before the drug could begin its work.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next thing I knew Imhotep was asking. "Another bad vision?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I opened my eyes to see packets scattered on the floor around me. I was curled around the empty mug and cramped from spending the night on the floor. Imhotep squatted next to me. "Master, it didn't make sense. None of it. I saw people, afraid of the light, stalking the night, blackness, searing light and things I do not understand enough to even describe. It was like a vision only this time it made no sense at all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought I heard you moving around last night. Did you happen to see the light flash?" He continued from my startled look. "You were not the only one. Many people saw it and are afraid."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you have any idea what it might mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No my daughter. I have no ideas. Truthfully, I was hoping you might have." He helped me to stand. "Isesa has some food for you. Let me help you." He guided my unsteady footsteps to the main hall, sat me down in his chair, and served me the food himself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Master..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just indulge me. Besides, I need you to be as close to normal as possible when we go to look where the light was seen. I want to take a look around. Maybe there will be something that will help us understand. Most viewers say it was on or near the Giza plateau."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once I was able to stand without his help we set out. It was a long trek to the plateau. It was late afternoon when we climbed the last bit and emerged on the plateau itself. Images flashed across my view and words tumbled forth without conscious thought. "Imhotep, the name shall be like unto the gods. Long will you live in the memories of the world. Great shall be your name, as great as that of Nesu Netjerikhet Djoser. Monuments and temples, fantastic sculptures and tombs shall cover this land. Great will be the name of this land in the minds of the descendants. But they will lose understanding of us. Mysteries will we be."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Daughter?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did I say?" I tried to focus on Imhotep but his face kept blurring and shifting. One moment I saw my friend and master, the next he was a face frozen in stone. "Not again. Can not stay..." Hot light flashed in my mind, searing and brilliant. dropping me to the sand with a howl of pain. "Light door lets evil walk. It is ripped now. The air will never heal. The light door will always be waiting. Waiting in the greatest pyramid. Waiting for the..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mereret?!?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly his face swam into view and stayed there. I tried to stand but couldn't. Once more my master helped me up. "The light let something evil into the land. I do not have any words for the pictures. I am sorry master."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come my daughter, we should be headed home. It is late in the day and wild things still prowl the plateau."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next day the first of many deaths occurred. Menekhet was found at the edge of his fields. My master was summoned because of the strange manner of the death. At first it looked like a wild beast had savaged his throat, however when we looked closer there were no claw marks. There was only a ragged tear in his throat and there was almost no blood. The last time an animal had killed like this there had been blood everywhere near the body.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next morning Neferet was found dead in the same way in her home. Her two youngest children were found still in their rooms. All of them had their throats torn and there was no blood. Her husband and oldest son were missing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We had a quiet day and then there were three deaths and four more missing. Two days later there were six deaths and eight missing. The city watch was doubled and people were told to stay inside after dark. The last didn't seem like much advice, it hadn't saved anyone yet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the morning we found two of the guards near their post. They had been twisted and snapped around like a mouse after a cat had finished with it. They also showed the throat marks. Nine others were dead as well and five more were missing. A flash of color caught my eye as the guards moved one of their dead comrades. In the dust underneath him was a small turquoise tet amulet. The binding cord had snapped during a struggle. "You, hold please." The guards fixed me with a stern glare.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hold," Imhotep echoed. The guards instantly stopped and turned their eyes to him. "What is it Mereret?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would like to see if the dead man is missing an amulet. Set him back down for a moment, if you would?" Once the body was on the ground a quick look revealed a tet amulet of his own as well as a scarab beetle. I was about to step away when discolorations near the neck wound caught my attention. "Master, could you watch my teeth?" I pulled his head and shoulders up and made as if to bite his neck.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several in the crowd hissed in surprise and disapproval. Imhotep looked at me and nodded. Carefully I eased him back down and stepped away. I nodded back to Imhotep and he said, "You may take him now." Once the soldiers had started off he motioned me away as well. "Not a perfect fit of course, but it looks like someone bit him. Very nice find my daughter."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There were strange discolorations near the wound. Something did not seem right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A demon then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A quick flash flew past my eyes. A woman in strange dress stepped through a portal of light. "The one from the light. It looks like a very light skinned woman wearing some type of loose leg coverings and a chest covering." The image faded rapidly as we walked away from the crowd. "Master, do you hear the mutterings? Perhaps I should not have done that last thing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe not, but we know more now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something about the scene near the bodies continued to bother me for the rest of the day. During breaks in my tasks I pulled the thought out and worried at it. It wasn't until I was almost asleep when it came to me. I had seen Netjeret in the crowd but she had been one of the early victims. I saw the events play out then. Netjeret had stepped out of her house and a dark shape grabbed her from the shadows. It tore her throat and sucked down her blood, then dropped her and faded back into the shadows. A second vision followed the first in which I saw the shadow figure step into the moonlight. An older pale woman stared into the distance as her face and body changed to that of Netjeret.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I leapt up and went searching for Imhotep. The house steward mentioned he had gone out on an urgent errand. Without thinking I stepped out into the night. Swiftly I walked toward Netjeret's house. I had no idea what I was going to do once I got there, I just needed to take a look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A shadowy shape detached from the deeper shadows near the house and darted toward me. It was impossibly fast. It grabbed me and slapped a hand over my mouth before I could draw breath to scream. "My, my, you are the clever one, but not clever enough. I saw you watching me today at the gate. I am going to give you the chance to be clever for me now. First I will show you how the others died, then I will give you a gift. One you can pass on to your friend, the old man."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I struggled fiercely as her teeth ripped into my throat. Cold seeped into me as warmth pulsed out my neck. My vision dimmed to black as I heard her from a distance, "Now for your gift." She crushed something against my mouth and held it there. My lip split under the force as blood flowed into my mouth. I wanted to gag and choke but I couldn't. "Swallow you stupid cow," she hissed in my ear. A warm tingling began at the split in my lip. Rapidly it swelled to fill my face, then my head. With it came orgasmic pain and shrieking pleasure. I convulsed and felt the blood flow down my throat. "I give you immortality and the hunger." She laughed softly as she dropped me to the ground. "Just be inside before sunrise. Happy feeding." The pleasure and pain built to a screaming peak and I slipped into darkness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I awoke near dawn with a screaming hunger. For long moments I couldn't remember where I was or why I was there. Memories returned in a rush and my hand flew to my neck. The horrible wound was gone. For a moment I thought it might all have been a vision, until I realized I was laying in the street.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A faint breeze brought the smell of old copper. My hunger pulled me to my feet. I was running toward the smell before my mind could catch up. I dashed into the yard of the slaughter house. I grabbed a drain pot and tipped it up. There was nothing in it. I darted around the place looking everywhere for blood. Frustrated growling sounds were coming from me when I found a last pot near the back table. I tipped it up and drank deeply of the stale blood. It filled me but did little for the hunger. Within minutes I had emptied the pot. I felt full and bloated yet I still craved more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was about to search again when I sensed it. Near the doorway was the blood I wanted. It sparkled and sang to me. "Hello, Who is in there?" The voice came from the blood. I coiled for a spring, then tried to stop myself at the last minute. I knew that voice, it was Rahotep, master butcher and friend. I landed in a pile of pots with a loud crash. "You there, what are you doing in here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A second figure moved in the doorway. Early sunlight flashed in my eyes. It burned like fire and I screamed as I scrambled deeper into the shadows. "Mereret? Hey it is Mereret, the scribe of Imhotep. Mereret, what are you doing here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The hunger pulled at me. I could taste their blood flowing over my tongue. It took most of my concentration to stay where I was. "Sick, very sick. Get Imhotep," I managed to gasp out. Then I went back to struggling not to move. Rahotep moved to come closer. "Stay back!" I screamed. He hesitated for a minute. "Stay back my friend. Sick, so very sick." Rahotep waited at the door while Khasekhem, the other man, ran off into the morning light.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mereret?" Imhotep called from the door. He stepped into the room and started toward me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Master, stop! Stay away from me. I can barely hold myself back with you at the door." So much blood, bright and sweet, calling to me. "Ahhhh," I moaned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is wrong?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The demon bit me. It has taken the missing ones." Another moan slipped out. "The hunger, so powerful. I want your blood so badly. It and the ones it has taken want blood. Oh gods!" The hunger struggled to throw me at them. So sweet, they smelled so very sweet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What can I do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kill me. I do not know how long I can hold back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I will not do that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then tie me up, anything. Just keep me from hurting anyone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I know you. You are my daughter and you will not hurt anyone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A hunger spasm ripped through me. In desperation I grabbed the edge of a pot and clenched down on it. It shattered in my hands. "Need blood...agh..." Pain blossomed behind my eyes as I fought against it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mereret, I can get you blood," Rahotep replied, "but we need to work in the front here to do it. Can you stay there if we work up here in the front?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...maybe...I will try."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need to go see what the nightly death toll is. I will be back later to see how you are doing, daughter."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Master, the day hurts them. That is why all the deaths happen at night."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Khasekhem led a goat into the front of the shed. I surged to me feet when I smelled the blood as it splashed into a pot. My moans caused them to shiver in fear. The smell of it coiled around the blood and drove me into a frenzy. I surged forward, stopping just feet from them. Khasekhem dropped the pot. In a display of speed I caught it before it hit the ground. For a moment I could almost believe I was feasting on my friends as the fear smell mixed with the blood sliding over my tongue.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All too soon the pot was empty. "More," I moaned pitifully. They looked at each other then Khasekhem brought in another goat. The rest of the day passed with me guzzling down numerous pots full of blood. The bloated fullness made the hunger endurable even with the sparkling call of human blood nearby.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By late afternoon I was nodding off from stuffing with blood and exhaustion from struggle. The demon blossomed in a vision as my eyes slid shut. I could hear her muttering to herself as she stalked through the empty streets, "So clever. Well let us see how clever you are when I kill that meddling old man. Let me see if you can still fight the hunger then." She walked up to the gate and killed our guards first. She didn't even stop to drink. Inside she went directly toward Imhotep's room. It chilled me to know that somehow she already knew her way around our house. Old Isesa, the cook, tried to stop her. She fed on her and dropped her body carelessly when done. In my master's room she stopped long enough to taunt him before beginning her work. She grabbed and held him as effortlessly as she had me. First she broke his arms, then his shins, and finally she sunk her teeth into him. She ripped her arm open and stared at it. "Shall I take you for my own? You could be so very useful... What would make that bitch daughter of yours suffer more I wonder?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I struggled up and ran. Khasekhem and Rahotep dove out of the way as I ran straight for them. Outside the setting sun poured salt in my eyes and traced screaming fire over my skin. Still I ran, ignoring the horrified stares of those that saw the dried blood caked on my clothes. Terror pushed me to run faster. I was almost home when the sun finally set. The relief was instantaneous.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Up ahead I saw a dark figure slipping toward the gate and the two guards. "No! You can not have them!" I screamed as I ran faster. The demon's laughter floated to me as it turned to watch my approach.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fool, you can not kill me. I made you." It turned its back on me and stepped toward the first guard. I slowed as numbness spread through me. My legs refused to carry me forward. Desperately I leaned toward them and stumbled, catching myself as my foot moved at last. In this half stumble walk I moved slowly closer. The demon sank her fangs into the guard and the call of the blood surged through me. I tried to move faster.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The vision crashed before my eyes. The horror of it burned through me, driving back the numbness in my limbs. With a scream I flung myself at the demon. I hit it low and slammed it into the gate. It spun and smashed a fist into my face. "Bitch! You can not win." I staggered back as it launched itself at me. It was insanely fast, landing blow after blow while I tried to dodge and swing back at it. Pain exploded in my chest from one of the blows. I doubled over and that saved me from the swing heading for my face. Another blow slammed up into my chest and I heard something break. Blood filled my mouth when I tried to breath out. Blackness danced around the edges of my vision and I dropped to my knees. The demon laughed as it started to turn away from me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In desperate terror I shoved upward with my hand, punched through the skin of the demon's stomach and up inside it. It went crazy, screaming and thrashing frantically. In a reflexive move I grabbed something as it shoved me back. I landed hard on my back several feet away. Clutched in my hand was its heart. It toppled forward and lay still. Within moments the body dissolved into a small pile of dust. The heart in my hand crumbled seconds later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Through fading vision I saw Imhotep run out the gate with several of our guards on his heals. "Mereret? What happened here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Blood bubbled out of my mouth with the words. "Vision. Demon coming for you. Couldn't let it..." His faced faded into blackness.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">When I awoke I was in my room, on my bed, with a blanket thrown over me. A pot of slightly old blood sat on the floor near my head and Imhotep sat in a chair at the door. "Amazing. I feared the injuries you had were going to kill you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I grabbed the blood pot and drink it down before speaking, "You should still kill me father."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You never call me that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have thought of you that way for several years now. You have done so much for me and I am afraid I will only repay you with death. I am afraid of myself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The demon did not let you go once you killed it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. It is more like a demon of sickness rather than a possession of spirit. The hunger for blood is still with me. I am not sure I am your daughter any more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe you are not at that. My daughter loves life, her friends, learning new things, and she does not back down from a challenge. There is darkness in all of us. The trick is to make peace with it while remaining human."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Father, I..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mereret, if you ask me to kill you again, I will. I will know you are no longer my daughter."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was going to ask if there is any more blood. I am ravenous again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He stepped out of my room and returned with another full pot. My hands twitched as I took it from him. It was so hard not to grab my master and sink my teeth into the brightness of him instead of the cold nasty mass in the pot. "I am afraid there is only one more after this. Then I will have to get more in the morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It slid down without calming the hunger, but it did fill the ache in my belly. "I do not want to be like this. What do I do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I do not know," he paused for a long time. "I found something in the dust of the demon. Maybe it will tell us something about it." He stared at me for a long time then continued, "I will get it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He returned with an ornate necklace held in one hand. I stared and thought back. The demon hadn't been wearing a necklace when it attacked me. "Take a look. Your eyes are better than mine, you might see something I did not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was cool and soft in my hand, not at all like silver and gems. Just holding it calmed me. I stared at it. A central ruby red gem shimmered and called to me. Around it emeralds, rubies, turquoise, and amethysts winked and sparkled. It looked old. Several gems had fallen out leaving empty sockets in the pattern. It shifted in my vision and the pattern snapped into clarity. The empty sockets were deliberate, part of the workings of the piece. It shimmered and wavered before my eyes and then began to shrink. Cool calming peace spread up my arm and the hunger began to fade.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Imhotep gasped and pointed. I tried to speak but found I was frozen in place as the necklace seeped into my hand. When the last little silver bit faded into my skin energy erupted through me. Images cascaded through my inner sight. Fast and confusing images of strange buildings, gangly creatures with three fingered hands, a violet sky, doors of swirling light and a rain of poison dust. The white skinned demon walked across a dead landscape of shattered buildings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Understanding of a sort poured into the parched ground that was me. It filled me up and overflowed leaving confusion and strangeness. I saw stars from eyes that looked through clear shininess into black emptiness. A glowing ball turned into blue, brown, and green, and then into land and houses. Torn air made way for me to step between places. Faster and faster it swirled like water into a hole.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The flood pulled my mouth open in a silent scream. Imhotep, heedless of his own safety, closed the distance between us and held me close. His touch was instant comfort and distant impressions. The flood filled me and erupted from the top of my head. At last my awareness gave up and I slipped into comforting darkness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I awoke to arms holding me. For a moment I thought I was young again and my mom was holding me after a nightmare. The strange new awareness woke next, immediately dispelling that pleasant thought. "I have you daughter. Are you all right?" Imhotep's voice spoke softly near my ear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Head feels overstuffed, ready to pop. No danger to you now, the hunger sleeps." He relaxed as the words settled in. For a moment I closed my eyes and relaxed as well. For the first time since the demon bite I felt at peace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly the room spun as images bubbled up, shifted and aligned again. They poured out my mouth without stopping in my thoughts, "The night walkers, wood is their poison, blood is their feast. Wood to the heart will end the gorging. Blood to blood will spread the desire. Always the key will sample the takings." The images shifted restlessly before settling back into the dark depths. "No control, too much. Please, just hold me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here," Imhotep picked up a cup from near the bed. "I had your mother show Isesa and I how to prepare this last time she was here." I gulped down the cure and waited. Sleep came quickly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When I next awoke daylight bathed the hall outside my room in warm light. Imhotep was still propped against the wall holding me even as he slept. He stirred when I moved. "How are you now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I still feel stuffed full of strange pictures, but better I think. Thank you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Imhotep smiled, then grimaced as he tried to move. "Not as young as I used to be. Dare I ask if you are hungry?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am, but not like I was yesterday." I stood and sat back down. "Damn, I hate this part. Is there any more blood?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I will need to get some more. Would you like to try something else?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could try food I guess..," Imhotep stood and walked toward the kitchen. He was back in a few minutes with bread, dates, and hard cheese. It helped, but the blood hunger was not stilled by the regular foods.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ready to face the day?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stood slowly, waiting to see if the dizziness would return. When it did not I started toward the door. The sunlight splashed on the wall slowed me down. I remembered the intense pain of yesterday and came to a stop. "The light burns me. Is there something I can do inside today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could use an update on the stone requirements for the tomb. Most of the information should be in my work room." Imhotep replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, master. I will finish those for you." I followed him as far as his work room, hugging the shadows and darting across the shaft of light in the hall. The complicated calculations for the stone requirements usually were the hardest thing I had to do. This time I looked at them and they seemed too simple. The reed seemed to dip itself into the ink as I rearranged the formulas until they looked right. Then I began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When I finished I showed we needed fewer blocks because of the shape of the structure. It didn't seem possible so I used the older formulas and came up with the larger numbers we had been using. Then I compared the calculated numbers from the finished sections with the actual tallies from the project. There were stones left over. Intrigued now I used the modified formulas to calculate the needed stone for the finished sections. The calculations matched the actual stone counts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Imhotep returned as I was finishing my last checks. He stared at the papyrus full of numbers and formula, then stared at me before asking, "What are you doing? Those are not the formulas."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They just look better." Rapidly I explained what the different results were. Soon he was as curious as I had been. We ran through as many samples as we had information for. In all cases my formulas were more accurate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did these come from your images?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think so. I was staring at the papyrus and they just did not look right until I changed them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What else can you get from them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Gingerly I opened up to the images. It was like letting water into a canal. If I eased into it I found I could look without being overwhelmed. Images swirled in and out, things I had never seen yet were as familiar as the way to the houses of my brothers. An image of the necklace swam to the surface. The center gem glowed brilliant red and a face floated in one of the emeralds in the second ring out from the center gem. The face looked familiar. As I concentrated on it the gem swelled in size, becoming a green pool, inviting me to dive in. Warm green light flowed around me as I dove. Green tingles caressed my flesh as I dove deeper. The face resolved into Netjeret as I floated through it. Memories crashed into me. I was Netjeret on her last day. She/I staggered home after a grueling day helping her husband with the fish.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everything was tinged in a faint greenish halo. I felt two different feelings, awe of Imhotep from Netjeret and my usual love and affection. I could choose from her feelings or mine, her actions or mine, like a puppeteer and his puppet. Her thoughts were mine and I could see her memories of me, from the time I was little until the time of her death.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A startled gasp pulled my eyes open. Everything was tinged with a faint green light, even Imhotep where he stared at me from the far wall. With a trembling hand he pointed at me as he asked, "What are you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Master?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stay here." He ran out the door. The faint smell of fear wafted from where he had stood. I was about to follow him when he eased himself back into the room. Staying as far from me as he could he set something on the work table. "Look at yourself," he commanded as he backed away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly I stepped to the table. I picked up the mirror he had brought and looked into it. Netjeret looked back at me. The mirror fell from numb fingers as I sagged back against the work table. I thrashed and struggled in the green pool until I broke through the surface. A clean white tingle flowed around me and Imhotep asked again, "What are you?" Netjeret's memories ran out of my mind like water from a cup.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slid down to the floor and looked in the mirror. My face stared back at me. "I no longer know, master." I stared into my own eyes for a very long time. At last I pulled them away and looked over to him. "You asked what else the images could do," I said softly. I looked into the green gem, this time standing at the edge of the pool. Memories slowly filtered in. "I know what happened to Netjeret. I saw it through her eyes. I know how the demon came and went. It would take the face of one of us, just like I did." I gestured to where the necklace should have been, at the tattoo that it was. "This let the demon change. There is so much more but I do not understand yet. Master, please believe I am still Mereret, still your assistant."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am not sure..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please! Give me a little time to figure some of this out. If I hurt anyone you can kill me. A piece of wood through the heart and it will be done. Until then, please, let me try."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Imhotep started to speak when the vision crashed into me. "No, not now..." I whimpered. Night walkers stalked through my oldest brother's house. They feasted on everyone there and settled in for the next day. When the wife of my youngest brother arrived in the morning they started in on her. "My family, my mother and oldest brother. The blood eaters come for them tonight. Must save them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ideas chased around and were discarded. Guards at the door, no, too obvious. Guards in the rooms, maybe but too enclosed. Bring them here, that would work but wouldn't reduce the ranks of the blood eaters. Imhotep watched as I paced the room. "Back track them. Maybe I can stop them before they get to the house." Back at the work table I scratched plans of the streets near my brother's place. The vision shifted. This plan had a chance. "Master, " I tried to tell him what we needed to do but the images poured through so fast I couldn't get the words to keep up. In desperation I sketched rapidly on the papyrus. Swift pen strokes and placements while I fought with the words. "Wood spears to end the fears. Dreams of shattered time to still. Hunger draws the not dead to madness. Lost life and dreams to die tonight." The words wouldn't stay in order. The vision was so clear and the words so muddled. This was the first time it had been this way. It became the standard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I beat at my head in frustration until Imhotep grabbed my hands. "Stop that! What are you doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The images, too fast. No time for the words. Got to get the words."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shh, shh, be gentle with yourself. It will happen or we will find a way around it. The drawing is where you need us to be? Then that is where we will be." He strode to the door calling the house guards as he went. We headed out into the late afternoon. I stopped at the edge of the shadow and remembered the pain of the light. I sucked in a deep breath and stepped out into it, expecting fire. There was nothing. My breath came out in a whooshing gasp. A few more steps took me into the direct sunlight and still there was no pain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty minutes later we were all in place. Four guards were stationed in the alleys around the block where my brother lived. Imhotep as hidden in the front door with another guard at his side. I was on the roof of the house, hidden behind a small chest. The sun sank slowly toward the horizon. A faint breeze sprang up through the street bringing the scent of cooking fires and food with it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the sun set and shadows flowed through the streets one of the guards shifted. It was such a little thing, the moving from one foot to the other, but the vision shifted again. A rock rolled and tapped another one. The sound was so tiny yet a darker shadow moving up the street heard it, hesitated, then motioned to the forms moving behind it. Two forms broke off and flowed toward a second alley. They would slip down it, take the guard from behind, then go after Imhotep and the guard at the door. The others would pull the remaining guards.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Running would not get me to them in time. I did the most unlikely thing then, I dove from the roof. Skills I never possessed drew me into a strange roll. I ended upright facing the shadows as they emerged behind the guard. For a second the forms hesitated. Until now they had been blood eaters. Now I saw there faces and recognized one of them. "Kahtenet, how?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mereret, help me!" Kahtenet called as his companion swung at me. Hot tingles swept through me and I dodged the clumsy blow like it was the slow motion of a young child. "So hungry," Kahtenet moaned. He turned toward the guard. My hand swung in a blur, driving the short stake of wood through his back and into his heart. A small sigh escaped as he collapsed to his knees, then fell face forward into the dust.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The second one yelled as he swung. A swift kick slammed him into the wall. Behind me I heard a shout, "Kill them all!" I half turned to see who had yelled when a fist smashed into my face. Blood flowed into my left eye as I spun back. This one was faster than Kahtenet. My stab went wild and skidded off his arm. He shrieked in pain and kicked out at me. I narrowly dodged and drove the stake into his heart.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The guard at the door cried out. I saw him go down under a shadowy body. A second went for Imhotep. I ran for them and made it to the center of the street when a rock bounced off my head. My vision blurred and swam as I dropped to my knees. Shaking my head I crawled toward the door. I grabbed the first set of ankles I saw and pulled. A spitting struggling blood eater dropped in front of me. Imhotep stabbed down with his spear but couldn't quite hit my opponent. At last, in desperation, I jabbed my hand into its belly and reached up. Blood covered me as it thrashed around until I could rip its heart loose.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The hunger scrambled forward at the call of the blood scent. To my horror I shoved my face into the welling blood and downed a huge mouthful. The face of the blood eater swam before my eyes and Imhotep's voice receded into the background. I saw how he was changed, and I saw the blood eater that had done it. It wasn't the demon as I had expected, but one of the others.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I pushed and shoved at the images until they receded enough that I could see reality instead of the past. I staggered upright to prepare for another foe. Another rock smashed into the side of my head and I landed face first in front of the door. Frantically I struggled to roll and rise again. In the distance a voice shouted, "Run. They are too dangerous for food."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is a very disturbing thing you just did Mereret." Imhotep said through a strained, white face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What was?" My brother asked from behind him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Imhotep spun to see my brother in the now open door. "Um, nothing Sehkenet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What happened out here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sehkenet, I think you should go back inside. The death that is plaguing the city just tried for your door. Let us clean up before your family sees this mess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My brother took in the blood caking my clothes, the dead guard and blood eater at Imhotep's feet, and the scene across the street before he replied, "Yes Master Imhotep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Master, I should leave." I said as I turned to go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Back at home I went to the work room after removing my blood soaked things and cleaning up. I was going to write out as much about the strange images as I could. I started with Netjeret and everything I knew about her. From there I moved to the blood eater I had killed at my brother's door. I hadn't known anything about him until sampling his blood. Now I saw one of the other blood eaters change him. I saw everything about his life before the changing and after.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Somehow I knew I could store this new information in one of the gems of the necklace. This started me looking deeper and drew me to the red pool that was the central gem. Once I dove in I was lost.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Swirling reddish light and shadow surrounded me. Ahead of me, in the distance, was a thin black line that parted slowly as I approached it. I stepped through and emerged through a tear in the air. Impossible buildings stretched out in front of me. A dim violet sky arched above me. A reddish ball of light painted blood shadows on the sand and rock.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The buildings leaned and crumbled. Rubble choked the street ahead of me. The air was thin and cold causing me to shiver in the pants and shirt I was wearing. I was wearing the strange garb of the demon. The demon whose name had been Arascheya Iskandera, and who had thought of herself as a woman, not a demon. She had come to this place for knowledge. She/I stepped forward slowly. Behind me four others emerged from the tear. With a faint pop it snapped shut behind the last one. It had closed but it was not healed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is this it?" One of the others asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I believe so." My voice replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We began walking toward the tallest buildings in the distance. No sound other than a shifting, piping wind broke the brooding silence. No birds called, no insects scuttled or clicked. Under our feet a fine grey dust puffed up at every step. No plants grew in the open doorways or the deserted streets.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One of the others shouted, creating an echo. I spun and fixed him with a deadly glare. It felt like sacrilege to disturb the silence of this long dead place. Terror flitted across his face as he shut up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The city was arranged in giant circles. Once in a while we would have to move sideways to find a street that was not blocked by partially collapsed buildings. The deeper into the city we went the taller the buildings grew. After several hours we were walking beside buildings that blocked the red ball from view. Deep shadows filled the street. Deeper shadows pooled near the buildings and down narrow alleyways.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I turned down another street. Nothing looked different from the last one, however, I knew that my goal was ahead. One building stood out a bit from the others. A faintly glowing rune promised knowledge and power. I gave no indication of this to my companions as we continued our steady walk down the street.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A name drifted on the wind. At first it was so soft it could have been just a slight variation in direction. Slowly it grew in strength until the name "Mereret" could be heard. Something about that name caught my attention. For a second the city in front of me wavered. A glimpse of a lamp lit room flickered into view. Then the city solidified. Again the name drifted on the wind. A face stared at me from the deeper shadows. Once more the name drifted to me. It called with an alluring song. The lamp lit room swam into focus as the dead city melted into deepening shadows. The face from the shadows hovered in front of me. It slipped in and out of focus as I tried to identify it. "Mereret," it called.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where am I?" my voice came out dry and dusty, like the wind of the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Our work room. Where did you go?" I should know that voice, I thought.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?" my voice gained a bit of strength.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I came back and found you here staring into the distance. I have been calling you for a very long time. Where did you go?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know." It came out slowly and in a distracted tone. My head began to hurt as I tried to force myself to see the person talking to me. "I, who am I?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The face looked scared as it answered, "You are Mereret, my assistant and chief scribe. I am Imhotep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ghostly memories assembled themselves. The face became clearer as I looked at it. Imhotep, the name gave form to the shifting fog of features. The room became more real then. "Mereret, I could be her. Is she another overlay?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is that word?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A sheet of clear material placed over another to allow both to be seen. A surrogate personality profile, placed over the core profile, used to infiltrate a target location." The words spilled out and I understood them, even though I had never heard them before.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mereret, what does all that mean?" That name again. It echoed strangely through my cold detachment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Masks, I wear masks of people. But who am I under the masks?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are Mereret. Did the demon take you? Do I need to kill you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I could feel my lips pull back into a feral grin. "I think you would find that very difficult to do." I tilted my head as I tried to understand, "Why would you want to kill me? Have I harmed you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mereret, daughter, I know you are there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The word daughter echoed deeper than the name word. It colored the edges of my sight with a faint hint of ruby light. The light contracted a tiny bit revealing what looked like the edge of a portal in the far distance. Tendrils of the words slipped around me and pulled me toward the far opening. My eyes unfocused as I was pulled tight against a ruby red barrier. Ripping and clawing at it I tore my way through what felt like heavy, wet cloth. "Mereret, I think I am Mereret."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slumped forward and would have fallen if Imhotep hadn't caught me. "What happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I do not know. I came and found you this way. Where were you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh gods, unstuck, lost, drifting in a river of pictures and places. Beware the ruby pool, the center place, the dreaming place." Everything around me had strange edges, too sharp, too hard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The necklace, it is something...something very old and...magical, I think... It stores memories of those that wear it and of those the owner has eaten from. I saw how Netjeret died and I saw how the one I tasted outside the home of my brother was changed. I wrote it down. And then I looked deeper. I was lost in it until you called me back." I wasn't really sure I was completely back but I didn't dare tell Imhotep that. He was scared enough as it was.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Imhotep turned to the table and looked at the papyrus sheets I had been writing on. "What are these symbols?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I took the sheets from him and looked at them. For a moment the symbols were just random curves and edges, beautiful and sinister in some strange way. I looked again and I recognized them as the words they were. "They must be from the necklace. I just started writing and was frustrated by how slow it was to get the thoughts down. Then it was easier." I read the words back to him, translating where I had to from the words he would not know.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He had grown quite pale by the time I finished. In that moment I knew he would remain a man of his time while I had become something else. His image wavered in front of me, lines formed in his face, his posture changed as I saw him age and die. I closed my eyes and abruptly hugged him close. I could taste his flash of fear as his uncertainty of me rushed forward. I clung to him to keep from drowning in the images I was seeing. I was adrift in places only I could go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I loved him so much for how fast the fear fled, and how he held me as silent tears spilled down my cheeks. "What is it my daughter?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Too much, I see too much. Cannot stare at the box. Edges cut and lid flattens. Scary demon girl dances on the lights of the sky while the lady of metal and lightning moves the hovel. Warrior woman watches all. No tomb for me. My heart shall not be for the afterlife. All shall be dust before I fade." I reached my hand to his face and touched the stone of it. "My father, more father than father, how I love you, how I miss you. You anchored me for a time. Now I am lost in the storm. Lost, waiting for my queen that is king."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come with me," He held me and we walked through shifting and flickering shadows. A ghost face poured sparkles into a sky of dust. My statue father added sprinkles of moonlight. Fire streams scorched the sea of me and blessed velvet choked the flames. "Drink and rest now. I will stay with you."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">I drifted awake slowly. The sent of food drifted past. I rose and fell back immediately as the room spun. "Daughter, let me help you." Imhotep steadied me as I sat up. "How are you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Better, ravenously hungry." Silently he handed me a large container of blood and waited while I drank it down. The spinning slowed with the food. "Thank you, master."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hush daughter. I am master to you no more. You have become...something...I know not what. I should fear you, but I can not bring myself to." I started to protest but he stopped me and continued, "No, call me Imhotep or father, but not master, never master again." I hugged him tightly, not trusting myself to speak.</p>
