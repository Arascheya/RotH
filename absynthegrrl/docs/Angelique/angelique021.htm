<p class="pagecaption">London: 1887: Lucy and Mina</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lucy led the way back to the train. Once we had settled in, Mina began to explain. "Lord Wellingham is fighting a battle on many fronts. One is for better working conditions, another is for worker involvement in decisions, and another is against the appalling treatment of women. The protection lists and details are legal documents and a security detail intended to protect anyone on the list from exploitation under the normal laws. It isn't actually legal, but our barristers are able to mitigate and reduce legal actions. I wouldn't tell your inspector about it unless you know him trustworthy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As to being a daughter of Lord Wellingham, well, we get a very generous stipend, are allowed to make our own decisions, and can enter into legal positions using him as proxy. On paper he appears to be in charge, but he lets us make the decisions for our interests. As a result we are able to function with full legal autonomy in all but name," Lucy added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is very enlightened for..." I was about to say 'for this time', but changed it to, "A man of his station."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lady Wellingham has been most persuasive. He wasn't joking about learning some of this from her. He was already inclinded this way, but having a daughter focused his views," Mina replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It has made him some powerful enemies, though," Lucy added. "We have full time security around the estate, our private rail platforms, and at all ITC holdings. There are safe houses and shelters scattered around where employees can go if they are threatened. We have an army of barristers and a few police officials watching out as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You've changed, Angelique," Mina said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You were modest and quiet the last time you visited, now you are confident and stronger," Lucy answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It must be the shock of what happened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Whatever the reason, I like the new Angelique," Mina commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can see your inspector, as long as you are discrete," Lucy said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?" her comment had taken me entirely by surprise.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Father has very few rules about what we can't do. The main one is, cause no harm. The second is try not to embarass yourself or the family. So, see your insepctor, if you want," Mina answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Besides, he's cute, in an older man kind of way. And you intrigue him. I can see it in the way he looks at you," Lucy added. Angelique would have been mortified by this conversation, but I couldn't figure out how to blush on command.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But what about station? He's only a police inspector," I tried to portray what Angelique was like.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You aren't living with that repressive father of yours anymore. You can join the modern times now," Lucy said.</p>
