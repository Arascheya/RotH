<p class="pagecaption">London: 1887: Uncle Richard</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We were sitting at breakfast, the morning after I had gone to the theatre with Lestrade, when Benson came in. "Lord Wellingham, there is a Richard Marsters here to see you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Take him to the study, I will be there shortly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very good, sir," Benson turned to go when a short, stout, red-faced man burst into the breakfast nook.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There you are, you disgraceful thing! Wellingham, I demand you turn this harlot over to me at once. I will not have this woman of low morals damaging my family name."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are you talking about, sir?" Wellingham asked politely.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you not seen the morning papers? This 'woman', and I use the term loosely, was seen consorting with a police officer last night. It was scandalous! She was on his arm at the theatre and they left at the first intermission. Then they were seen boarding a private train where they remained for hours, before the policeman left."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Angelique?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was talking with the inspector. I found the play not to my liking and he had additional questions for me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will not have my family consorting with a mere policeman!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I could see Lucy's face darkening and Mina biting her tongue, but Lord Wellingham spoke first, "Angelique is under my care. I will not have you speaking to her in this way. She is her own woman and has my blessing to see whomever she desires, in whatever capacity she desires."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are the epitome of what is wrong with our civilization, sir. You would destroy the natural order of things, allowing women and lessers to believe they are the equal of their betters. I will see charges brought against you for your failures to properly uphold the traditions of your station and the moral fibre of this nation. Good day to you!" He stomped out of the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How much trouble can he cause?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Some. There are those in the nobility that desire to see me thwarted in my quest to improve the lot of those considered 'lesser'. I don't expect him to get far, though. He is not clever enough to know how best to attack."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Should I refrain from being seen with Lestrade?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I was serious in what I told him. Whom you see, and in what capacity, is your affair. I would caution against observable public affection, should there be such between you. That could lead to attempts at arrest and prosecution under some very archaic laws."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I shall be careful, should things turn in that direction."</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">That evening I slipped out after everyone was asleep. I made my way quietly across the lands and out onto a road near the walls. Making sure I was unobserved, I shifted into Rebecca Thornton, a persona I used when taking on particularly dangerous tasks. I hailed a cab once I had walked closer to London and gave him the address of Uncle Richard's home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slipped into the home through the servant's entrance and up to Richard's room. Once there, I shifted back into Angelique and called his name. He came awake with a startled, "Wha?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dearest Uncle, I have killed young Abernathy, for attempting to kill me. His body has been disposed of in such a way that it will never be found. If you interfere with me again, or seek to injure, harass, or embarrass Lord Wellingham or his family in any way, the same fate shall befall you. Do I make myself clear?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How, how did you get in here?" I just smiled back at him. "I'll have you..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uncle, no one saw me enter. It will be the same when I come to kill you," I said quietly, without any theatrics in my voice. I watched him steadily until I saw belief appear in his eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His eyes dropped and he said slowly, "I will not interfere."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you. Good night." I slipped back out and made my way back to the Wellingham estates, arriving just before morning.</p>
