<p class="pagecaption">London: 1887: Lestrade</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I stepped off the private train, on its private siding and walked into the station. Mid morning crowds surged and broke around me as I headed for the main entrance and the streets beyond. Many heads had turned and followed me when I came from the private section. By the time I reached the doors, they had found other things to occupy them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was a short walk down the street to the Scotland Yard building. I wasn't sure how I was going to find Lestrade, but he was waiting near the doors. Instead of taking me inside, he motioned down the street. "I'm a bit hungry. Would you mind joining me while I get something to eat?" I didn't think this was standard, but nodded and started to follow. He motioned me up to him and hooked my arm through his. "Come, dear lady. Let me escort you properly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This isn't standard police procedure, is it?" I asked after we had walked a short way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. There are questions I wanted to ask, but I don't want it to be official. Ah, here we are," he said as he stopped in front of a small pub named the Northumberland Arms. "Would you be comfortable entering a pub with me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why wouldn't I be?" I was puzzled until the Angelique memories told me this was another issue of propriety for upper class people. "With a police inspector to protect me? I should be fine." He looked at me a bit funny as he pulled the door open and escorted me in. We settled in at a table toward the back and away from the larger crowds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once we were seated a server came over and asked, "The usual, Inspector?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, Amanda. Thank you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And for you, lady?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Steak and kidney pie, with a good stout."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once the server had left, Lestrade said, "You see, there's something that puzzles me. You are a young lady, from a good family, sitting in a pub full of policemen, yet you are perfectly at ease."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"These are modern times..." I began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They are, however, most everyone is nervous around police and would be doubly so in this pub. How have you developed such a sense of calm? I am also interested in the lack of devastation you show over the death of your family."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stared down at the table, trying to martial my thoughts, "Inspector, my family was difficult. My father saw the children as pawns for use in garnering political and financial favor. My stepmother doted on my stepbrother and ignored my brother and I. I loved my brother dearly and miss him the most. My stepbrother was a young boy who was often puzzled by the way he was treated. He deserves better than he was given. I loved my father, but I didn't like him. I am sad he is gone and relieved as well. My calm developed in the face of my father's schemes. It was simpler than reacting every time he had a new plan."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see," Lestrade said thoughtfully. "I am curious, what did you see last night, in the carriage? That wasn't a normal fainting spell."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Images clicked into place, forming part of a larger mosaic, and showing the need to continue the truth dance of the previous evening. "I don't think this is the place to talk about it." He nodded and we finished our meals in silence. After a few minutes to settle up, in which Lestrade wouldn't let me pay, we walked back out into the watery sunshine of an overcast September day. Once more he took my arm and we walked back toward Scotland Yard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you have a place we could talk, or should we adjourn to my office at the yard?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Wellingham's private train is at the station. The car should be empty for a while yet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lead on then, dear lady." His eyes took in everything as I led the way through the station, to the private siding, and into the opulent car. I motioned to the side board and indicated he should pour a drink. He did after a moment of hesitation. Once we were both seated in the perfectly padded leather arm chairs, he said, "Now, where were we?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My aunt has the Sight. Most of my family doesn't know, there are a lot of strong religious beliefs and she fears their reaction. I wasn't sure I believed her until she gave me the answer to a crime early in my career. It's what started my rise to inspector. What did you just see?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That I could share this secret with you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's it like? Aunt Nell couldn't really describe it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is like thousands of frozen moments rushing past, almost too fast to see. If it's something simple, it's pretty easy to determine what they mean. The more complicated, the more disorienting and unclear it becomes. Sometimes I can't help speaking as I try and make sense of too many things at once."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, so last night at your home, you were seeing as you walked to the cab?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is a lot more that you haven't told me, isn't there?" He smiled his predatory smile at the small shiver I couldn't quite suppress. "You are a consummate actress, but it's the little things that give it away. You have the air of the aristocracy but you don't have their inhibitions or their disdain of the rest of us, unless you are thinking of it. You walk with a different type of poise, you expect respect and to be treated as an equal, which is not common either. So, that raises the question of who you really are, doesn't it? And was Angelique Marsters already dead or did you kill her to become her?" His words hit hard enough that I saw a flicker in the faint pink haze of the overlay. Now I understand how unstable an emergency assimilation overlay is and realize how much effort it takes to maintain it. He wouldn't have been able to shock me into losing it now. "What are you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, I don't, don't know what you mean." I tried for confidence but we both knew I had failed miserably. I stood up and started to the door. He twitched, not quite a flinch, but there was a small whiff of fear in the air near him. I locked the door, then went around the car closing all the drapes, then locked the door to the rest of the car. I stood there for a moment, considering killing him, but I liked him and enough was clear from the visions that it would only make things much worse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly I returned to my chair and lowered myself into it. "Do you consider yourself a sane man, inspector?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a simple enough question."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess I do, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What I am about to show you has only been seen by three other people. It will challenge everything you believe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see," he replied very slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think you do," I said as I swam to the top of the red pool and emerged into myself. I heard a sharp intake of breath, followed by a whooshing rush as it was expelled, almost like a punch to the guts. When I focused on Lestrade he was white as the finest linen and sweat beaded his face. The fear scent was only slightly stronger, not enough to call the hunter with any sense of urgency. "What are you?" it came out strangled but stronger than I expected.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am, I am a thing of legend, a chained horror that should have died before the greatest pharaohs ruled Egypt."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His hands trembled as he reached for his drink, brought it to his mouth, and drained it dry in a single gulp. He stood and grabbed the whiskey decanter from the side board and brought it back. He refilled his glass and took another healthy drink. "What is that around your neck?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The question surprised me. There were so many more obvious ones he could have asked. "It is the chain that binds me, that makes me almost safe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why have you shown me this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The visions and because I have learned the risks of misplaced trust are less than the risks of no trust at all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, Lady..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't. I have given you poison, not wine. Once the veil has been torn from the world, it changes everything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He said it with the certainty of one who already knew. "How?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When I was young, I was often sent to my aunt's for the summers. My home life was unpleasant, in ways that led me to the yard and police work. Nell is eccentric, she keeps the old ways, always telling me gods were in everything. I didn't pay all that much attention until I woke one evening to chanting. She was naked, in her kitchen, with a circle painted on the floor. Inside it something indescribable writhed in smoke and mist. Of course I did the exact wrong thing, I distracted her. The thing started to tear its way out of the circle and I knew what to do to help her. I can't explain how I knew, but I did, and I've seen a few things as an inspector where that strange knowledge has helped me. I dare not speak of it at the yard, lest I be thought mad."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But this is part of what makes up the world. I expect science will catch up one day."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tell me about you, if you please." I shifted back into Angelique's form, opened the drapes, and unlocked the door. Once I had returned to a chair, I told him, in as much detail as he asked for. I showed him how I could assume an overlay, how I could become it, using one of the complete ones instead of the damaged Angelique one. I explained how I had become Angelique, what I knew of the original, how I couldn't save her, and about her family. I explained about the others, the vampyr created by the one that had changed me, and about the ones I had destroyed in Whitechapel. It took a long time but I left nothing out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was about to ask him what would come next when I heard Lucy's voice outside. "The others are back. How do you want to handle this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had more questions and you weren't comfortable in my office."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They burst through the door just as he finished. "Ange, wait until..." Mina slowed to a stop. "Inspector, Ange, we aren't interrupting are we?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No," I replied and smiled. "The Inspector had more questions, but I was intimidated by his office and all the policemen there. He was kind enough to let me speak with him here." Luvy smiled and nudged Mina, but had the decency to not say anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, Lady Marsters. I think that answers most of the questions. Might I call on you again if I have any more?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I turned red when I saw Lucy mouth 'told you so' to Mina. "Of course, inspector." He rose, bowed to us, and left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lucy and Mina sat to each side of me and leaned in, "Tell us everything!" I started to spin a tale that might fit with a young woman of Ange's station, but was interrupted by a knock at the carriage door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ladies," said the man I recognized as taking care of the private platform. "Lord Wellingham sent a message that you should take the train around to his offices. There is a matter concerning Lady Marsters."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We stared at each other and Lucy answered, "Of course Philip. Thank you. Please alert the engineer. He may leave at his convenience." A few minutes later the train pulled out of the station.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* next time they talk - need to decide what happens next, should explain why they stay in contact with each other */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where do we go from here, inspector?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should arrest you for the murder of the Marsters family and the Whitechapel killings," I held my hands out, having seen enough arrests in Whitechapel, "but many of your deeds have helped the yard. No one would believe me anyway unless you were to confess?" I shook my head, "I didn't think so. You've put me in a very bad spot, Lady Marsters." He stood, agitation forcing him to pace around the room. "I like you, I have from the first night we met. You can't do that, can you? Force someone to like and trust you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, no. Only through the usual ways," it wasn't completely true, of course, but I hadn't used the persuasion on him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know where we go from here. This is beyond anything I expected. What about you? This becoming a Marsters places you in a spotlight and brings you access to rather large amounts of power and money. Are your intentions honorable or will I be forced to oppose you later?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is a storm coming, an upheaval beyond any that have been seen before. Visions tell me I can be of use, can make it less terrible, but I have to be entangled with the Wellinghams, and with..." I stopped, not wanting to tell the rest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lestrade seemed to miss the last part, instead asking, "What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I dug into the fragments, trying to find something that could be explained. "The world stands on the verge of a terrible war, one that will roll over Europe and kill millions. Power mad dabblers in non-rational things are working to release horrible things in the hopes of attaining more power. The Wellinghams are central to avoiding these terrors. I haven't seen how, yet." I looked at him, standing across from me, and saw determination and confusion, but not disbelief. "You are not as you seem either, inspector."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* another time - talking with Lestrade a few days after the deaths */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">frustration over the reduced status of women, frustration over the disposition of her house and the games Wellingham is having to play so she doesn't have to seel it and become subservient to her father's brother.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Iwas pacing around the room as I said, "It was strange enough when I was a poor person, but the restrictions on the women of nobility in the supposedly enlightened time are extremely vexing. In the Egypt of my time I could own property, recieve and determine inheritance, enter into contracts, get divorced and retain my property, but here, my father's brother has ownership of my home. He can determine who I marry, controls any moneys from my parents, and has total control over my life. How can you claim this is an advanced time when half your population is at the mercy of the other?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's the natural order of things." At least that's the belief. As a woman, you should be held exempt from the coarser affairs of the world. You should be pure and protected, kept safe and sheltered."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you honestly believe that after all you've told me about your life?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, but that is the way of things that I am supposed to protect as a member of the police."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
