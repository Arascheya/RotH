<p class="pagecaption">London: 1888: The Ripper - Morgue and Lestrade's Home</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* morgue */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's going on, Geof?" Petrie asked from beside my body.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean John?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Look at this, right here," I felt a sharp poke at some of the flesh on my ribs. "There should be necrosis and drying in these tissues, yet they look freshly cut. According to this, she would have to have died in the last half hour, yet we know that isn't true." Lestrade must have reacted because the doctor added, "This one means something to you. You aren't usually this distracted or bothered by a victim you don't know. What's your connection to this woman?" I heard them move away and sounds of equipment being moved. There was a sharp intake of breath, then, "Geof, look at this. Her cells are regeneratingand what is that with the blood? This isn't possible. What do you know about this girl? More than I'd expect, judging by your look."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can't talk here and we need to get her out of here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's not dead, is she?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, she's not. I have some room at my place, once we get her there, I'll try and explain. Trust me, please John."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you crazy? How do we make this body disappear, when everyone is watching this case?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Simple, everything about this case has been mishandled. We accidentally sign out the wrong body and call it just one more problem."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But why, John? Why is this case so muddled?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Someone wants it to go away. It's the only way so many good cops could produce such terrible work."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">I heard his voice from a great distance, swearing as he tripped over something in the room. The chair creaked slightly as he sat close to me and warmth enfloded my left hand as he wrapped his fingers around mine. "You fool, he hissed. Do you know how hard it was to get you out of the morgue? I told them someone had come to claim you, but I'm not sure they belived it. You better be alive in there. What were you thinking, pulling a stupid stunt like this?" I wanted to wake up and tell him he had agreed when I'd suggested it, but I wasn't that far along yet. A single tear escaped and tracked down the ruins of my face. "So you are alive. I wish to hell you'd told me what I could do to help you heal." Blackness claimed me again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* this is several days later - she should be down for over a week - Lestrade will need to tell the Wellinghams something */</p>
<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">When I clawed my back to conciousness again, I forced my right hand to move, first pointing at the crude bandages, then miming drinking. It took many tries before he said, "Blood, you want blood? Oh, squeeze my hand once for yes, twice for no." I squeezed once. "The hospital won't have blood." I squeezed twice. "It can be animal blood?" One squeeze. "I'll be back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I recovered quickly once I started getting regular supplies of blood. It was the terrible, post butchering stuff, but it was enough.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/*Mary can reappear after the killer is dealt with - Ange could have to take him on when partially healed to protect Mary - will need Lestrade and Petrie to help */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Lestrade and Mere will become lovers once she has recovered from the ripper attack as Mary. They will remain lovers until just before the Hut departure in 1895. Mary should become a good friend somewhere in this time frame. Mary was born in 1863 and is 25 at the time of the attacks. Lestrade should be 30 around the time of the ripper killings. */</p>
