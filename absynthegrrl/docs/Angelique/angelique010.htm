<p class="pagecaption">The Hut: Reflections</p>
<p class="regtxt5">These reflections are random thoughts I had while compiling the snapshot album. They aren't pictures as much as my trying to work through the differences of things at various points in my life. I apologize for the fragmentary and scattered nature of them. It is how they came up as I was reliving scenes of my past.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Religion</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Religion, spirituality, and my place in it has always been a difficult thing. My status as vampyr and the blessings and curses it conveys has a profound effect on how I percieve myself in the scheme of things.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The world of my childhood was polytheistic. We had gods for everything and each had their own special forms of worship. There was the god of the Nile, the village god, the god of the reigning pharaoh, and a host of others for all the important aspects of life. We didn't think much about religion and belief, other than to accept and practice it. I didn't either until the change into vampyr. When I started craving blood, having to move at night, and then with the aquisition of the necklace, I suddenly had some of the powers of the gods. I could regenerate from injuries, fight the strongest man and win, endure incredible pain and suffering and bounce right back. It called so much into question that I shoved it to the back of my mind for a long time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Monotheism confuses me. How can a single god keep track of everything? And if it can, why would it pick certain people and interfere with them, either in favor of or against? It made little sense when I first learned of it in Cairo, in 1883 when I arrived. It made no more sense after wandering London for years.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Revelation</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The revelation came after I was admitted to the Hut. Irena went to see someone in Sphere, the city at the center of everything. We knew when she came into her own. The shock waves bounced through all of us, stirring ghost-echoes of everything she was seeing. This was no vision brought about by extacy or drugs, this was raw truth revealed. In that instant I knew the truth of all creation. There were five true gods, things that could make or unmake the multiverse at their will. Two were imprisoned by the other three and Irena had awakened as one of the three. By extension we became the equal of the stronget proxy gods.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"God", a truly overworked word. What is a "god" but some extra powerful being that can do thinigs you can't. There had been gods in the time of my childhood, mostly silent, prayed to and beseeched for favors that randomly would work. There was a single god of London, but many different factions and sects praying to variants of it. Now we were as these gods, powerful, able to do what few could imagine. How do you explain that kind of power in words? And, more importantly, what did it mean? What were we supposed to do with this power?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I had thought becoming vampyr had been a change. It was nothing like the overwhelming sense of knowing that this new change brought. All I had to do was wonder about something and everything known about it would flood into my awareness. I began to see, in a dim way, what Irena had meant when she tried to explain omniscience, that ability to see everything that removed all perspective from it. A true case of too much information to focus in on. So much that even the overview was impossible to grasp.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Within the Hut we had atained a form of shared empathy. We could dimly sense the feels of each other. After the awakening we could easily sense these feelings and almost read each other's thoughts. It was scary and wonderful  at the same time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Roles of Women</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I would have expected things to remain the same or get better for women as history unfolded. What I found in Cairo, Alexandria, and London was the opposite. The rise of Christianity, Islam, and other variants of the single sky god religions had reduced women to subservient brood mares. The worst of it was they had convinced women that they were being "protected" from the base things in life and from the degradations of having to interact with the world. What I saw in the streets was despicable. Women being beaten, struck, and cursed for daring to speak or have an opinion counter to that of the man near her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Worse, women were denied any legal protections in terms of property and personal rights. I saw a woman stoned on my travels from Cairo to Alexandria because she had the audacity to be raped by some man. He wasn't even questioned about his intent. He won't be attacking anyone else, I made certain of that, but there was no way I could redress every wrong.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An unmarried woman was less than nothing in the higher circles of Angle-land, um, England. Widows had no guarantee of any assistance after the death of a husband. In my childhood we were equal to men in more ways. We could own property, enter into contracts, and decide the fate of our property at death. We were also subject to the consequences of those actions, but why shouldn't we have been? To be reduced to property was disgusting. How it had happened was very hard to sort out. I have many theories, but they are just that.</p>
