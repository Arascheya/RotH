<p class="pagecaption">London: 2066 - Arrival</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The translation gong sounded, then pain exploded in a crushing blast like I had never felt before. Merciful blackness claimed me before I finished screaming.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I awoke with my head splitting with pain. Around me the Hut faltered, for lack of a better word. Where a steady thrumming, like a giant cat purring, had been, was a ragged stumbling groan. The room around me seemed thinner, darker, without as much color or substance as it usually had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A quiet groan from next to me reminded me where I was. Shandi sat up slowly, clutching her head, and staring around the room. Seeing fear in her eyes was the most disturbing thing yet. I had seen many emotions in my lovely demon girl's violet eyes, but I had never seen fear before. "It's broken. The Hut is dying around us." Terror leapt at her words. Only when she was wired for battle or danger was she able to speak in clear, complete thoughts. The fact she was speaking was more terrifying than her words, which were frightening enough.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How? It is immortal, indestructible, isn't it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's majiks and technology suffer from entropy, like the rest of the multi-verse. We have taxed it too much and now it is failing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Irena will know what to do," I said with more confidence than I felt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We went from room to room, finding each of our friends comatose. Only Tyana, the ghost of the machine, was half awake, pain etched in every line of her face. She didn't speak but brought up displays showing the shattered backup power system and the failing main system. "Auto-repair can fix the main systems and the crew, but there is no backup power to run it. What is left of main power is being used to stabilize us. The Interface is locked to a realm, but I'm not sure which one. It is alive with electromagnetic energy, in frequencies and patterns I am not familiar with. You are the only two uneffected enough to do something," she lapsed into silence, the Hut sounding more ragged as she visibly caught her breath. "The defcon system activated. Hopefully it picked a shape that is not out of place. I must rest," she gasped as she faded from view,the screens fading with her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I looked at Shandi, then we walked slowly through the throne room and to the interface door. The panel we relied on to indicate the safety of the world outside was dark. With a shrug, I opened the door and carefully looked through.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was dark outside the door. The smell of plants, damp earth, and a thin spattering of rain drifted in on a puff of breeze. We were in an overgrown garden, near a tall brick building, close enough I could only see the wall from the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I led the way out, turning to see the hut was set to look like a small shed. Steady burning street lights cast dim pools of light into the garden we were in. The ground was scattered with rubish and syringes. A worn path led to a gate, set in a brick wall. I moved back so I could see the building and stopped when I recognized it. Memories crashed over me, dragging me to the ground. Shan rushed over, sank down near me, and held me as I shook. I knew this place. It was the board school next to where Mary Ann Nichols body had been found. The first of the Ripper victims, and a friend of mine. "Shit, shit, shit," I mummbled as she rocked me until I could stop shaking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She spoke with her hands, "What is it, love? Will you be ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I explained, slowly, with many stops and starts, about where we were. She looked around and asked, "Is this that London? It doesn't smell the same to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her question broke the haze. I looked, saw electric lights, heard noises that would never fit the 1800s, and slowly shook my head. "No, this is not." I struggled to me feet, slowly throwing off the last of the shakes. There was light through the windows of the building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi shrugged and walked toward the door. I trailed behind, afraid of what I would find and curious as well. The door opened into a large room. There were a dozen people scattered around, staring intently into display devices. There was a counter toward the back with a young woman behind it. My throat consticted tightly and I could only croak out, "Mary?" when I saw the redhead behind the counter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She had looked up as the door opened and was staring as well. "I know you, but it can't be. Angelique Marsters?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She asked at the same time I was able to say "Mary Kelly?" loud enough to be heard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, Angelique Mereret Lestrade." She was recoverig faster than I was. "I was named for the Inspector and Mary's first daughter. She was named for you. Where have you been? How did you get here? We need to talk, but not here." She pushed a button under the counter and Lien Hua Petrie stepped from a door behind the counter. "Lien, could you watch the shop for a bit? There are two in the archives to check out. Yasmine Raizul and a street kid with cash."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It must have been the damage to the hut, but I wasn't recovering as fast as usual. I knew it couldn't be Lien Hua in front of me, but she was identical to Dr. Petrie's wife. I staggered after the girl, following her into the back and into a richly furnished, soundproof room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is one of the archive index rooms. It is based on the original idea the inspector set up so long ago. We have expanded over the hundred plus years our famiies have owned the shop." She smiled slightly and continued, "I know, Kara and I look like our long dead ancestors. I apologize for the surprise. Is the Hut here? Is that how you came? Is this Shandi with you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, uh, yes, this is Shandi. You know of the Hut?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. The inspector left very thorough private notes. Don't worry. They are in a part of the archives that remain unavailable to the general populace."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* CONSIDER: update to make Mere more fucked up, so Shandi has to do a lot of the early work on her own - this would work into the Diane Lestrade story better */</p>
