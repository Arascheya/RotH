<p class="pagecaption">London: 1888: The Ripper - Mary</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By early November I had all but given up trying to find more on the man Mary told me about. I had no visions and no one I knew had any more idea than I did. I had decided on one last try the night of November 8th. Slipping back into the Emily Crooksley overlay I returned to my old haunts in Spitalfields, stopping in to the Ten Bells for a pint and not staying long. The place felt empty without Lizzie there. I took a quick turn down Commercial and then slipped into the Britannia for a pint and a break from the chill. Mary waved me over to where she was leaning heavily against the bar. "Emmy, ha a drink wi me," she slurred out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure Mary." I lifted a pint and the room wavered. I sagged back and would have fallen if Mary hadn't caught me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Emmy, ya ok, luv? Another o' yer spells?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When she touched me I saw a knife in the hand of a well-dressed animal carving pieces out of Mary, where she lay on her bed. "Ah," I couldn't speak as I clung to her, each image more horrible than the last.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I got ya," she said again as she helped me to a table. I fell into the chair and bounced my head on the surface. The pain pierced the cascade for a moment. "Emmy?" her voice was all fear as she pulled my head up and tried to gaze into my unfocused eyes. "Emmy!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mary," I managed to whisper through the cotton in my mouth.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I' ere, what ya need, luv?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The images shifted slightly. "Gin, in a glass," I croaked out and pressed coins into her hand. She headed for the tapman and the images shifted again. She put the almost full glass in my hand, her fingers briefly touching mine, and the images exploded again. This time the knife came for my throat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Emmy?" Mary said as she pulled back from me. It took me a moment to realize and remove the predatory grin that had crept over my face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mary?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wha was 'at?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tha face ya made."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just longing for the gin. Did you get one for yourself too?" She shook her head and I pressed a few more coins into her hand. "Don't make me drink alone." She smiled and went to get herself a glass. By the time she returned I was almost back to normal and trying to piece together the changes. "What brings you out tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tha landlor's comin fer me money in tha mornin, an' i'm out ta get it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"YOu know you aren't safe alone. I can lend you some, how much you need?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Emmy, I can't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure you can. You helped me, now I can help you." I pressed some money into her hand. "How about I help you home?" I waited until she looked into my eyes and set the persuasion on her. It was a nasty trick, and one I hated to use, but I had to get her somewhere other than her place. Once I saw it was working, I said, "Mary, I'm going to take you to a friend's place tonight. You will be safe there. I have to go back out,but Lottie is a friend. You can trust her too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I walked us to Lottie's place, but, before going in, I bit Mary on the back of the neck and slipped in the probes. Once I had introduced her to Lottie and shehad fallen asleep on a divan, I snuck a second bite to gather the probes. "Lottie, Mary should be safe come morning. I have to go back out, but will try to be back when she wakes up. If I'm not, could you try and get her to eat before she leaves?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure Emmy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need to get Mary somewhere safe before assuming her appearance - has she sampled Mary or does she need to now? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she can use some visions to get needed data - just remember the dissociation with reality is slowly getting worse when she does - from Mary finds out he is looking for people who saw him dumping bodies, Mary was one, from contact with the ripper she finds out he has been engaged in experimentation with various missing persons for years - body count is closer to 15 to 20 - finds out he was connected with London Hospital and sees his home/work area - consider having the ripper "kill" mereret and then her having to slip out of the morgue and hunt him down, knowing her friend is still in danger from him - alternately, he kills her and takes her body because of the odd things he observed while interacting with her - leaves lots of blood but no body in Mary's room */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* victims - Mary Ann Nichols 31 Aug 1888 - Annie Chapman 8 Sept 1888 - Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddows 30 Sept 1888 - Mary Jane Kelly 9 Nov 1888 */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* for a serial, there is quite a gap between Sept and Nov - there should be others, just not found, that Ang finds out about when she take down the killer */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* the attack */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He followed me into Mary's room, a simple affair with a small grate, a bed, a table, and a small wardrobe. I pulled the hat off and smiled, "Make yourself comfortable. How do you want me?" He moved past me and I grabbed him, sunk my fangs in, and started the injection. His blood hit my throat and I choked. Spots swam in front of my eyes and I doubled over, poisoned by something in his blood. He hauled me up by my hair and threw me onto the bed. I curled tightly around the fire in my throat and guts. His knife flashed across my throat and blood exploded everywhere. The pain was a bright flash, but I couldn't sceam. Frantic, I shoved up and managed to get a bite on his arm. Drawing the half sample in as he backhanded me onto the bed again. The knife flashed again and again, tearing through my skin, slashing across my face, chest, abdomen and legs. Conciousness faded fast as blood poured from me.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">"Idiot girl, You didn't tell me you were going tonight. I almost didn't hear about this." Lestrade hissed in my ear. His voice pulled me back to conciousness. I couldn't see, could barely hold onto conciousness, and couldn't speak. It took a moment to remember why.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you say something inspector?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, just surprised at the state of the body. Where's Abberline and do we have any witnesses?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, sir. A few who said they saw her come in with a gentleman, but no descriptions and no one saw when he left. Wish they would have sent the dogs. Can't even tell if she was a pretty one. Abberline should be here soon."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She... It shouldn't matter, PC Lamb. She is still the victim."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, sir, was just wondering. What he did to her face isn't right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want this bastard caught!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you alright sir?" Lamb asked, catching the strain in Lestrade's voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I want this killer caught. I want our city to be free of this constant fear. Has someone sent for Dr. Petrie? We should get a post mortem and then get the poor girl out of here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I drifted in and out of awareness until I heard Lestrade again. "Doctor, let us know when we can move her to the morgue."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course." For a long while there was the sound of a pen on paper as the doctor examined me, then he said, "Ok, you can move her. Have the body taken to the London Hospital morgue. I'll do the final examinations there." I had thought I was beyond the pain of the injuries until they lifted me and carried me to a cart. I wish I could have screamed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* post mortem - details of injuries - from <a href="http://www.casebook.org/victims/mary_jane_kelly.html">Casebook.org</a> */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dr. Thomas Bond, a distinguished police surgeon from A-Division, was called in on the Mary Kelly murder. His report is as follows:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The body was lying naked in the middle of the bed, the shoulders flat but the axis of the body inclined to the left side of the bed. The head was turned on the left cheek. The left arm was close to the body with the forearm flexed at a right angle and lying across the abdomen.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The right arm was slightly abducted from the body and rested on the mattress. The elbow was bent, the forearm supine with the fingers clenched. The legs were wide apart, the left thigh at right angles to the trunk and the right forming an obtuse angle with the pubes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The whole of the surface of the abdomen and thighs was removed and the abdominal cavity emptied of its viscera. The breasts were cut off, the arms mutilated by several jagged wounds and the face hacked beyond recognition of the features. The tissues of the neck were severed all round down to the bone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The viscera were found in various parts viz: the uterus and kidneys with one breast under the head, the other breast by the right foot, the liver between the feet, the intestines by the right side and the spleen by the left side of the body. The flaps removed from the abdomen and thighs were on a table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bed clothing at the right corner was saturated with blood, and on the floor beneath was a pool of blood covering about two feet square. The wall by the right side of the bed and in a line with the neck was marked by blood which had struck it in a number of separate splashes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The face was gashed in all directions, the nose, cheeks, eyebrows, and ears being partly removed. The lips were blanched and cut by several incisions running obliquely down to the chin. There were also numerous cuts extending irregularly across all the features.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The neck was cut through the skin and other tissues right down to the vertebrae, the fifth and sixth being deeply notched. The skin cuts in the front of the neck showed distinct ecchymosis. The air passage was cut at the lower part of the larynx through the cricoid cartilage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Both breasts were more or less removed by circular incisions, the muscle down to the ribs being attached to the breasts. The intercostals between the fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs were cut through and the contents of the thorax visible through the openings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The skin and tissues of the abdomen from the costal arch to the pubes were removed in three large flaps. The right thigh was denuded in front to the bone, the flap of skin, including the external organs of generation, and part of the right buttock. The left thigh was stripped of skin fascia, and muscles as far as the knee.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The left calf showed a long gash through skin and tissues to the deep muscles and reaching from the knee to five inches above the ankle. Both arms and forearms had extensive jagged wounds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The right thumb showed a small superficial incision about one inch long, with extravasation of blood in the skin, and there were several abrasions on the back of the hand moreover showing the same condition.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On opening the thorax it was found that the right lung was minimally adherent by old firm adhesions. The lower part of the lung was broken and torn away. The left lung was intact. It was adherent at the apex and there were a few adhesions over the side. In the substances of the lung there were several nodules of consolidation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The pericardium was open below and the heart absent. In the abdominal cavity there was some partly digested food of fish and potatoes, and similar food was found in the remains of the stomach attached to the intestines."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dr. George Bagster Phillips was also present at the scene, and gave the following testimony at the inquest:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The mutilated remains of a female were lying two-thirds over towards the edge of the bedstead nearest the door. She had only her chemise on, or some underlinen garment. I am sure that the body had been removed subsequent to the injury which caused her death from that side of the bedstead that was nearest the wooden partition, because of the large quantity of blood under the bedstead and the saturated condition of the sheet and the palliasse at the corner nearest the partition.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The blood was produced by the severance of the carotid artery, which was the cause of death. The injury was inflicted while the deceased was lying at the right side of the bedstead."</p>
