<p class="pagecaption">London: 1887: Angelique's Rebirth</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I had gone to the Prince of Whales Theatre to see Dorothy, a comic opera in three acts, at the recommendation of my friend Charlotte. It was the furthest into west London I had ventured and it surprised me how many common people were in the audience. Somehow I had expected the crowd to be mostly upper classes. It was not as fancy on the outside as the Gaiety where Charlotte performed, but inside it was very ornate and immaculately kept. By comparison, the Gaiety was worn and threadbare.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was moving slowly up the stairs to the gallery, the only seats I could afford, and watching the crowds, when a rude younger man pushed by me, dragging a young woman along behind him. She bumped into me when he tugged her hand and images shot through me. If an older gentleman hadn't caught me, I would have fallen to the floor. Instead he helped me down a short hall and into his private box. "Are you alright, young miss? The young today can be so rude."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Betrayal, death, poison, world of death, world of light, unknowing pivot hanging in the life of a girl. Gears of numbers, doors, doors everywhere, from everywhere, to everywhere. Ah, must save her, no become her, where..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Miss, miss! What are you talking about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly the rich surroundings came back into focus. A worried older face stared at me, heavy jowled, distinguished, with a thick head of white hair and piercing blue eyes, confusion and worry obvious in his stare. "Ah, I get these spells, sir. I will be fine in a few moments." I rose to leave.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please sit. Stay and watch from here. I wouldn't mind the company and I think the time would do you benefit." He placed a gentle hand on my arm and the images surged again. Vast machines, tumbling rows of numbers, tunnels, trains, soaring buildings under oceans of glass, metal birds swallowing people. I sank back into the other chair with a small whimper. His other hand pulled a small rope. Within moments an usher slid into the back of the box. "Please get this young lady whatever she desires."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Gin, please," I managed to get out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bring a bottle of the best, a glass, water for both of us, a whiskey, and two glasses of Amontillado. Thank you," my benefactor added. "I am Henry Babbage. May I ask your name?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Polly, Polly Tanner."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He touched his lips to the back of my hand and said, "Pleased to meet you, Miss Tanner."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nexus, convergence, convolution, images, images, too fast..." my head lolled back as they sucked me down. Central to all of the images was the girl who had bumped me on the stairs. She would die outside the theatre this night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A hand gently shook me. "Drink this," Henry said as he put a glass to my lips. Smooth gin sloshed down my throat, its fire pulling me back to the box and the show in front of me. "Are you sure you are going to be alright?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry. This comes over me. I've been to physicians, but they don't know what to make of it." The gin helped, but the images wouldn't let go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How long has this been happening to you? I know several very capable men of medicine, ones you might not be able to afford on your own, if you want to try again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh no, dear sir, I couldn't possibly impose in that way. I would never be able to repay you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nonsense my dear. I am an old man, with plenty of money and little to spend it on. It would be my pleasure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, I don't know. I'll need to think about it. The last experience was rather unpleasant and without benefit. How would I get a message to you if I were to accept your kindness?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Send a note to this address," Henry responded as he pulled out a small card. The curtain slid aside as he finished speaking and the show began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tried to concentrate on the play, which was about disguise, love, and misdirection, but the girl's face wouldn't leave my thoughts. Somewhere during the first act Henry handed me a glass of the Amontillado and its amber depths called up the ruby pool of the necklace and a flickering image of the girl floating in it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The familiar red tinge as I dove in was calming. The images began to take shape, showing the young man and a rough accomplice determining the death of the young woman. An older woman hovered behind the young man, her arms around him, caressing his face. I must have made a sound because Henry was once more calling me back, trying to speak with me. It took a long moments swimming through endless variations before I could respond, "Henry?" He handed me another glass of gin and waited while I took a long drink. "Trying to get me drunk and have your way with me?" He stiffened for a moment until he saw my wavering smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, it's the only recourse of us old men," he replied with a warm smile. "Is there anything that helps with the fits? Will you be alright?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not really. Mostly I have to wait them out. This one is lasting longer than most and I'm not sure why."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Henry kept pulling me back from the visions when I'd start to moan or thrash around too much. I could stay distanced for only a few minutes at a time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I rose as the play came to an end and rapidly excused myself. I hurried as fast as I could down the stairs and into the lobby, hoping to catch up the girl before she left the theatre. She was walking out the door as I reached the lobby. Outside, I dashed to the alley where the visions showed her death. Half way down it a larger figure had a smaller one shoved against the wall. I ran toward them</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My fiance is just up the way, getting a carriage," the woman was saying as I closed in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who do you think hired me? He said we could have some fun with you afterwards."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was moving, but his knife slid into her before I got to him. He died an instant later as I snapped his neck. The girl was fading fast, blood pouring from a gaping slash high on her belly, but had enough life in her to plead, "Tell Lord Wellingham, my brother is in danger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who are you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Angelique. His niece. Tell him, please." She slipped into unconsciousness. I could feel the blood flowing around my pressed hands getting slower. I desperately wanted to ask her more about the Wellinghams and herself. If I could have stabilized her I could have probed her, but there was no time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was almost gone when a soft voice asked, "Emergency assimilation?" My mind responded yes while I was trying to understand. I bit my tongue, smeared the blood on my fingers, and pressed them into the wound under my other hand. When her blood slowed to almost stopping, I dropped my face into it and sucked some up. Memory fragments exploded in my consciousness. It was more immediate and less clear than a standard sampling, but I could tell there would be information there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The voice asked again, "Annihilate target and emergency shift?" My yes had me transferring another bit of blood as I was trying to understand more words. I/she watched as my/her body dissolved in front of us. Her memories were flowing to the surface and I was changing while I was still trying to sort through her memories. Looking back it is hard to describe the panic, fear, and lack of understanding I had when this occurred. Now I know what I can do and how the sampling things in my blood work. They are far more powerful than I realized at that time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The shift was finishing when a male voice called into the shadows where I was, "Is it done yet? How hard can it be to kill a girl?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very hard," I replied in the girl's voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Angelique?" His voice shook as he said her name.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stephen," I purred, quickly slipping close to him. "What a silly game you played," I added as I kissed him savagely, shoving him hard against the wall and pinning him in place. He was strong, but not strong enough to dislodge me as I sucked his tongue into my mouth, bit it, and commanded, "Emergency assimilation with annihilation," as my blood mixed with his. As soon as the information was gathered I snapped his neck and dropped him by the other body. It dissolved into dust and clothes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I shifted into his form, leaned over and hurled into the gutter, then changed into his clothes. I could use male overlays but they always felt wrong somehow, causing nausea and disorientation for a time after the change. Once I was past the worst of the reaction, I tossed the dresses in a nearby waste bin and headed for the street to hail a cab.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I gave the cabby Angelique's address and settled in for the trip. As the cab bumped over the cobbles of the street, the whole sordid plan filtered slowly into my mind. Step-mother was going to murder the girl, Angelique's, father, her brother, her father's brother, and then marry Angelique's fiance, to gain access to his family. Step-mother planned to use her new husband to help her murder his family and collect the money from both families. I couldn't stop the second round of nausea, brought on by the man form and the sickness of their plans.</p>
