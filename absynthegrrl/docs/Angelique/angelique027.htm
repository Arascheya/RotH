<p class="pagecaption">London: 1889: Tea with Lien Hua</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lien Hua Petrie met me at the door to the apothecary shop. She led me through the shop and up to their living quraters above. I had been in the sitting room many times with Lestrade, when we would visit Dr. Petrie. Lien motioned me to follow her into another secton of their rooms. Beyond a regular door was a room unlike the rest of the home. Thick, red tapestries hung from with wall. Dragons were worked into them in shimmering thread. A simple laquered table sat in the center of the room with laquered chairs drawn up to it. In the center of the table was an elaborate tea set, with white porcelain cups, a dark brown earthenware pot, water heating over a small brazier, and a bowl of dark, coiled tea leaves. A trail of floral scented smoke trailed from a bronze bell shaped holder nearby.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lady Marsters, the men are always talking. I thought it would be nice for us to have time to ourselves. If you have no objections, I would like to begin with traditional tea, done the way my family has for generations."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would like that," I answered, as I sat where she indicated. I examined the tea, when it was shown to me, inhaling the smoky fragrance and observing what Lien said was the perfect curl of the cured leaves. Then I watched her place the tea in the pot, cleanse it, then brew it. She poured the results into small cups, then up-ended them into slightly larger cups. She motioned for me to lift the small cup from the one nearest me. I mimiked her lifting the small cup, inhaling the fragrance that clung to it, then sip the tea.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was exquisite. English tea was not bad, in terms of flavor, but the flavors were never as clear as what we drank. She prepared two more brewings, then carefully cleaned and polished the tea set. Lastly, she bowed and thanked me for attending.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She let the quiet of the room seep into us until the incense stopped smoking. "This city is always hurrying about. Sometimes it is good to take time for quiet." A few minutes later she said, "I would like to kow more about you. To that end, I would like to share some of my past with you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I met Petrie when his regiment was stationed near our village. He wasn't like any of the other offices. He had a genuine kindness and acceptance of my people. Many of the others didn't consider us human, or worth any action except defilement. Although some would rape us before discarding us. My family was killed when my younger sister refused the advances of an English officer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How can you be so calm about that?" I asked, stunned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was years ago now, and I had my revenge. The officer had a fondness for opium. It was easy to help him get too much. It doesn't bring them back, but he won't do it again. We all have secrets we wouldn't like to get out into the world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I appreciate the circumspection in asking me about myself, however, what is it you are wondering about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is much about you that puzzles me. Probably the most puzzling thing is how you speak to Petrie and Lestrade as if they are equal to you. Some women try that, as a rebelion, but there is always hesitation. Not from you. How did a woman of the upper classes learn to be that way? The other thing is the supplies Lestrade ordered from me. They have a striking similarity with a recipe I've seen for something called an 'illuminating poison' from the time of Cleopatra VII of Egypt."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why would Lestrade's order make you think of me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Because he let it slip that it was. I think you are a night drinker, a very old and powerful one, since you can move about during the day. Legends in my land say some of the truly ancient can shift their shape, to throw off the hunters. Very old legends speak of a master drinker, a walker of the day, that can walk without fear in the day and control any drinker that they come into contact with. This master came from the lands of Egypt, from the dawn of time, but disappeared from legend at the end of Egypt. She was said to have a curious and elaborate tatoo, the pattern of which was never reported."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stared at her, for longer than I should have, if I were going to deny her thoughts. "Wouldn't it be very dangerous to know a secret like that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I imagine it would be, but Lestrade is carrying a heavy burden and he won't share it with Petrie. This is the first time I've seen a secret between them. And I see you carrying one as well. You carry it as if you have had it for a long time, but it is weighing you down. I want to help the two of you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stared at her again, finaly saying, "There are two secrets. That the Inspector and I are lovers is the first. The second is more involved." For the second time in this awakening I found myself explaining what I was.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time I finished,her eyes were shining with excitement. She started asking questions, not the easy ones, but hard ones about how I dealt with everyone around me dying, how I chose food, and what Egypt had been like under the pharaohs. The questons went on for a long time, until she asked, "Does the Inspector know this? How are you preventing complicatons from your relations?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, he knows. The other is simple. I am unable to have children."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May I explain some of this to the Dr.? It hardly seems fair that Lestrade has to keep this from his best friend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can, or I can, or we both can. You are right, it isn't fair to Lestrade."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can explain when they arrive later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought drinkers didn't eat, yet you have dined with us many times."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The food isn't as effective for sustaining me, but I have always enjoyed the flavors and textures. I can't imagine giving it up."</p>
