<p class="regtxt5">I felt it when the man arrived. The very air around me tore and shivered with the force of it. Lestrade's face showed concern as I fell against him, his arms alone keeping me from falling to the ground. We were in Hyde Park, taking a stroll along the Serpentine, when it happened. Chaos erupted in my mind, images shattering my thoughts and driving themselves out through a jumble of words. "Replacement, lover to Wellingham, first of the others, gems of power, hut of storms." My head lolled on Lestrade's shoulder. He held me, stroked my hair, and spoke quietly to me, providing a thin life-line in the thrashing waves of images.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This was not like any other time, they kept coming, more chaotic and jumbled than ever before. Minutes passed, turning into almost an hour, and they continued without respit. Lestrade lifted me to my feet and guided me along. I couldn't tell if I was walking a forest path, a street, through rooms, or what. I think there was a cab ride, then he guided me into a waiting area. Holding me upright and close, he spoke to someone I should have recognized, then there was another room. "What happened to her?" a man's voice asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, John. She has the fits I've told you about, but they never last this long."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How long has she been like this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Over an hour since she first collapsed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Light flickered back and forth across my sightless eyes. My head was turned, my pulse taken. "Geof, help me get some of this down her." John said from a distance. Bitter liquid slid down my throat, calling up visions of blood and poisons, and the awful stuff that had been Jekyl's blood. I tried to spit it out, fearing the coming pain, but Lestrade held me so I couldn't.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* gives her laudanum to slip her into sleep - she will find opiates will allow focusing during nexus storm events in her visions - this first time, it allows her to see the Jekyl replacement - she will require heavy doses during the first days of the Hut arrival - Lien Hua would know how to dose her with laudanum or through smoking to bring the focus - she might be the one to suggest it in the first place if she sees Ange brought in by Lestrade */</p>
