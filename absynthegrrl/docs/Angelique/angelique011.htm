<p class="pagecaption">Portraits: Irena Katarya</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Irena is a tall woman, at least for the time in which I met her. She is neither old nor young, with the beginnings of lines in her face. Her form is more natural than the Londoners I met. I doubt she wore a corset before arriving in London. Her pale green eyes looked right through people, seeming to uncover their deepest secrets and making it impossible for them to lie to her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her most remarkable feature is her presence, she radiates power like one born to rule. I haven't seen anyone with that level of assurance since Hatshepsut. She moves with a grace and power that is at odds with the other women of London. She has none of the hesitent defference present in all women of the time. Even the Queen of England has a bit of that defference to men. This presence let her walk where she wished, ask for what she wanted, and receive defference and respect from the most mysogenistic of men.</p>
