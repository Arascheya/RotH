<p class="pagecaption">London: 1888: The Ripper - Lizzie and Kate</p>
<!--
<p class="regtxt5">"Lizzie!!" my own shout woke me from the horrible dream but the images didn't fade. Instead they intensified until I could barely see the room around me through the view of blood pouring from her throat and pooling on the rough stone where she fell. A dark figure turned at the sound of footsteps in the distance and cursed under his breath. I dressed as fast as I could then ran for the door. "Benson, the carriage, quickly!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes mum." I heard him racing down the steps, shouting for the carriage driver as he went.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The driver was pulling his coat on in the kitchen when I arrived. "Mum, the carriage will be ready shortly. Where will we be going?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bricklayer's Arms Pub, Whitechapel, as quickly as we can and try to avoid constabulary interactions please." He paled visibly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mum, at this time of..." his voice trailed off as he saw my look. "Yes mum, Sorry mum." We took off downthe streets, going as fast as safety allowed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Leave me and find somewhere to wait," I told him as we approached the pub. He muttered an affirmative and drove off slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* start at Lottie's house, Polly Tanner overlay */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I grabbed the shabby clothing from Lottie's spare closet and changed into them. Once I was out of her place and into the streets, it was easy to find a dark corner to shift into Emily Crooksley, Emily and the Polly overlay having the same build, just different features.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stared into the red pool, then dragged imaginary fingers threw it. A small yard and an empty street shimmered into view. Lizzie walked slowly down it, arms entangled with a dark man. A sign behind them said "The Nelson". I was running as I pulled back from the pool. Down New Road to Commercial, right on Cmmercial to Berner, and then left on Berner. Ahead a small knot of police and people stared at something. "Lizzie!" It came out a frantic shout as I ran up. A burly policeman turned to stop my head-long rush.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hold up there. Do you know the deceased?" He stared at me, then asked almost kindly, "We need someone to identify the deceased. Are you able to help?" I swallowed hard and nodded. He stepped aside and let me look at the scene. It was exactly as I had expected, down to the last detail.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stared at him for a minute, recognition coming slowly. He was PC Lamb from the Marsters investigation. "That's Lizzie, Elizabeth Stride. We are, were, friends."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Easy, there'll be time for you to tell us what you know later. For now, let the others work."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I almost ran to Lestrade, when he arrived many long minutes later. Instead, I stood to the side, unease growing as time went on. By the time I saw Lamb point me out to Lestrade, fear was clawing up from the red pool. I risked a glance and froze, watching the same dark figure slip up on Kate Eddows. "Inspector," I called. "I need..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shut it miss," another policeman said, almost kindly. "You wait for him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lestrade waved me his way at the same time. "What is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Inspector, can I speak with you alone?" He looked annoyed, but something promted him to agree. "Lamb, I will be on the other side of the street, talking to this lady." Lamb nodded as we walked off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now, what can't you say in front of them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's going to be another murder, not far from her. Same killer, the ripper. I know the other target."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who are you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's me, Geof, Mereret." He froze as his brain tried to see it. I quickly related the incident with his aunt and he relaxed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who is this mask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is Emily Crooksley. She was a friend to Lizzie, Elizabeth Stride, our victim. We need to go, now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lead us to it. Lamb, you and Smith come with me. The rest of you, stay here. I have summoned Dr. Petrie. No one touch the body until he arrives," Lestrade commanded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I ran for the scene where Kate would be. Back up Berner to Commercial, left on Commercial to Whitechapel, and down to Mitre Square. I slid to a halt as a police whistle sounded. We rounded the corner, into the square, and found PC Watkins standing near a body. "No," I screamed in anguish and would have colapsed to the ground if Lestrade hadn't caught me, getting strange looks from Lamp and Smith. "These were my friends, Geof," I whispered sharply to Lestrade. "I want who did this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"As do I. We're going to have to question you," he whispered back. "Smith, go back and get Petrie, when he's finished with Miss Stride. Watkins, keep people back. We wait for Petrie, before we do anything else."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes sir," Smith answered as he left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know," I answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lamb came over and looked to Lestrade. "We should question this woman, Inspector."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My thoughts exactly, Lamb. I know you want to move up. How about you try thinking like an Inspector and ask the questions? I'll ask any you didn't think of," Lestrade replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Miss Crooksley, you came running up to the last victim like you expected trouble, yet no one saw you here earlier. Would you care to explain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We...me and Lizzie were supposed to meet at the Bricklayer's, ah Bricklayer's Arms and then head out to...ah...to... And I missed her there so then I headed over toward The Nelson, sometimes we meet there and..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So you were going out together tonight. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...we...needed money for this guy, he threatened to cut me up so I couldn't work for not paying him enough protection. And no, I won't give you a name. He'd kill me before you could stop him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That won't do, miss. This is a murder investigation. I'm going to have to ask you for his name."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"McKennough, Thomas McKennough," I answered reluctantly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You talked to the Inspector, then we ran for here, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had a feeling..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come on Miss, you expect us to believe that? Are you in league with this monster? Is that how you knew?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No! Look, sir, I, I've chased the dragon. Ever since, I , I'm not right, sir. I can't answer what I don't know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Chased the dragon?" Lamb asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Opium, Lamb," Lestrade supplied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, right, sir. You claim an opium dream gave you this? I've never heard of that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you ever had the opium, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It gives dreams, sir, beautiful, powerful dreams. Can I go now? I don't know any more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just a few more questions, Miss," Lestrade answered. "Lamb, any more questions?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, I don't think so, sir."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here are a few more for next time. Miss, how do you know these two women? When was the last time you saw them alive? Did you notice anything strange over the past couple of days?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We've roomed together. Then we went out together, what with all the pimps, we got to stay together. We met up at the Ten Bells a few days ago. But I've not seen anything odd. May I go now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where do you live? We might want to speak to you again," Lamb asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"23 Flower and Dean, in a basement room. Ask anyone for Emmy and you'll find me."</p>
