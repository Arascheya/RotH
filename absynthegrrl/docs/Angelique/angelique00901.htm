<p class="pagecaption">London: 1888: Ripper - After Lizzie and Kate</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I walked up to the Northumberland Arms just as Lestrade appeared from the other corner. He escorted me in, just as he had so many times before. This time he had Amanda lead us to a private room, upstairs and looking out over the street. "Your usuals?" We answered with yes and sat back to wait.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once Amanda was out of sight, I started, "I didn't get a chance to ask what Dr. Petrie found last night."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing new. Jack knows how to clean up after himself and leave no evidence. Same basic pattern, just that the killer must have been interrupted with Miss Stride. We think that's why the second murder."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something about this doesn't seem right. This feels more deliberate than just random murders. It seems too coincidental that I knew all of the victims. I just wish I knew why."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did the five of you do anything out of the ordinary?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There were six of us. I did, but the others, not really. The only difference I remember is we would go around together for safety. A lot of the others wouldn't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who was the sixth?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mary Jane Kelly. I need to talk to her, see if she knows anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* needs to talk to Lestrade and find Mary */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* find Mary through barman at Ten Bells - as Emily */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* this needs to be closer to the attack point */</p>
