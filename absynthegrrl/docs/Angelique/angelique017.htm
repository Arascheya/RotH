<p class="pagecaption">London: 1887: Family Matters</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Everyone in London has heard of International Transportation Consortium, the parent company of the famed Oriental and Grand European Express rail system. I knew it was a thriving business, but had never seen the main offices until now. The enormous group of buildings occupied the area between St. Pancras and King's Cross railroad stations. The train pulled into the yards, drifted across countless sidings and spurs, and finally came to a stop by a beautifully appointed office building. Lucy led the way from the platform, through a maze of corridors and rooms, to her father's office. A young man looked up, smiled at us, and waved us in. Lord Wellingham rose and motioned us to chairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry to intrude on your day of shopping and relaxation, but a serious matter has come up. A solicitor for Angelique's family has sent copies of her father and step-mother's wills." He motioned to a thick envelope sitting on his desk. Surprisingly, he hadn't opened it. He saw my reaction and replied, "Unlike many in this time, I prefer to treat the women around me as capable. It is a lesson Lady Wellingham has to repeat from time to time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I opened the packet and scanned through the papers. Much of it was couched in terms I didn't understand. "Pardon me, uncle, but my father wasn't so enlightened. Would you please tell me what this means?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. Lucy, Mina, when we are finished here, please begin teaching Angelique what you know of legalities and finance. I won't have her kept ignorant any longer." He scanned through the documents, his face growing more troubled with each page. "It seems your father and his brother left everything to your step-mother's son. There are provisions for her brother, Richard, to hold the house, lands, and moneys in trust until he comes of age. You are to be obedient to Richard until you marry. You are allowed to continue your engagement to young Abernathy with the intent that you will marry him as soon as he proposes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I went pale at his words. I had thought the state of the poor women in London was bad. I was finding that the wealthy women were in far worse circumstances. There was little information in Angelique's fragmented memories about Uncle Richard, but what was there showed him to be a vile-tempered man with a thirst for wealth. I opened my mouth to protest but Lucy beat me, "Father, this is unacceptable!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lucy! I agree with you, however, you must learn to keep your council while considering options. Immediately speaking allows the other a chance to out-manuever you. Angelique, do you wish to be held to this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do I have a choice?" I had leared Lucy's lesson thousands of years ago, in the house of Imhotep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You do. I am your other uncle and I will file against this if you desire. It would require a few things to satisfy the law. You would have to live at our estate, I can't get the house or estates back. They came through your father. I won't be able to get at much of the money either, however, I am well off enough to afford another daughter. Lucy and Mina will explain what that means when we are done."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, Lord Wellingham, I don't wish to be held to these documents."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very good. Lucy, ask young Cratchet to come in." Once the young man had arrived Lord Wellingham said, "Bob, please prepare the legal documents necessary for the adoption of my niece, Angelique Marsters. Include the findings, proposals, and documentation we discussed earlier and post it to our barristers right away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, sir."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And Bob, set up an account at London Bank for Lady Marsters, similar to the ones for Miss Wellingham and Miss Murrey. Starting amount to be the same as theirs. Add her to the protection listings and details as well. I expect her other uncle to take action. He will think her a valuable asset."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Protection lists?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am afraid I am very busy. Lucy, Mina, will you take Angelique home and explain her new life to her? Send the train back once you are at home."</p>
