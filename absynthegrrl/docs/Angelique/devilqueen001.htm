<p class="pagecaption">The Curse of Nefersheshet</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was awakened by a furious pounding on Davies' door at half past two in the morning. We had consumed rather too much brandy the night before, toasting the advancement of Davies from Inspector to Chief Inspector of Scotland Yard. I heard Davies struggle to the door. I had just reached the sitting room in time to hear Davies exclaim, "Powell, what on god's earth are you doing here? Weren't you in Egypt, exploring near Luxor?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let me in, Davies. There is a matter of gravest urgency I need your help with." He burst past Davies, rushing into the sitting room and hurrying over to the windows. I headed toward the gas lamps and the striker, stopping at his next words, "No lights. I might have been followed. Dr. Jekyll, didn't expect to find you here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We were celebrating Davies advancement. But, you were saying?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is it, man?" Davies asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are dangerous things happening in Egypt. There is open revolt by the army, seditious groups are seeking to throw out the French and us, and there are threats on the life of our appointed ruler, Tewfik Pasha."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, yes, Egypt is a mess. How does this concern us? The lesser races always balk at the rule of their betters, even as we bring them civilization and better lives," Davies replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have evidence that an ancient evil, out of the dark depths of the upper Nile, guides these uprisings. Further, I believe an emissary of this darkness has followed me here. Letters were found, on several of our dead, threatening to bring the war to us if we did not retreat from lands that are not ours. They are marked with the sigil of Nefersheshet, an evil witch-queen from the ancient past of Egypt. The natives believe this devil queen has come back to life to free them and to return the glory of the god-kings, the 'pharaohs' of their barbaric tongue."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But what is our part in this?" Davies asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lives are in danger. I am certain the emissary is charged with dispatching those that control the Egyptian plan here in London. I need your help to protect them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How will we kow whom to protect?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* breeds scorpions for special venom effects - talking to Dr. Holmes about it while the other two are being prepared for torture - Holmes needs to demonstrate a form of openness that does not exist in the others, this encourages Nefersheshet to consider him with honor and respect, breeds lotus plants for various effects, breeds cobras for the same - has access to all plants, animals, etc. from the East */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* later in the book, or in the second book */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The hood was pulled from my eyes. Faint incense purfumed the air. Delicate tapestries covered the walls. A small table was centered on a rich carpet. A woman was seated at a simple chair. There is that sense of jangling, grating self-importance many have, then there is the calm certainty of possessing enormous power. This woman was in that category, but so far beyond the rest that there would be no comparison. Her features were thin, hauty, and cold, with deep black eyes that cast shadows over everything they surveyed. It took my half stunned brain long moments to realize I was in the presence of Nefersheshet, the devil-queen of the East.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a long moment she just watched me, then she said,  "Good evening, my dear Dr. Jekyll. I apologize for the forcefulness of my dinner invitation, however, I did not wish the option of refusal. I see you are nervous. I pledge your safety for the duration of this evening, and a safe return to your lodgings. I ask that you pledge to not hurt any of mine or attempt to escape." Her voice was a musical, soothing purr, almost hypnotic in its tone and cadence. She smiled as she finished and it took the cold out of her face and replaced it with a radiant beauty. I could see why Powell had once said, 'Woe be to any man, standing without friend or protection in her presence. Many have been unmaned, sacrificing home, country, and fortune for one smile from that beautiful, cold face.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a moment my brain had frozen. As it thawed, I replied, "I give my word I shall abide by your request. Why would you wish to speak with me, your enemy?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dear Jekyll, I do not see you as the enemy. I desired a pleasant evening with dinner and conversation, between two civilized people. I wish to, as your newspapermen so delightfully put it, tell my side of the story. I chose you because you do not view my people with contempt and disdain. You seem willing to admit all people deserve decency. But please, first we shall dine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She rose gracefully, revealing herself to be a tall woman, with the dark skin of the Near East. She was dressed in the indecent garb of her lands. Her dress was a sheath of fine linen, bleached to absolute whiteness and thin enough that I could see the shadow of her form through it. It began below her breasts and extended almost to the floor. Two wide straps rose from it, covering her breasts, and tied behind her neck. Her feet were bare.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She conducted me into an ajoining chamber, set in a bay extending out from the home. It was surrounded in glass, giving vieew to the small garden benyond. I was served an excellent dinner, of many courses, based on the many delicacies of the East. She was ever the gracious hostess, engaging in small talk of literature, theatre, art, and various other topics. Once the after dinner brandy was served, she motioned for me to settle into a comfortable divan, which had appeared as dinner was cleared away. She took a seat in a simple chair facing me. "Now, to matters a bit more serious. Your 'friends' see me as an evil power, rising in the East, seeking to destroy or subjugate all of you. This is not the truth. I seek only to stop your unbridled expansion. Of course we are seen as the Eastern Menace. You come from a tiny section of the world and seek to bend us all to your will. There are more of us than you, and we take exception with this tactic. How is it your race has come to believe it is your right to subjugate the rest of us? What prompts this madness? And, before you state the manifest destiny of your 'god', remember, all of us have gods as well. They claim a difference of opinion with yours. How can you honestly believe you have the moral ground enslaving, destroying, and pillaging all you overrun?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stop us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. Confine you to this area you call 'Europe'. You leave us to our devices and we shall leave you to yours. You need to understand, you have no more right to conquest than any other race in history."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her words seeped into my thoughts, spreading a chilling uncertainty. Powell would have launched himself at her, Davies would have sought to arrest her, but all I could do was consider her words. Part of me wanted to believe she was pouring poison in my ear, but there was doubt as well. I had seen how native peoples were treated in India, when I was stationed there. I had seen the squallor of some parts of Cairo, the parts where the native peoples lived. "You seek to misdirect me. Powell says you seek to bring the world under you hand, to rule all as queen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her laughter was rich and genuine, showing her indescribable beauty once more. "There is no way to state this delicately. Dr. Jekyll, your 'friend' lies. I am many things, but one thing I will promise you, I will never lie to you. I might misdirect from time to time, but there will never be lies between us. Can you say the same for your friends? How many times has Powell appeared to be dead or Davies hidden an adventure from you, to 'protect' you? Might it be that they realize you are not a believer in the rightness of the white supremecy that they espouse? That you understand we are people, not servants and slaves, as they see?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have such weapons in my arsenal that should I desire to subjugate the world, it would be an easy task. Instead, I desire nothing more than to reach a balance, where you are constrained, just like everyone else. There can be harmony, or at least peace, between the peoples of the world. All it requires is an end to the desire for absolute dominance by all races." I drew breath to respond, but she held up a strong, yet shapely hand, "Do not respond now. I ask only that you consider my words. Let my people escort you home and think on what I have said. That is all I ask of you." She smiled that radiant smile again, "Although, I must also ask for your word that you will remain blindfolded until you are delivered to your door."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I agree," I answered reluctantly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then I thank you for a delightful evening. May you remain safe. Perhaps we may do this again." She gave me a slight bow and glided from the room. My eyes followed her perfect form as she moved away. Something had shifted in my mind and I no longer found her garb distressing or obscene.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dr., may we conduct you home?" I almost laughed at the absurdity of her heavily muscled brutes treating me with such courtesy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was still slightly confused when I walked into my rooms. Davies and Powell were there, Powell stalking around the room like a caged wild cat, while Davies sat in the large armchair, pipe going at full blast. "Where have you been, old man?" asked Davies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you forget you were going to autopsy the victim of last night's affairs?" Powell added. "We waited at the morgue for hours.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You must forgive me. I had a dinner invitation I could not refuse," I replied acidly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dinner was more important than our case?" Davies growled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When the invite comes from Nefersheshet herself, and is delivered by her usual servants, it is."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My god, man, are you alright?" Powell asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was granted safety for the evening, from all of her usual tricks." Something made me say cheerfully, "Dinner was superb and the company oddly charming." Powell turned grey and Davies stared hard at me, until I confessed pulling their legs, even though dinner had been quite enjoyable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What did you talk about?" Davies demanded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The theatre and art. Do you think she revealed her darkest plans to me, her enemy, over dinner?" Davies blunt questioning had started to annoy me, so I neglected to add any more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* another dinner - much later */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had just finished my last consultation when the messenger arrived. He asked my name, then handed me a heavy envelop, made of a yellow tinted material with visible bands of color in it. It took me a few moments to realize it was Egyptian papyrus instead of paper. My name and addresswere printed in purple ink, in a strong hand. "Sir, I've been asked to wait for a reply," the courier said as I accepted the letter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I turned it over, to break the seal, and saw hieroglyphics pressed into it. A chill chased up my spine as I began to suspect who had sent it. The envelop unfolded to reveal the message written on it, in the very old style. It was brief and curious.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">My dearest Dr. Jekyll,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I wish to say I have treasured our dinner appointments over the years. I realize they may have been less pleasant for you, given the circumstances of the invitations. I would like to try something different this time. I would like to extend an invitation for tomorrow night. The time and place to be deterined after your acceptance. I very much hope you will accept this invitiaton, however, there will be no forced invite should you decline. You may send your response with the courier who delivered thi invit.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I would ask, based on the odd pecadillios of our mutual aquaintances, that this invite be kept between the two of us. I guarantee your complete safety, as always. I fear I cannot afford to be as gracious to our mutual aquaintances, should they attempt to interfere.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I very much look forward to your reply.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">With love,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Nefersheshet</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stared for a long time at the short message, in her hand. I reached for writing materials, at first intending to decline, just to see if she would press the point, but reconsidered with pen in hand. I had enjoyed our encounters, after the initial shock of the mandatory invite. Putting pen to paper, I responded that I would be honored to meet her. It took moments to seal up my reply, tip the courier, and send him on his way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once he was gone, I sat in my best armchair and contemplated the state of my thoughts. She was the Devil Queen, the enemy of my race and the most dangerous woman in the world, yet our dinners together had been pleasant times of interesting conversation and great food. Most disturbing of all was the thoughts she prompted in me. She had me questioning everything about the British and European expansions into the rest of the world. I couldn't talk to Powell or Davies without rousing suspicions and concerns. There was no one else either. The friends I had from university and my time in the army held opinions at least as strong as those of Powell and Davies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was still struggling with my thoughts when Powell burst in, excaliming "Jekyll, quickly, we are on the trail of one of the devil queen's fiendish assistants!" I fought itrritation at his phrasing while rising to follow him out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* dinner */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Another papyrus note appeared the next morning, in the hands of a different courier.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Dearest Jekyll,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I regret the affairs which make it impossible tomeet at any of the better dining options in London. I must once again ask you to join me at a private residence.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Sadly, I must offer the usual travel arrangements, carriage and blindfold, to protect both of us. What time shall I have the driver call for you?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">With love,</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Nefersheshet</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took a few moments to set down my reply, asking for Egyptian fare and specifying at time of early evening. As I handed the reply to the courier, I realized I was actually looking forward to the event.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next day I made sure I was away from the surgery and anywhere else Powell and Davies would know to find me. I didn't want any interference with my plans.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the apointed time I stood in the shadows by St. Pancras station with a paper in my hand. A cab pulled up and one of the hulking men I usually saw with Nefersheshet stepped out. He gave a small smile and motioned toward the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stepped up into the enclosed cab, the door closed, and he pulled a hood from the seat mext to me. I looked at it and nodded slowly. He handed it to me and said, "Will you leave it in place or should I tie it down?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will leave it," I replied and I placed it over my head. It was clean and scented faintly with rose oil. It was a step up from the usual musty bags that had been used previously. Iheard him rap on the wall and the cab took off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Many twistings andturnings later we slowed to a stop. "Please leave it in place until we are inside. I will assist you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I understand," I replied. I was helped from the cab and carefully guided to a set of steps. A door was opened at the top and I was led in. Once the door closed I was told I could remove the hood. Soft candlelight greeted me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome Dr. Jekyll," the soothing tones of Nefersheshet greeted me. She was dressed in the simple, almost transparent, linen sheeth dress she usually wore. "I am glad you agreed to come. Would you care for a drink while dinner is being set out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lord Powell burst into the office of Inspector Davies. Powell was a tall, thin man, with nervous energy, skin bronzed by the Eastern sun, and lean, hawl-like features. The Inspector was as tall, but heavier, built like a brawler or a longshoreman. His face was pocked with scars from the pox as a child. His eyes were an intense blue and restlessly swept any room he was in. His hair had started to grey at the age of twenty and had gone completely white by this, his thirtieth year.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Davies, my good friend, it is good to see you again!" Powell exclaimed as he pumped Davies hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Powell, I had thought you were in Egypt. Wasn't there a dig, down the Nile from Cairo?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There was, up near Luxor, however, matters of great urgency have brought me home." Powell strode to the window, dropped the blinds, and dowsed the light.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What was that for?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I believe I am being followed. It started on the ship home, when I showed too much interest in several passengers of the lower classes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You are in London, now. The lawlessness of the colonies cannot threaten here, at the heart of the empire."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lord Powell burst into the office of Inspector Davies. Powell was a tall, thin man, with nervous energy, skin bronzed by the Eastern sun, and lean, hawl-like features. The Inspector was as tall, but heavier, built like a brawler or a longshoreman. His face was pocked with scars from the pox as a child.

<p class="regtxt5">Davies, my good friend, it is good to see you again!" Powell exclaimed as he pumped Davies hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Powell, I had thought you were in Egypt. Wasn't there a dig, down the Nile from Cairo?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There was, up near Luxor, however, matters of great urgency have brought me home." Powell strode to the window, dropped the blinds, and dowsed the light.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What was that for?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am interested in the tales of your travels, however, your message implied you had something of extreme importance to share with me," Davies responded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have you heard the news of the assassnation of the British Ambassador in Cairo?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It appeared in the papers this morning. I believe the dispatch came on the same ship as you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It did. I fear something else has come with us as well. The natives of Cairo believe there is a secret Egypt, ready to rise up and return to the rule of a barbaric 'god-king', a 'pharaoh' in their language."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My dear Powell, you have not been worried about this sort of tripe in the past. You know as well as I that the lower classes sometimes believe this nonsense to get through their miserable days. They could, of course, rise above this by embracing education and the help of their betters."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And I would not now, except for a strange conversation I heard at the consulate. Everything was disrupted by the murder when we were preparing our shipment. One of the functionaries let slip that the investigators were looking for an Egyptian woman, tall of stature, and imposing of carriage. I believe the same woman was on the ship home with us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Surely, many of that race look the same. How can you be certain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I cannot be certain. No one at the embassy had a good description. The woman on the ship was extremely memorable, however. Tall, lithe, with the dark skin of the Eastern. Her face was haughty, far in excess of her station. Sh"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Powell, this is all very interesting, but what is the urgent part of this series of events?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I believe this woman is here to kill the foriegn minister."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
