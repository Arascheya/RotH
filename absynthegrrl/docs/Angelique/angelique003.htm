<p class="pagecaption">Cleopatra VII: 69-30</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">New Concepts</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was with her in the end, having stayed, even after she declined my offer to bring Rome to its knees. Mark Anthony was watching his troops flee and she was mixing poison for herself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can still save this," I had said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let it go Mereret," had been her answer. When I made to continue she said, "I know you are immortal. I don't know how and I don't want to know. I may be a fool, but I am not a stupid one. How many inscriptions and texts show a Mereret as an advidor to the reigning Pharaoh? How many have you advised? The first record I was able to find were vague mentions in the time of Djoser of the third dynasty."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had sucked in a sharp breath. "I envy you and pity you. How many have you watched die in your years? How do you manage? Haven't you seen how we have fallen? Everything dies, Mereret. Let Egypt go. We have to change."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But the world I see is so ugly! Men rise to power, women become property, like unto the Greek and Roman way. Monotheistic religions rise and crush the spirit of all. I can turn this, keep the evil at bay."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can you? Do you see clearly or just parts? You are talking about world wide events. I don't think the gods themselves could forsee all possibilities. You have to let it go, like you let those around you go. Instead of trying to hold things back, try to change them. Fix the broken things where you can." It was too much. I fled from her, turbulent images spinning through my mind and nothing I could do would slow them. Under cover of night I took a boat up river and slept with my beloved Hatshepsut, heart-sick and tired beyond measure at the coming storm of ugliness the northern invaders would bring.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* should be more in line with actual events - revise as needed based on book and historical sources - Mereret is there when Cleopatra dies - need to refine how the last conversation goes, but Cleo should influence Mereret with regard to pro-active actions in changing times - it was a turbulent time */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* does Cleo need to invoke Ange, or is she already awake? Invocation would require a trip to Thebes and the Hatshepsut temple to awaken her. It would be interesting for there to be a procedur, but who would know it? Cleo is Ptolemy, who aren't exactly real Egyptians. This would make sense - Ange would tend to sleep more as her beloved Egypt shifted into other hands, first Greek, then Roman, and she would be hard pressed to endure many of the Ptolemys and their constant internal strife - Final decision - Cleo must awaken Ange, probably before her first contact with Julius Ceaser */</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Original Concepts</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cleopatra, now there was a pain in the ass as you would say. She wouldn't listen to anyone. Headstrong, will-full, and cunningly clueless, she refused any help from her advisors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Having watched the decline of my beloved Egypt at the hands of the Roman barbarians I had plotted long to stem the tides. In each generation of the Ptolemies I had watched the decline and tried to find ways to fight it. Every court had worthy and willing advisors, yet the ruler would have none of it. It was too risky they would always answer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Too risky, what a sad laugh. I, who had watched the rise and fall of countless dynasties, observed power and politics for centuries, I understood risk. These pampered pharaohs and their fawning sycophants understood nothing of power. Not a one of them had the stomach of a Hatshepsut or a Ramses.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At last, in Cleopatra's advisors, I found a body of men equal to the task. Yet she would have none of it. She felt she could use her powers and influence to turn the tide without resorting to the assassinations we knew would work. It would have been so easy. all I needed to do was get to Rome and within a night or two the empire would have been in chaos. She could have walked in, saved her beloved Caesar, the wanker, and been a hero. Instead she watched it all crumble under the Roman political machine. In the end she committed suicide rather than face the results of her folly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Heart-sick at this last defeat, I retreated to the ruined temple of Hatshepsut and slept for many centuries.</p>
