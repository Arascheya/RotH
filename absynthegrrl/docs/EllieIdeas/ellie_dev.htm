<p class="regtxt5">Mary is scary-sane most times, although, when she is in groups some of the old voices and images start to return. sometimes she has to just go walking, somewhere away from the crowd to let the voices quiet back down, other times it's enough to feel the old scars, from the years of cutting on herself</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Story Ellie and I had discussed was one where Mary and Angie travel to another group on the west coast. Group could include the motor cycle boy and others. In the end, they have a safe haven of people.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Ellie Ideas - raw</p>
<p class="regtxt5">absorbine jr (sorbie) - quite a bit older than the quints - named by mom, who was with the mexican circus filled mostly with indian performers most of whom were working without visas and were scared of the INS as a shoveler of elephant shit - she had worked with a better circus but lost her job because she was a drunk</p>
<p class="regtxt5">she fled the circus/carnival once her tits started to develop - she didn't want to have to fend off the other carnies</p>
<p class="regtxt5">quints - ennui, armoire, gascap, bidet, bobo, shadrack - off at a military academy on a stipend from their father's uncle. he died and the stipend was in the will since they were the only dependents. the quints are in seventh and eight grades - one flunked - some fetal alcohol problems - the one that's the huffer of the bunch - they are having trouble with their defence from romance teacher</p>
<p class="regtxt5">her mom hasn't been right since the mystic talked her into the trepanation - did make her like her job better, she always smelle like elephant sweat. mystic - was some fucked up person she met when the circus was on the reaod in Laurence Kansas - her mom hit the bible revival and the mystic all in the same weekend without catching the oddity of it</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* from mimf forum posts */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Let her find them herself. If she's anything like our quintuplets that we sent off to that Military Style insurance academy in Nebraska, she'll ignore any good advice you give her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It breaks my heart to think of Shadrach, Bobo, Ennui, Armoire, Bidet and little Gascap, and how we had to send them away when they developed an easy listening addiction. It was quite a disappointment to my mother and her Rockablilly-death metal Polka society and orchestra.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Asside from the quints, how's Absorbine Jr. these days?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Thanks for asking Jamie, but since little Sorbie ran away from the circus, we don't get much in the way of letters or calls. She's in our prayers, and we hope that she finds some happiness with her new beau, a geletain based life form she found at the bottom of a large tub of pudding at Wallmart when she was out buying a heavily discounted home trepanation kit with auto depth stop and scalp numbing patches.</p>
