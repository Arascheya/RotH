Kids these days. They're spoiled rotten. When I was a kid, after having to walk 49 miles through the snow to get a bowl of gruel for dinner, we'd all line up and depending on how much money the family had, we'd get a bedtime treat that was either a nice line of airplane glue under our noses, or a nice teddy bear soaked in ether. Then we'd drift away, safe in our beds knowing that we didn't really need to know what that grinding and dripping noise coming from the basement was, or why the coppery smell of blood and those muffled screams from the coal cellar were accompanied by the grunting of my dad's pet bear.
You need to toughen up that kid of yours, Steph. Or he'll never turn out as well balanced and as pleasant as our family did.
