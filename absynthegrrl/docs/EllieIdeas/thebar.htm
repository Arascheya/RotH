<p class="pagecaption">The Bar</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Music pulsing on the stage as rockers pogoed up and down around the stage. Red glitter flashed highlights in bright red hair under red lights while the group behind me chattered like monkeys in the zoo. A political volunteer raised her voice now and again, cajoling them to take phone shifts for the topic of the day. It became obvious they knew each other as she countered every excuse with her knowledge of their schedules.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Elsewhere small groups sat at shadowed tables and watched the antics on stage or shouted conversations to each other. The action at the bar was lazy but constant, allowing for introspection on the part of the bartenders. The large woman was wishing her shift would end soon. This was her second job and her feet hurt. Practice kept the friendly smile in place as she took orders and cleared away empties. The other bartender was still happy in his work. Every night he met old nd new friends, hung out where there was often music, and could sleep late, enjoy the sunny weather, and still make enough in wages and tips for his tiny apartment.</p>
