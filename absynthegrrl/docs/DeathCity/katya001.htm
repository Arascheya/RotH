<p class="pagecaption">Katya - Chapter 1</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She awoke in darkness, with the smell of dust heavy in the air. Faintly, in the distance, she heard noises and then a voice from much closer, "Petrov, there's no one here. Dispatch got it wrong this time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Keep looking. Dispatch has never been wrong about survivors," a deep voice shouted from the distance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something in it was familiar and reassuring and prompted her to struggle against the dark. She pulled her arms up in front of her and shoved against the weight pinning her down and shouted as she did, "Hey, I'm down here!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Petrov, over here!" The sounds of digging and scraping came from above her, releasing dust trickles into her face. Moments later a large piece of metal was hauled upward and off her. Light poured into her eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A huge hand touched her face and startled her eyes open. A bear of a man knelt above her, shading her eyes with his bulk, his massive right hand gently touching her face. "Kali?" his voice was hoarse and puzzled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who?" she asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sorry, your voice reminded me of someone I knew. Are you alright? Anything hurt or feel like anything is broken?" He asked as he pulled his hand away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think so," she tried to move. "My legs are pinned, but I think they're ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's get you out of there. Tom, get the lifting gear over here and someone call for Danny." He started pulling bit sof rubble away from her, taking in the shredded clothes and dust covered figure. Once the lifting gear was in place the heavy steel beam was lifted free of her legs. "Danny, can we move her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny asked the same questions of the girl, then replied, "I think you can move her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're going to lift you out now. Are you ready?" When she nodded Petrov and two others carefully lifted her out of the hole and set her on a nearby stretcher.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I can stand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It would be better if you took it slowly," Danny replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider - if she were to room with Tracy, what would happen if she found Kali's diary? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* scene with her, Merris, and Petrov after their first night together - could be sort of from Petrov's POV as he wakes with a blonde head and a black head nestled on him - Katya, dark hair, likes the right side, Merris, blonde, likes the left */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Petrocv wakes first - Merris second, Katya third */</p>
