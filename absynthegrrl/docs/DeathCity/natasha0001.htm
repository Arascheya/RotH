<p class="pagecaption">Natasha - Chapter 1</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Natasha opened her eyes to a crazy vision of girders, rubble and billowing dust. Slowly she dragged herself upright and stumbled toward a brightness in the cloud. Slowly she wondered why she could barely taste the dust. That moment of distraction caused her to trip over something soft and fall forward. A chunk of rebar scored a track down her arm. Even the pain was distant, more like a half remembered thing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At last she reached the brighter section and staggered out into a nightmare. Dark clouds of smoke billowed from the shattered reactor shell. Through the smoke the sun hung as a burnt orange ball. The buildings around her listed like drunken sailors, or sagged to the ground. Cars burned in the parking lot. Chunks of concrete, glass, and other things littered the fire blackened ground.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly she turned to look back at the control building. Her thoughts of other survivors died when she saw the pile of rubble where the building had stood. She looked for the opening she had emerged through and saw a tangle of wreckage she couldn't possibly have gotten through.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still dazed she began walking away from the building and toward the infirmary. A splash of color out of her left eye caught her attention. A brightly painted train stood on the siding where equipment would be delivered. Its paint and guilding sparkled in the reddish light. As she watched a woman leapt from the third engine. She ran straight toward Natasha. Shock kept her rooted in place as the woman came to a halt a couple of feet from her. "Oh goddess I'm sorry! I tried to get here sooner. You shouldn't have awoke alone!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Natasha stared at her, "What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please come with me. Let me take you someplace less...distressing..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali moved closer and gently took Natasha's arm. Natasha stared down at her hand but made no other move. Gently Kali pulled her toward the train. Natasha's eyes stared fixedly however she asked, "What is this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My train. I'll answer your questions once we are comfortable." Natasha slowed. "I mean you no harm. I promise you safety and the ability to leave at your will."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She directed her to her own car and helped her up the steps. Once Natasha was seated in the common room Kali asked, "Do you like coffee, tea, something else?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Natasha's eyes darted around taking in the surroundings /*add desc*/ "tea please." She continued as though waking slowly, "dark and long steeped with mint and lots of sugar if you have it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey boss, I'll get it." Ennui spoke from the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali gave a small start, "Don't do that!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sorry boss, can't help it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You aren't sorry at all and I know it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Busted. Tea coming up. usual for you?" Kali nodded. "Ok, I'll be right back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/*standard Death City intro fits here...for web releases maybe incorporate it into a seperate file that can be called from each*/</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I offer you choices. you may wait here for the guardian of whatever religion you worship to come for you, or you may accompany us to Eternia and board a sacred unit for your afterlife, or you can join the Death City Metro."</p>
