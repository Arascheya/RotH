<p class="pagecaption">Alice - Chapter 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They told me to ask Alice, so here I am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I knew who she was the instant I saw her. She wasn't as tall as I had expected, probably about five foot eight, maybe a bit shorter. Her face was angular, hard, and cold, more so than her friends would have described, even with the tangle of wavy dark red hair trying to soften the edges, and her grey eyes watched everything as she relaxed in the chair nearest the exit. "Kali? I knew you would come see me eventually. How may I assist you?" I asked as I walked into the admitting room from the office behind the desk.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alice? They told me to find Alice and ask her." Her lips twitched into a grimace or a smile, it was hard to be sure. "But you don't look ten feet tall."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm Alice, though only my mother calls me that. I've always been this height," I replied with a puzzled look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry," she said, her mouth widening into a real smile that touched her eyes, warmed her face, and made her beautiful. "The last was a reference to a song I really like, about a girl, a white rabbit, and some very strange adventures. You probably had to be there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It flashed into my head as I watched her. The song, a room with florescent graffiti, and a woman with a white rabbit tattoo. "Which pill was it, the red one or the blue one? The Lady won't abandon you and she won't make you go back. She does wish you would talk with her more, though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And how is she going to answer? Signs? Portents?" Kali asked with a twisted sneer over a flash of surprise.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No silly. She'll talk to you like we are talking. Now, what did you want me to look at?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Silently she pulled an ornate necklace out of her pocket and handed it over to me. It was heavy, cast tin plates were linked together with small chain pieces. Turquoise stones were set into it and the central piece had a thin sliced bit of amber, formed into a crescent moon set into it. Coins dangled from the front three plates on tiny chains, rustling and chiming as I turned the piece. A woman had worn this as she headed into battle. She had been excited, high from the thought of doing "god's work", then scared as she realized what she was doing. Her death was brutal, but fast, at the hands of a regretful Kali. "She was a sentient, not a demon, but a regular person, from a proxy world. They were tricked into battle by a godling of "light". It's true then, both sides are engaging now that the truce is broken."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had to kill her. She was coming after my team with an automatic weapon. I didn't want to, but I had to," Kali was close to tears, her voice breaking as she tried to explain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's alright, my daughter," the Lady's voice drifted into the room. "It will become much harder for you now, and for that I am very sorry."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why can't it just be demons?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The proxy godlings view their "followers" as tools, even though the followers created the proxy godling in the first place. The godlings will use them as throw away items to gain whatever advantage they can. Your team must be prepared for this nastiness."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* the lady should come into the room, looking suspiciously like Irena, and talk to Kali. She should explain the facts of the multi-verse, not from the perspective of the christian proxy, but the realities of it, the link of life and death, creation and destruction, the fact that everything in the multi-verse is in conflict over resources, from the smallest life form to the most lofty of ideals, all strive to consume or aquire more resources. In the true view of the multi-verse, killing is just another facet, one that changes the killer, but doesn't equal immediate damnation. Killing becomes evil when it is used without thought or understanding of the outcomes, or when it is motivated by purely selfish and greedy intentions. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* original start */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My name is Alice but only my mama calls me that. Everyone else calls me Ali. I am the go-to person in the Hall of Records. If someone needs an obscure bit of information, chances are I can find it. I have been here since, well, for a very long time. For many of us in Eternia time has lost its importance. When you know you are safe, have a place to stay, and food to eat, the pressures of day to day life evaporate and leave a peace that is never seen in the realms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A note for the new arrivals: Realms are the various places of existence that are outside of safe havens such as Eternia. I say safe havens even though no one has told me of any other haven besides Eternia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Most of us came here after death to heal and because the alternatives were too terrible to consider. While I was growing up my aunt always told me to 'get right with Jesus'. Now, I don't have anything against Jesus exactly, but the example my aunt and uncle portrayed seemed really at odds with the bits I got when I was dragged to church. My uncle knocked up my sixteen year old cousin when I was twelve. My aunt threw him out, but she wouldn't take my cousin Nita to the doctor. I tried to talk Nita into an abortion, or at least a trip to the doc, but my aunt had her convinced Jesus was enough to get by. By the time my aunt believed something was terribly wrong, it was too late. What little faith I had died with Nita. Maybe Jesus was real and maybe he wasn't, but it didn't matter if he didn't do anything. I figured my afterlife would be nothing or the hell of my aunt's beliefs. Instead, I landed here, in Eternia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I've been out on a few recovery missions, bringing the creations of various places and worlds back to Eternia, but mostly I stay in the Hall of Records, transcribing and organizing the data brought back from the various locales.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We knew almost as soon as the Truce was broken. I was working on notes from a recent mission when the Lady walked in. She called us together at the central table and told us where and how the truce had ended. She didn't seem as disturbed by it as I would have expected. "Ali, you are puzzled by my lack of reaction, aren't you?" I could only manage a nod. "This has happened before, and it will happen again. All of us must prepare for greater dangers when we are outside Eternia. Dispatch will be spreading the word. What I would like all of you to do is keep complete records of every event that occurs."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This was the first time I had seen the Lady. Many of my friends had stories about her appearing randomly around Eternia, but it was said to be a rare event. I want to say she looked the part of a goddess, but she actually looked like just another person, except for an aura of incredible power and a strange shimmer around her form.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider - first time seeing Kali could be to talk about the nature of the multi-verse and how the gods and such play into it */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have stared into the well of eternity and come back changed." I didn't mean it to sound as pretentious as it cam out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh great, mysticism and all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The truth of the multi-verse is this. There are three true powers, those older than time itself, and they do not need the worship, reverence, or notice of those that live short times. There are other entities with power, but they have come into being through the channeled energies of those that worship them or as random echoes in the void. These entities require the worship of their followers, otherwise they begin to fade away. They are the ones often called proxy gods because they squabble among themselves by using their worshippers as tools. Most are not worthy of any notice, however, most living need to believe in something and gravitate toward these things."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where is the Lady in all this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you not really know? The Lady is one of the three. As I can understand it, the three are Stability, Possibility, and Change. The Lady would be Change. Eternia exists as her homage to the various living races that have existed throughout time. That is why she has given us the task of preserving the beauty that has been created. She believes the temporal, those that live a short time, are deserving of notice for themselves and not through the godlings that prey upon them. You should talk to her about this directly though. The Lady does not support middle-men between herself and her associates and I will not be placed in such a position."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* try to explain what was learned at the Repository  - consider Alice to have gone there with Teresa and the Mystery Woman - at the whim of the Lady - there would be no necessary reason other than the Lady thought they could appreciate the place */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider - if use the Repository - Theresa and the Mystery Woman would take her on a return visit - Ali could dream of it as well */</p>
