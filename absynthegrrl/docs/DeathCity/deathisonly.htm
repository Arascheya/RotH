<p class="regtxt5">The knife was sharp and slid effortlessly through her flesh. The pain would be bright she knew, but it would take a moment, long enough to slice her other wrist as well. She focused her eyes on the precious statue she had stolen weeks ago. As she sank back into death her last sight was the image of the Goddess Kali in her awful glory.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">----------------------------------</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rebecca woke with a start. A chill chased its way down her spine and the echo of a shriek faded with the formless nightmare. Across the room her younger sister's breathing remained calm and steady.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">----------------------------------</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Annah woke to the sounds of birds. She blinked slowly, trying to remember why she was asleep outside. She couldn't seem to remember. She found she couldn't remember much of anything, her memory was a fuzzy blur. Slowly she stood and looked around the glade. It seemed familiar somehow. She walked toward an overgrown path</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When she reached the trees something stopped her. She could walk to the edge of the clearing and no farther. A small shard of panic flickered deep in the fog over her memory. She turned and walked to another section of trees and experienced the same barrier. The shards of panic flashed closer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned to return to where she had awoken and froze. In the center of the glade a body sprawled back, sightless eyes staring up at the sky. Curiosity pulled her forward and fear held her back. As she edged closer she began to make out the features. A crash of panic and terror ripped the clouds away as she recognized herself. An inhuman shriek tore through her throat and hurled itself skyward. Blackness swallowed her once more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">----------------------------------</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali jerked upright in bed. Her heart still pounding from the terror and despair in the scream that echoed in her ears. She leapt out of bed and darted from room to room, trying to locate the screamer. She found no one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her nerves were still raw as she lay wide awake wishing for sleep. At last she stood, slipped on some clothes, and stepped out onto the roof top. A running leap took her to the next one and she spent the rest of the night scrambling across the roof tops of Death City.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">----------------------------------</p>

<p class="regtxt5">INSERT glue logic here - build up to Kali out on her outside Eternia solo for locomotive driving</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali had finished the last part of the test, setting down on a target Realm and leaving again, when the com sounded. Merris voice came through onc she acknowledged. "Heya, I need you to pick someone up for me. I know you haven't been prepared for this, however, you're the only one close enough. This one shouldn't wake up alone." She finished up with the location of the pickup.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, if you're sure you want me to do this..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'll do fine. Just be yourself. Try and be reasuring and kind. Those seem to be the most important impressions to give to a new person." Kali changed tracks where Merris indicated and hurried over the tracks to the destination Realm. An hour later she was descending to the surface. The track was old and worn, running through an old and overgrown cutting. Moss clung to the steep slopes and ancient trees leaned close to the rails. Watery sunshine filtered through thin grey clouds scudding around overhead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali slowed the locomotive as she rounded a bend. There, to the right of the tracks, a white shape lay face down in the dead leaves and grass. Leafless trees kept silent vigil. Except for the sprawled shapelessness of the body the girl might have just been sleeping.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali eased the train to a stop and climbed down to the rail bed. Crumbling ballast and rotting sleepers revealed the desolation of this piece of track. A chill wind just stirred the dead grass. Carefully she approached the body and gently rolled it over.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sightless grey eyes stared up at the sky. "Oh gods!" Kali hissed at the gaping slash across the girl's throat. Breathing in gasps she tried to slow her wildly beating heart. Uncertain what to do next, she stood motionless for long moments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A strange shudder passed through the body as a faint white mist oozed from the open eyes. Slowly it swirled and clotted together until a shadow-rendering of the dead girl formed. With a soundless cry she threw herself at Kali. At first she was just a cold breath on Kali's skin. Gradually she solidified, her form pushing Kali's arms until she held a slowly warming form.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali held her close and stared into the distance, trying to ignore the hidious death wound on the girl's neck. Morbid fascination kept drawing her gaze back to it. Slowly it faded as the form solidified. When the girl started to shudder and cry silently Kali murmured reassurances until the worst of the shakes stopped. "I can take you away from here. Is that what you would want?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hold me, please just hold me. So cold." Kali kept her close and started to ease them away from the body. "Hands tearing at me. Pain, oh the pain, burning. First one, then another, and another, until I went numb. Why did they do that? Why!?" Her hands beat weakly against Kali's sides. "The knife, when it finally came, was a relief," she added in an empty voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have you. They can't hurt you any more." Kali murmured reassurances to the shivering girl.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't understand..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have you. You will be safe where we are going."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who are you? Where are we going? They killed me. Why am I still here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...I don't know. Maybe so I could come for you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're here. Now what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You get on the train with me and I take you out of here." Kali began leading the girl back toward the locomotive.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stopped as a voice spoke in her head, "Or you offer to let her go to the afterlife she believes in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali turned to the girl and added, "Actually, you have a choice. You may come with me or you may continue to the afterlife you believe in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know, I think I'll try your offer. I want no part of what I was taught to believe in. It..." she started to say more, stopped, mouth and turned toward the locomotive instead. She hesitated when she reached the ladder up to the cab. "Now what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Words again formed in Kali's mind, moving through her mouth of their own volition, "Come on aboard, and welcome to the Death City metro, Lady...?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Teresa...just Teresa for now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Welcome Lady Teresa."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">----------------------------------</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tracy looked up as a distant booming sound echoed through the passageway. Dust fell from the ceiling and the rock groaned. There was a distant crash followed by another, closer this time, bringing with it a billowing dust cloud.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A muted thump rattled the ground again as the lights cut out. Fumbling around Tracy found her flashlamp and turned it on. Thick dust still drifted in the now still air. Slowly it settled toward the ground. Overhead a thunderous boom knocked Tracy to the ground. A brief, sharp pain exploded in her head as darkness fell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">----------------------------------</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A distant voice called to Tracy. Slowly she pulled herself awake. A face wavered in the distance, as though seen through shifting gauze. Gradually it resolved into a sharp angled face. "Hello? Are you back yet?" the voice asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A distant throbbing pain faded rapidly as Tracy answered, "I think so. Ugh, feels like the ceiling caved in on me there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The woman gave her a strange look before replying, "It did."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wouldn't be alive to talk about it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You aren't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ahh...wait a minute..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm new at this, so I'm not sure what to say next. However, I will try and explain." The woman paused, closed her eyes for a moment and continued, "First, let me introduce myself. I am Kali."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali? You only have two arms, sorry."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled thinly. "That's a new one. I just have her name. I am not her. Anyway, I am Kali and I come from a place called Eternia. It's, well, it's an after-life of sorts, just not in the regular way. We don't care what faith you were, or if you had one at all. What matters is you have skills we would like. So here is the offer. You can return with me to Eternia and skip the regular after-life events, or you can go on to what ever you believe in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right," Tracy replied in a neutral voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't believe me..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What ever gave you that idea? How can I believe you? That's even more bizarre than the usual line."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"None the less, you may come with me, or wait for the after-life of choice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No fancy offers? No request for me to pledge my 'immortal soul'? You disappoint me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali laughed as she replied, "How melodramatic. No, just a plain offer. I would persuade you, however there are some down sides to the offer as well. If you die in the service of Eternia it is final. No reincarnation or anything like that. If you change your mind later and want to move on, you might be able to go to a regular after-life, however it really depends on the godling in charge. Some will let you in, some won't. We do offer a great place to live, a chance to do useful work in the preservation of knowledge and beauty, and a great bunch of people to hang with." Kali settled back on a chunk of ceiling, "You have a few minutes yet to decide. We usually like to be gone before the godlings' representatives arrive though. It's simpler that way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's say I believe you for a moment. What happens if I don't decide?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"To not decide is to decide. The afterlife you grew up believing in will come and claim you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe I should wait and negotiate, look for the best deal."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is no negotiation. Either you come with us or you go to what you believe. Our deal merely offers more options later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Eternian, you transgress." A formless grey shape slowly faded into existance in the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. This opportunity is sanctioned by the truce. I merely remain longer than usual."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The truce is broken. You interfere. The decision is made. Oblivion awaits."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We did not break it. I don't recall her deciding."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Be silent. She had her chance. Now I claim her for..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stop it! No, I have not decided," Tracy snarled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do not listen to the lies of this Eternian. They offer a continuation of pain and suffering. Their place is one of despair and abandonment. I give you the sweet silence of nothingness."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's up to her of course, but it seems we give options where you don't. Oblivion is always an option, even when in Eternia. You lose nothing by trying Eternia first."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do not interfere again, Eternian."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Seems like you have a point, Kali. I lose little by trying your option first. I choose Eternia. So, where do I sign? I imagine it will be in blood?" The half formed grey shape silently disolved back into the shadows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, nothing so elaborate. You just come with me to Eternia and we begin." Kali led the way back down the tunnel.  Tracy started as she spied one of her boots projecting from under a large piece of rubble. "Don't look. It's unsettling and never really seems to help at all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wouldn't knowing make it more final?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, but the seeing is always distressing. And you will notice that you still feel alive. Why subject yourself to the pain of it?" Tracy resolutely turned away and stared at Kali's back for the rest of the distance of the tunnel.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tracy, was there anything in there you were working on that you would like to continue with?" Kali asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, yes, there were several artifacts near where I was standing. They...they are probably burried with the remains..." She choked out the last words. "And could you get my equipment from my tent? There's a laptop and some peripherals that I am using. It has all my notes..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali turned to a small group of people waiting near the tunnel mouth. "Ok, we're finished in there. You may start recovery. Please be sure to grab the artifacts from under the cave-in in the center of the main chamber. There will be remains nearby as well, just so you know. Mishka, could you have someone grab Tracy's equipment?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A small thin russian looking man nodded. "Sure, where is it located? Are you sure it won't be missed?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should be ok. Dispatch says this entire place is being destroyed. How are we for time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"One hour remaining. The large statues will be close, however we're looking good with the rest of it." Mishka answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Count it down Mishka. I'll be with Tracy if you need anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tracy pointed a shaking finger at a tent set a small distance apart from the rest of the tents. "My stuff, it's in that tent. Why? What are you doing? What's going on? Count what down?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you," Mishka answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is what we do. We recover things of beauty before they are destroyed but after they won't be missed. To avoid detection or questions we gather items that are slated for destruction on the world of origin. Most of the time the entire world is in it's death throws, but sometimes, when we are sure of the outcome, we will go places and do spot recoveries. The items here are too beautiful to allow these ignorant religious freak wastes of skin to destroy. I wish we could take a more pro-active hand and prevent it in the first place, but that is not to be."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shouldn't you be tolerant as a member of the after-life?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, but since I don't have to be, I'm not. I've never cared what drivel someone wants to believe, as long as they didn't try to force it on another. Once they cross that line they should be hunted down and destroyed like mad dogs."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali drew in a long, shuddering breath, "I'm sorry. Religion is one of the few topics I can't rationally discuss. If you want to know how that aspect of Eternia works, you'll need to ask someone else."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aren't you working for something larger by being here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, but I don't have to kiss her ass to be here. I don't have to toady about, suck up, or tolerate abuse and turn the other cheek either. The Lady I know expects us to kick ass as needed and take names. She is mother and destroyer and so we can be as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see..." Tracy answered hesitantly. The she stopped and pointed at a short train pulled up on a section of track. "There's no train line here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You see before you a train of the Death City Metro. This is our transportation to Eternia. It's magic. Much more than that I can't explain just yet. I still don't understand either." There was a locomotive, an ornate circus baggage car, a fancy executive coach, several cargo wagons and three flatbed cars at the rear. A large statue was strapped to the first one. In the distance a mobile crane was lifting up a second one. Kali headed toward the rear platform of the executive car. "This car is usually assigned to a friend of mine. She let me use it to come for you. Come on aboard, and welcome to the Death City metro, Lady...?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tracy, Tracy Welch."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome Lady Tracy." The ritual completed Kali motioned to the side table and the steaming samovar on it. "There's jasmine tea if you'd like. There are stronger items in the cabinet below should you deisre. I have a few formal items to finish and then I can answer any questions you might have. It will be several hours before we arrive in Eternia." Kali grabbed the stack of papers on the table next to her and flipped through them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After several minutes she set them back down. "All finished. How are you doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Getting more feaked by the minute as I sit here. How did you know to be here? Why did you come? What're all those people doing out there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I knew to come because the Lady told us to be here. She selected you because of your skills at understanding things from the relics left behind. Since our task is to preserve beauty and history, your skills are quite important. The people outside are gathering up the items that will be destroyed in the next wave of attacks. No one will miss them because they would be destroyed anyway. This way we preserve them and no one misses them. This is what we do in Eternia."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tracy turned her head away from the window. She had been watching the ground recede in the distance. "I'd like to know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How that works? So would I."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That too, but I was really wondering wouldn't it have been easier to just blip out from ground level or something, rather than have to climb up out of the gravity well?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, I can't answer that one. It's something I wonder about as well. But this is how it works, and since it does..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">----------------------------------</p>

<p class="regtxt5">----------------------------------</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly she climbed the stairs back to her room. Still the ghost of the scream echoed. Sleep returned slowly and the rest of the night passed in disturbed dreams and half awake remembrances.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The warm morning sunshine finally chased the scream into the background of her mind. She had forgotten about it by the time she arrived at Temple Heath.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">INSERT - glue logic here - nightmares need to build more slowly, gradually interrupting her ability to function</p>

<p class="regtxt5">That night it woke her again and again she ran to Tracy's room. Tracy looked up from her computer as Kali dashed into the room. "Are you alright?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm fine. Just finishing off some thoughts on the latest recoveries. There were some fascinating pieces this time. Here, I can show you!" Tracy slid aside and motioned for Kali to look at the image on her screen. Tracy waited a few moments while Kali peered at the image and then asked, "So what's wrong? This is the second night you've come charging in here to check on me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought you were having nightmares again. I keep waking up to someone screaming my name. It hasn't seemed like part of any dream I was having at the time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I haven't had them in weeks now. And I haven't been screaming as far as I can tell."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">INSERT - glue logic here</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the middle of the night Kali's eyes shot open. She could still see the small glade and a leaf covered mound in its center. Again the shrieking voice howled her name in pain and despair. Sweat trickled down her back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stood on shaky legs and slowly made her way down to the kitchen. Her body went through the motions of making hot cocoa while her mind still dwelt in the glade. The first sip of cocoa helped calm her, bringing the realization she needed to ask someone about what the dreams meant.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her eyes drifted to the clock, it was one in the morning, the Cathouse would still be open. She ran upstairs, threw on a flight suit, and dashed out into the night. Swiftly she threaded her way through the sleeping town to the light and noise that was the Cathouse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She found Dementia at the main floor bar. Now that she was there she found it hard to ask what she had come for. She ordered a Morphine Drip, then stared into it for long minutes after it arrived.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You seem more quiet than usual. Is something wrong? You're not down dancing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, yeah, well...I think I'm going crazy. I'm getting weird dreams, almost constantly this last week. I can't figure out what any of it means, but I can't seem to sleep either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hang on, I'll find someone to cover and then we can talk. I'll meet you on the platform out back, sound good?" Kali nodded and slipped back out of the club. She walked around to the loading platform and settled onto an empty crate. A few minutes later Dementia joined her. "Now, tell me about what you're seeing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali quickly detailed what she had been experiencing for the past few weeks. Dementia listened silently until she was finished, then asked a few questions. "I'm sorry my friend, but you are getting visions. You might start by asking Merris. This seems more like the stuff she sometimes gets. It sounds like how she knows who I need to go recruit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">INSERT - glue logic here</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris stared as Kali came down the stairs from her bedroom. She was dressed in a long skirt of black crushed velvet, a black velvet vest over an emerald green silk shirt with puffed and pleated sleeves. High black button up boots, a dark purple bag, and a heavy black cape with purple lining completed the ensemble. She wore a large silver ankh suspended from a heavy silver chain. Hoop earrings with tiny skulls dangling from them peeked out from the riot of her red hair. Dark red lipstick outlined in black and heavy black eye makeup washed out her naturally healthy color. "Wow! You are so hot in that! I can hardly wait for your return."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali took a long shuddering breath, "You know, somehow this doesn't seem as good an idea as it did half an hour ago. I’m used to hiding by keeping to the shadows, not hiding by being out in the open."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Confidence issues?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very much so!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Remember, you've survived rescue missions, learned to drive steam engines, and are designing your own engine. if you can do that, you can play a goth girl in the Realms for a few days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have always heard hidden in plain sight. If they notice anything odd about me it will be the way I dress and move. With luck that will be all they notice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris moved to her, hugged her close and kissed her deeply. "It'll be fine. Are you still sure you can’t do this from here? Extractions from that world aren’t the easiest to arrange."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I’m sure, sadly they don’t have any of their documents or drawings online. All their site says is serious researchers only. I think I managed to get an interview, I just hope it’s enough to get access."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">It was midnight once more and he should have already been at work. Walking quickly Tom thought he heard a train whistle in the distance, but it couldn’t have been he told himself. No trains had come through town this late since he was a boy. With a shake of his head he turned down a side street a couple of blocks before the train station. In recent years the station had been renovated into an Amirtrak station. It was better than being torn down, but the efficient, modern design was awful compared to what it had been before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tom didn’t see the shadow of an old steam locomotive pull up to the platform. A figure stepped lightly from the single coach. Half turning she said, "I'll send a message when it is time to pick me up. This is one of the places with an extensive railroad documents collection."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fear hit her as she stepped from the train. She was back in the Realms with no one to watch her back. Nervously she pulled the dark cloak closer around herself. Once again she wondered why she hadn't just gone with her old Realms attire of floppy top and baggy pants.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Moving quietly the figure slipped away from the train and around the closed building. She hugged the shadows as she headed down the street following half remembered directions to the hotel she had selected. She turned down the same street Tom had gone down just minutes before. Up ahead was the Cleveland Hotel where she planned to find rooms. It was only three blocks from the State Centeral Archives where she hoped to find the data she needed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tom had just relieved the previous front desk person when the street door opened and a woman walked in. At first he only glanced up to see if it might be a customer, then he looked again and stared as she registered on him. Goth would be the best way to describe her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her fear turned to terror as the young man behind the desk stared at her. 'Hidden in plain sight my ass. What the FUCK was I thinking?' she screamed at herself. Anger followed quickly. Anger that this Realm could still bring such terror. The anger gave her the bravado to speak in a low rich voice, "Good evening good sir. Might you have a room available for one such as I this fine night?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yes, yes we do," Blood flooded his cheeks as he stammered, "I'm..I'm sorry for staring." He looked down at the register, trying to cover his embarrasment by getting a pen. His embarrasment further eased the churning fear and anger. "We don't, that is I, I'm sorry, we don't see many non-business people here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her boots scarcely made a sound as she seemed to glide over to the desk. She set down a carpet style bag done in dusty rose patterns. "I should like to reserve the best you have for three nights. How much will you require for this boon?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This boon, um, the room is one hundred fifty dollars a night." She flipped her cape back, reached into a dark purple velvet bag, and drew out a small group of bills held together with a spider web money clip. She pulled the amount from the wad and set them on the counter. "We prefer credit cards for payment." He shrugged apologetically, "Company policy I’m afraid, sorry..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am too," she replied as she allowed him a glance at the wad still in the clip. Then she picked up the money and turned to go. "I had heard this was a good place to stay while in town. Might you recommend some place where the rules aren’t quite so rigid?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, well..." She could hear the indecision in his tone. Turning slowly, making sure he was watching, she walked slowly toward the door. Just as she reached it he made up his mind. "Um, it’s ok. You can stay here. Just please don’t let my manager know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She sketched a slight curtsey his way and replied, "Thank you good sir." Silently she returned to the counter and once more laid out the money. This time there was a sizeable extra amount accidentally left in the stack. She waved it away carelessly when he tried to return it. "Now, if you could recommend a good place to find refreshment my evening would be complete."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I’d offer you the room service menu but we’ve been closing the kitchen between 10 and 6 in the morning. There’s not much open this time of day other than some of the sports bars." He nodded at her slightly curled lip. "Yeah, I know, not everyone is into that. There’s an all night food chain place eight blocks from here, but it won’t be very good." While he talked he pulled out a key from under the desk and set it on the counter. "I put you in the presidential suite. It’s said one of the presidents actually stayed here during his campaign. If you could just fill in this guest card please."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She scanned it and wrote in the data she had created for the purpose. "Duluth huh?" He asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, the lake is wicked. The scene is ok, but nothing like I hear Seattle is."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I’d love to go to Seattle. Join a band maybe... But it won’t happen with what I make here. If there’s anything you need, don’t hesitate to ring. You have a good night, Nanaja. Did I pronounce it right?," he said, glancing at her name on the card.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Perfectly," Kali smiled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cool! How'd you end up with such an interesting name?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My mom was kind of a new age freak. She picked it out and my father couldn't have cared less."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's pretty. I like it. Does it mean something then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think it's an ancient goddess from Summeria, or some place like that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, sure beats plain old Tom for coolness factor. Would you like me to show you where the room is?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I think I can find it, thanks. You could tell me how to find the state archive building though. I'm headed there for some research tomorrow. Family history kinds of things for my mom, kind of a birthday gift."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, neat! It's really easy." He quickly narrated the way. In a few moments she was in the elevator headed for the top floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The shakes hit as soon as the elevator door closed. "Fuck, fuck, fuck," she mumbled to herself as her hands clutched the hand rails. She finished most of the ride tucked into a corner of the elevator.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She twitched when the doors slid open and then darted down the hall to her room. Inside she pressed hands to her head and staggered through the sitting room to the bed where she collapsed in a heap. She sucked in deep breaths, trying to stop the pounding of her heart and the terror chasing around her nerves.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When they settled somewhat she pulled herself up and headed to the bathroom, muttering to herself as she went, "Now what's this all about? Everything went fine. Gods, I forgot how much this Realm freaks me." She splashed cold water on her face and went back to the bed. She slipped out of her clothes and lay back staring at the ceiling.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sleep came slowly and when it did the dreams started again. This time there was more and the images were even stronger. It was night and the woman was nervous. She slipped through the trees listening for sounds of pursuit. When she reached the moonlit glade she opened the dirty and creased plastic bag. Fear dominated her thoughts as she reached into the bag. The dream faded slowly as Kali hauled herself awake. It recurred every time she drifted to sleep.</p>

</br>
<p class="regtxt5"> She finally gave up trying at five in the morning. At six she called room service for coffee and food. Once she was done she showered and dressed in the business casual she had brought. While she waited for business hours to arrive she reviewed her notes and paced her suite.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Feeling completely alien in the unfamiliar garments she left her rooms. Fear hit her as soon as she hit the lobby and wasn't helped by Tom calling out to her, "My shift just ended. How was your night? Sleep ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, as well as I ever do first night in a new place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He looked her up and down in what he thought was a discreet way. Kali was surprised that it charmed her almost as much as it annoyed her. "You look different..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Office drag. Gotta look appropriate for the suits at the archives. They can easily deny me access. So do you." He had traded his front desk wear for faded jeans and a shirt with an AmirTrak logo plastered on the front.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I'm off to sweep out the AmirTrak station, sell a few tickets, then to classes. Some time this afternoon I get to sleep a little before starting it all over again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tom had been correct. It only took her ten minutes to arrive at the archive building. She gave her name and appointment time at the desk and took a chair to wait.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Right on time a stoop shouldered older man came out of a back office and called, "Nanaja Carlen? I am Victor Huber, chief supervisor of the archives."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She extended her hand to him as she replied, "Pleased to meet you Mr. Huber." He looked surprised when he saw her earings with the skulls and the bone rings adorning her fingers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I understand you are looking for Baldwin engineering drawings. Is that correct?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes it is."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And who are you representing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Lake Superior Railroad Museum. You already helped us out with several drawings in the past."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That was for a Mallet wasn't it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes it was. I'm surprised you remembered."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"All part of the job. And what would you like assistance with this time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are working on another one of the same series. Unfortunately this one is in much worse shape. We are hoping to find engineering documents on the boiler materials and assembly. Also the iron and steel specifications for the cylinders, pistons and cranks. We could take samples from existing stock, but original data would be better for our exhibits."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am terribly sorry to have wasted your time Ms. Carlen. I could have saved you a trip if your offices had been more specific about what you were seeking. The engineering and Baldwin works data has been moved to the Railroad Museum of Pensylvaya in Strausbourg. I can call ahead and get you permission to visit there of course. But I must tell you much of the materials data you are asking about was maintained by the suppliers and was not archived here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And I appologize for taking your time as well. I would appreciate it if you could call Strasbourg though. I'd still like to take a look at what is available."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">"Nanaja, hey. What brings you here?" Tom asked when she approached the AmirTrak ticket window.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I just found out the records I was looking for were moved to some place called Strausbourg. Apparently there is a rail museum there where most of the railroad documents now reside."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is indeed! It's one of my favorite haunts. You can't get there by train though. The stupid government keeps cutting funding for AmirTrak and the destinations available. Then they wonder why we keep losing money. I can get you to Lancaster. You can rent a car there. It's only twenty or thirty minutes to the museum from the Lancaster station.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">INSERT - glue logic here</p>

<p class="regtxt5">GLUE LOGIC - need to write  scene or two of Kali and a market place girl in the Strasbourg area asking her about the outside world - probably prompted by her appearance. Kali rents a bicycle in Lancaster and uses that for transport</p>

<p class="regtxt5">INSERT - glue logic here</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The girl from the market stand ran up as Kali unlocked her bike. "Please, I know you aren't from around here. Help me get out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't really help. I'm just another stranger here I can't very well take you with me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't stay here. This place is killing me. I don't think I can make it another year and I don't have enough money to leave."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I still don't think I can help you. What would you do if you came with me? You still wouldn't have any money."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know you aren't from this Realm. What do people do where you came from?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stared at the girl for long moments before slowly replying, "I think you have me confused with some fantasy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Lady told me to wait for you. She told me you can take me on the train when it comes for you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali froze, then said slowly, "Who?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Lady, a woman dressed all in black, appeared to me in dreams and told me a messenger would come. She would help me leave."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not leaving for a few days yet." Kali mounted her bike. "I'll see you tomorrow on my way through." She turned and rode toward her inn.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In her room she shrugged off her clothes and headed for the jacuzzi. Within moments she had settled into the churning water. Tension slowly oozed out of her back and neck. The throbbing headache faded soon after. Refreshed, she dried off, slipped into a large floppy shirt and harem pants, prepared a large glass of absinth and settled into a chair on her deck.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sleep slipped up on her like a velvet club. Moments later she was standing in the pattern. "Welcome Daughter."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mom." Kali replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have met a girl whom I wish to recruit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. But that seems mostly settled, except for a few details..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know. We don't need to talk about her. There is another issue though. I sense turmoil in you, daughter."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is the matter of the ghost woman screaming your name every night in my dreams."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your name. How do you like the price of taking my name for yourself? Who'd have thought it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sarcasm from you, mom?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And there's no sarcasm in you calling me mom? Ah well, no matter. In the case of the woman though, she is a suicide. Merris will be contacting you when you leave here with the details I am sharing now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, she's a suicide, so how do I stop her from shrieking in my dreams every night?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Normally we would recruit her or give her the chance to move on."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, shall I stop on the way back from here or will someone else handle it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No and no. It wouldn't be proper for us to interfere."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Proper? I have to put up with this because it wouldn't be proper? I don't think so..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Daughter..." The Lady said with a warning tone. "Don't presume to take that tone with me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh? So you condem your daughter to suffer as well?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, of course not. It's just she's a suicide, and I can't condone that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Offering them a chance at some form of healing and redemption is too much? I thought you played by your own rules. Since when have you cared what the godlings think about anything?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not that I am playing by their rules. Suicides are unstable, That's why they committed it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So instability is enough to condemn her? I thought you didn't play that way?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't typically. The instability is dangerous though. I don't want that sort of instability in Eternia."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And how are they different from Walkers? Walkers deliberately choose to leave the Realms for Eternia. And there are many in Eternia that consider us unstable and dangerous. The only difference I see is I didn't kill myself before I stepped out of the Realms."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Suicides have given up. How could you be sure they wouldn't give up on a mission?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I couldn't. Maybe they have given up, but I think it is more complicated than that. Every religion says we make our own destiny, but how is that true? By trying to make my destiny I am colliding with others doing the same. Things get broken, options get removed, and somebody gets hurt. What happens when all the doors are closed? Why not opt out and go for another cycle of the wheel? Why stick through it for the nebulous 'growth'? Sure, a suicide could give up on an Eternia mission in the middle, but so could anyone else. Anyone could walk off into the wreckage and just stop. Or return to the Realms or end themselves. When the tram came for me I was ready to give up. Yet I seem to be doing ok here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You didn't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, but it was always in the top 5 options, often hovering at 2. What is the difference really between active and passive suicide? If a car had hit me that night I would not have fought for life. Sometimes it's about escaping pain, sometimes about escaping dead ends, who can say? If the tram hadn't come I don't know when I would have stopped taking care of myself, but I know it would happen. I never wanted to be in that Realm and it was getting harder every day to find reasons to stay."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I still don't like the thought..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You must have some ambivalence, otherwise you wouldn't be talking to me about it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Lady laughed as she replied, "Yes. I could just Say and you would be bound, but, what is it you always say? Where's the fun in that? What if you take a suicide and they leave at a critical point?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then we agree they hold non-critical places until they repeatedly demonstrate they will stay, even through the terrible stuff."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok then, you have my permission."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why thank you Great Lady."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Lady laughed warmly, "Sarcasm becomes you so well, upstart."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled in return and sketched a shallow bow, "Thank you, mom."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">INSERT - glue logic here</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The com sounded as they cleared the atmosphere. "Kali, Merris just called, she found your mystery screamer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She did? What's the what Allen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She is the ghost of a woman not far from where you are now. Seems she fixated on Kali at the time of her death. Now her spirit continues the call."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Has she set us a course there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, the woman was a suicide. Policy prevents our interference."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is Merris still on the dispatch channel? I'd like to talk to her for a minute."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here she is."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Allen pushed a button and Merris joined the conversation. "Heya babe, how was your trip?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good so far. Looking forward to getting back though. Although I think I should make one last stop."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Policy..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, could you check with your sources about that again? A large dark voice whispered in my ear the other night. She said something about a special case..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wish I had your connections."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No you don't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're right, no I don't. Just a moment." Kali waited while Merris left the com for long minutes. At last she returned. "Allen, I'm giving you a routing to the target location. Seems Kali's connections have plans for this suicide."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok Merris. Kali, looks like two hours until we arrive. It's not far from here but we need to dodge some Realms traffic."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks Allen. See you soon, dear one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah. I hope you know what you are doing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Me too," Kali sighed and turned off the com. She turned back to Rebecca. "How much did The Lady show you in your dreams?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She explained the this place, this Eternia, is outside the normal scheme of things. She said her representative would explain the details."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, I can explain it, however I need to pick up someone else before we leave. I can explain it to both of you then."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">INSERT - glue logic here</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Allen brought the train around another bend while Kali scanned the forest beside the old tracks. Suddenly she pointed to the right, "There it is. That tiny glade up ahead."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Allen slowed the train, bringing it to a perfect stop right at the glade. Ahead rusty tracks continued around another bend. To the left and overhead giant maples raised skeletal fingers to the watery golden fall light. Multi-colored leaves formed piles against the rails and nearby trees.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A flash of white drew Kali's glance. In the center of the glade a pale shadow of a woman crouched near a large leaf pile and brushed futilely at a smaller pile. She jumped up, raised fists to the sky, then kicked a ghostly foot through the smaller mound. Then she dropped back into a crouch and stared mournfully at the larger pile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali quietly climbed down from the cab and slowly approached the huddled figure. The woman leapt back as Kali's thin shadow fell on the small mound. "Clear leaves, can't see the goddess. Must clear the leaves." A faint voice, barely louder than a breeze sighed out of the woman as she bent again to paw at the smaller mound.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali bent and brushed the leaves away. Her eyes opened wide in surprise as she beheld a faded ceramic figure of the goddess Kali. It might once have been identical to the one she had kept in the Realms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, thank you dear friend," the voice was a bit stronger as the woman looked up to see her benefactor. "Thank... Oh, you've come! Goddess, bless you, you've come. Great One I prayed for you, every day I have prayed for you. At last you are here but I am not. A ghost, just a ghost. I couldn't, you see... I just couldn't stay. But then after I tried, I couldn't go either. I've stayed waiting, waiting, and now..." She held her arms up in supplication and Kali noticed the red tracks of the cuts on her wrists.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali reached for her and waited as the spirit slowly solidified. The she gently took the woman's hands. "I am not the one you think. I am not a goddess. I have come to help you move on."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where am I to go? I was waiting for an ending, a resting from awareness. An escape, an escape... Instead here I have been watching the leaves fall and the squirrels run. What does it all mean, goddess?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That you must choose..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I did choose," the woman interrupted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You were to be given a choice. That choice was placed on hold when you killed yourself. By rights you should have forfeited it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you interceded for me, didn't you? I saw you. At the very last my eyes saw you, not the statue. I know that you are her. What you believe is not important, for we know, those that are dead but not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do not mock The Lady with your craziness. She gave you a chance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She calls you daughter. She would deny you nothing. I heard a voice on the wind, a voice that told me to wait for you. For the vision woman to come for me." Kali backed away at the words. She shook her head and opened her mouth to refute the woman again. "What is my choice, my salvation?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali started to speak, stopped, then started again, "The choice is to come with me or go on to the oblivion you sought."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oblivi.. uh..." the woman's voice trailed off to silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought so. If you had truly wanted oblivion, you would have received it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And where would you take me, goddess?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stop the goddess crap, ok? If you want me to help you call me Kali, or hey you, or anything except goddess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, go...Kali..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's better, thank you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want some place where what I do isn't tedious, dead end, mean nothing, bullshit. I want to be of some use. I want a place where I am not property, not an ornament, but where I matter because I exist. Please, take me away from here. I have hated it here since I was old enough to be aware."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I invite you into Eternia, lady?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Annah, Annah Kovachi."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lady Annah, welcome to Eternia and the Death City Metro. You bear upon you a singular honor and burden. You are the first of your kind that The Lady has permitted access. The ways in which you adapt and behave will determine if any other suicides are allowed entry. I expect you to bring honor to your kind."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will not fail you Lady Kali. I thank you for your intercession and pray you will strengthen and guide me in the ways of Eternia and my new life."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali opened her mouth, snapped it shut again, whirled, and walked stiffly to the train. When she saw Annah hesitating behind her she waved sharply and called, "Well, get a move on it." Allen snickered as she passed him. "Shut up, you! And get us the fuck out of here." she hissed in way of answer. "If I'd known this was the what of it I'd have lived with the fucking nightmares."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hearing is obedience, oh goddess. May your wrath not smite me before I have driven us home." His words pulled a short, sharp laugh from Kali as she continued past him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali rapidly climbed the stairs to the company car, opened the door, and threw herself into a nearby lounge chair. She motioned Annah to sit as well. "There's jasmine tea in the samovar on the counter if you want it." She turned to Rebecca and said, "Rebecca, this is...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Annah, oh my god, is that you? What happened? I've missed you so much. No one would tell me what happened to you or where you were."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Annah turned even more pale. "Rebecca? Oh god no. Goddess, please tell me she isn't dead. I never would have left. Did you take your life too?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Annah, what are you saying? You didn't, please say you didn't. Not that, not suicide!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I.. Jacob.. I couldn't...I...oh Becca, I couldn't stay. I couldn't. Better oblivion or damnation than another day as his slave-wife."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Becca, you know I didn't believe, just like you didn't." Annah gave a ghost of a laugh. "And it looks like we were right, doesn't it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I got out. You could have..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No Becca. Jacob found my pills. You know, the ones you helped me get from the public health doctor. He flushed them, then took the strap to me. After that either Essau or Jacob was always around. I still don't know how I managed to slip out that night two months ago." Annah looked thoughtful for a moment, "Remember that statue we found, in that strange little shop in Lancaster? I knew she was real. And she came for me. She didn't condemn me like that petulant father god Jacob worships. Maybe she helped me get away." Annah looked at Kali, "Did you help me, go.. Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, wasn't that the name of that goddess you bought? I thought that name was familiar somehow..." Rebecca asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's just my name," Kali answered swiftly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes it was," Annah said as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali held up her hand, "Rebecca, don't let Annah get you started. I am just the woman that helped you out. I am no goddess. So stop with the hero worship. I am just a woman like  the two of you. I don't want or deserve your adoration. Annah, if you keep it up I'll kick your sorry ass off the back of this train and let you find oblivion right now. You are really annoying me and you can ask the nice driver of this train how unpleasant I can be." As if on cue the train began to move, slowly at first, then rapidly picking up speed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have read up on you. I know that you are Mother and Destroyer, Giver and Taker..." Annah began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"STOP! Right now. Either you treat me as any other person or this experiment ends now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Experiment? Is that all I am to you?" Annah asked with some force. "You call yourself by a goddess name and deny your attachment? You call me experiment. Does that mean you have the power to end me? Does that not make you what I have called you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it does not. But I like the fire in you. It's better than fawning sycophant."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Experiment?" Rebecca echoed. "My cousin better not be an experiment. She has had a mostly terrible life. She doesn't deserve any more shit!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rebecca, normally a person who does what your cousin did is not allowed entry. She is the first to be given this chance. That is how she is an experiment. Honored person would be a better term for it, I admit. Please accept my appologies for a poor turn of phrase."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You promised me a description of what Eternia is. When does that happen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">INSERT - description of Eternia</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, stay with the fire. It will suit you better here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What am I supposed to do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Find something you want to do and do it. We aren't here to tell you what to do. That's up to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outside the windows the sky had turned black as the train had climbed away from the surface. Annah glanced and the stared, finally whispering, "The stars are so beautiful! Thank you go... Thank you for coming for me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's one of the things I do. We have about thirty minutes until we reach the Portal. That's even more impressive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They sat quietly until Kali mentioned, "Look out over here. We are coming in from the side of the Portal." Annah crossed to the windows near Kali. Ahead and to the side she saw an immense shimmering disk. Color and nothingness danced across its swirling depths. "Don't stare at it too long. It can drive you mad." Annah remained transfixed as the train turned and entered the Portal. Twisting silent shrieking pleasure cascaded through Kali draining away the tension she always felt outside Eternia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Annah's eyes were closed and her face held an expression of complete peace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They rolled past Portal Station and headed directly for the route down. Late afternoon sunlight filtered into the narrow valley around the station. Ahead yawned the dark mouths of the first tunnels.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I came from a place where the dominant lie was all are equal. Well, it didn't take many years to know that wasn't true. You were more equal if you had money. You were more equal if your family was known as powerful. The rest of us sucked up the lie and acted as if we were part of that small group of privilege. Democracy, what a sham. It really means rule of the stupid by the stupid. Popular vote descends rapidly into madness with the lowest common denominator calling the shots. It works ok if you are part of the majority, but if you aren't, there aren't many protections built in. Yet any other system is easily as bad without even a chance of change without blood."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's part of what brought me to this. I was so tired of paying the price for stupid decisions made by other people. So I decided to pay the price for my own inability to see a way out. That was why my hope for oblivion, I guess. I just wanted an end to it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I understand," replied Kali. "I came from a similar place."</p>
