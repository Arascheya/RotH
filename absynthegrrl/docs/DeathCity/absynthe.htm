<p class="pagecaption">Let Us Drink Absynthe Together</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris fidgeted uneasily as they sat in the cushions of the tower room watching the shadows lengthen on the cathedral. Finally she spoke quietly and in a rush. "There is something I would like you to join me in. tonight is my birthday and I usually celebrate with absynthe at this small place I know. It’s not for everyone and I won’t be offended if you don’t want to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Absynthe? What’s it like? I’ve never tried it, although I’ve seen mention of it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It’s different for everyone. For me it is relaxing and disconnecting, kind of like a combination of good alcohol and good marijuana. Others say different things..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I’d love to!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was dusk as they threaded their way through the streets down an alley and up the stairs to a polished oak door. Merris reached out and opened it, passing into the warm light beyond.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The main room was small holding only five small tables and a larger one for groups. Four alcoves hid behind gauzy drapes. Two looked out over the alley they had just come down, the other two looked over the river turning from reddish silver into black as the sun faded from the sky. As they entered a youngish man came out from behind another curtain. Kali stopped and grinned, "Erick, good to see you again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, how’ve you been? Any more excitement?" He motioned them in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not as much as when we first met, no. I’m learning to drive trains though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Merris, so good to see you again! Is it that time again so soon?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you Erick. Yes it is. A window if you have one please." Kali quickly scanned the alcoves noticing shapes in two of them as Erick led them to the farthest window. With a flourish he parted the curtain and motioned them to the small table covered with a yellowed lace cloth. The chairs were ornate and faded, looking like they would have been more at home in a French mansion rather than a small public house. Warily Kali eased into one, expecting the usual discomfort of many fancy furniture pieces. Instead the chair enfolded her, cradling her gently. With a contented sigh she leaned back as Merris settled in across from her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With another flourish Erick leaned in and lit the single candle that was resting in a climbing rose shaped wrought iron holder. He turned to Merris. "The usual?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a brief moment she hesitated then nodded, "Yes, that would be delightful."  She turned to Kali as Erick moved away, "You know Erick?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We met on that first mission of mine. He was one of the people we rescued. The usual? How often have you been here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then I have even more to thank you for. The usual is absynthe and Bull’s Blood with the water and sugar served separately. Some just drink the absynthe already mixed but I find the ritual of mixing it as much a part of the enjoyment as the actual consumption. I’ve come here every birthday since I arrived. It’s been a few years now. Have you heard much about absynthe?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Not much, just the little bits on various goth web sites."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Absynthe in its raw form is very bitter and usually very high in alcohol, at least the way Erick has it made. There are other ways of making it but I have heard they tend to be far more toxic. Anyway, the ceremony is to place about a shot of absynthe in a glass, suspend sugar over it, and dissolve the sugar with water until the resulting mixture is chartreuse green. Then you taste it. If you want it sweeter, add more water through the sugar. I must warn you it is an acquired taste. Also it will make you very thirsty. Drink plenty of water otherwise tomorrow morning will not be much fun.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Erick returned with a tray and set out two goblets of a blood red wine, two large glasses of water, two empty ornate glasses, a decanter of emerald green liquid, another of iced water, a small bowl of lump sugar, tongs, and two spoons shaped to resemble skeletal hands grasping spider webs. Kali mimed Merris as she prepared the absynthe. The first sip was not as unpleasant as she had feared. There was a tangy citrus flavor, almost grapefruit in nature, followed by a slightly bitter after-taste. She found that sipping slowly and sipping water helped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They talked as the night advanced. Kali prepared a second glass for herself without hesitation when Merris refilled hers. The sound of the water splashing softly into the absynthe mixed with the gentle flickering of the candle slid her into a trance-like state. She found her thoughts floating between the room, the moon silvered river outside, and the mountains surrounding the Portal. The sounds of the absynthe flowing over her teeth sounded just like the stream behind Portal Station.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Through the chartreuse liquid she caught glimpses of a coal black engine with a leaping snow leopard on its flanks. Images cascaded through her mind. Titanic magics crashing into each other on a thousand different worlds, civilizations crumbling, old before earth even formed, the birth and death of suns, and the faint image of a multi-armed goddess holding out weapons of destruction, scrolls of learning, herbs of healing, and tools of building. Behind everything hung a faintly glimmering pattern, woven of starlight. Looking into the main room she saw pulses of energy swirling against each other, ebbing and flowing in a tangled dance of connections and separation. Closing her eyes she let peace wash over her. The only peace she had felt in years.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At last Erick came to their alcove. "I must be closing soon I fear." Merris smiled at him and silently handed him double her usual fee, rare chocolates from several realms beyond the Portal. "Thank you my friend. I shall see you again next year. Kali, I hope to see you again as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali slowly returned to the room from the far away place where she had been. Looking around she saw they were the last ones left besides Erick. She smiled at him, "I surely shall return. Thank you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly Merris and Kali made their way to the street and slipped through the streets toward Kali’s building. For once the surrounding people didn’t inspire terror in Kali's heart. The absynthe cushioned her and altered her vision. If she didn’t try to see she saw tendrils of light binding those around her to each other and to her. The cold knot of fear that had been with her for as long as she could remember began to thaw.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mid way across the river bridge Kali turned to Merris and gently touched her cheek. "You are so beautiful," she quietly said. Calmly she waited for Merris’ reaction, prepared for whatever it might be. Without a word Merris leaned forward and softly kissed her. Kali linked her arm with Merris as they moved off the bridge and toward Kali’s building.</p>
