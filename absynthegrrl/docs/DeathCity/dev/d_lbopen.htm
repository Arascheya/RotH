<p class="pagecaption"><a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/loves_bitch.htm">Love's Bitch</a> - Typical Show Opening</p>
<p class="regtxt5">wolf howls behind a dark stage, once the theatre organ is online - the opening of Bach's Tocata and Fugue in D Minor will sound while the lights come up slowly to illuminate the Dr. stiding in, motioning her assistant to follow.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">assistant goes to a large switch and turns on hot light over parked gurney - simulate operating room light</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/kali.htm">Kali</a> starts with assembling the new body from pieces as she softly sings her words to <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/merris.htm">Merris</a> haunting violin and maybe a bit of keys from <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/belladonna.htm">Belladonna</a> - she hoists the lift table up with <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/ennui.htm">Ennui</a> acting as EyeGore - in a hunchback costume and weird mask - once the table is raised <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/nausea.htm">Nausea</a> climbs on while the gong crashes and lightning flashes start - as <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/nightshade.htm">Nightshade</a> settles into a heartbeat EyeGore drops the table down with the softly pulsing light - <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/nausea.htm">Nausea</a> will twitch her hand on the dance floor side - <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/belladonna.htm">Belladonna</a> wrings the shriek from her keys as <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/nausea.htm">Nausea</a> sits up and rolls off the table - a second shreik as she stands, grabs her guitar, and launches into the first dance number - now it has words and is called <a href="../../../gm_resources/info/lyrics/deadgirl.htm">Dead Girl Living</a> - as the dance beat builds <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/kali.htm">Kali</a> flings off her lab coat and whirls into dance as <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/ennui.htm">Ennui</a> ditches the hunchback costume, strips off the mask, and grabs her bass - the band is off into another night of hard hitting music</p>
<p class="regtxt5">beginnings of the scene:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"Come EyeGore, we must be quick." the doctor admonished the ugly assitant pushing the gurney in behind her. the doctor glided to a table of instruments and pushed it to the gurney. cartoon medical instruments were used in various combos to work on the body on the table.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"EyeGore, more bodies!"</p>
<p class="regtxt9">the assitant waddled out and pushed in a wheelbaro with a body slumped in it. several saw strokes and the doctor held up another piece. as she stitched it onto the figure on the gurney haunting music built in the mix. she began to sing with it, softly at first, of her lover dead and of this last effort to bring her back.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">the stitching finished she secured four hanging chains to the table. "Raise the platform EyeGore," she commanded. the hunched figure scuttled to a huge wheel and tugged at it. slowly the table top rose to the ceiling high overhead. lightning flashed and the violin fell silent. "Life, "cried the doctor, "Give my lover Life!" she shreiked at the sky. lightning flashed again and again. in the background a heartbeat drum rythm began slowly and haltingly.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Original Concept</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dementia walked out on the stage after the last set by DJ Death. "I know we had DJ Andros scheduled in for the last part of the night, however I have had a very special request. Our very own Love's Bitch has decided to return to the Devil's stage after a long absence. Please give them a proper Cathouse welcome."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked around in surprise at the hoots and calls from the crowd on the floor. Through the thunderous noise 3 women wheeled a sheet draped gurney onto the stage. Silently the one in a pink wife beater, black leather buckle sided pants and cat face makeup broke off and moved to a drum set. The second one, dressed in a white wedding gown with train, greyish face with suture lines and wild tangled dark blonde hair broke off and strode to a waiting rack of keyboards. Kali gave a start as she realized the third figure, dressed in a blood red crop top, spider web stockings, black velvet short dress, and a tuxedo coat with makeup similar to the keyboardist, was Ennui. Ennui set the wheel locks on the gurney and walked to a waiting bass guitar. A single spot flashed on the bed and dimmed to a soft glow as the drummer slammed a huge brass gong. A second flash of light and crash stabbed the figure on the bed as the drummer picked up a slow heartbeat rythm. The dim light began to pulse softly in time, growing a little brighter with each double drum beat.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly the keyboards shreiked out a shuddering groan as the sheet draped figure lurched upright. As the sheet fell away the last figure rolled off the bed and half crawled to a waiting guitar stand. Slowly she stood, grey face and suture lines a fitting addition to the faded, torn, and stained pink dress she wore. She took a deep exagerated breath, and launched into a sizzling riff. The band erupted into the first heavy drum and guitar dance number of the night.</p>
