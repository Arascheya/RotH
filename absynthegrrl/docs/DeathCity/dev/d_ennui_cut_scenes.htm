<p class="regtxt5">There has always been an us and them barrier between the circus and the townies. I think it comes from the way we pull into town, entertain them for a while, and then go away. To them our life must seem like a glorious escape. Most of us agreed with that even though we saw the hard work and danger that the townies never saw. By the time I was twelve I could see that my mom didn't share this view. She faded a bit more with each town we passed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mid way through the tour she recieved a letter which seemed to cheer her up a bit. I didn't realize what it meant until I came off stage from the last segment of the clown act. Still running on the performance high I didn't notice the serious expressions mom and her assistant wore. I skipped over to my locker and slipped out of my costume. As their words oozed into my brain I slowed down until I stopped half undressed. "Are you sure about this Amanda?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes Marta. I've given it a lot of thought. Anna needs to learn how to live in the world now. There's no guarantee she could stay with the circus anyway. Besides, I am so tired. I can't keep forever running. I need to stop and settle somewhere. Charles is a wonderful man. We've kept in touch since high school."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Don't wait to tell her. She loves all this and she won't thank you for taking it away. Give her time to adapt."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She glanced over and saw me by my locker. "Anna, honey, how long have you been there?" A longer look at my frozen stance must have told her. "I was going to tell you later. Get dressed and we'll talk."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I dressed with shaking hands and slowly walked to where they stood. "How can you do this to me?" I asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shh. Lets go talk."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"NO! How could you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Anna," she snapped, "You keep your voice down young lady. I'm still your mother. Now let's go talk."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I followed her to an empty corner of the arena where she tried to explain. "I can't stay here anymore. It's killing me slowly. I know you love it. I wish I still did. Each passing year it gets harder and harder to get back on the train. Charles has a nice place and a younger daughter you can play with."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It won't be the same."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, it won't. But until you are eighteen you'll have to give this a chance."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"NO! How could you do this? How could you not tell me?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry I </p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slipped out of my costume and reached for my grubbies to help with tear-down. Mom handed me a different set of clothes and told me to follow herAs the equipment came down and the

Anyway, back to her jumping the train when I was twelve. Circus folk have always viewed the townies from a kind of us and them view point. They enjoy the shows we put on but they also view us as other because they don't understand how we can do what we do. Well I had found this book at one of the libraries where we had an arrangement. The circus could borrow books when we came through and return them the next time we came through. I had found this book about a woman who ran away with a gypsy. It was really cool how she left one social system and learned to adapt to another. It was hard at first because suddenly she didn't fit with her lover's group but the non-gypsies started to view her with the same suspicion they showed to the rest of them. In the book was this great term, gaje, meaning non-gypsy. So a bunch of us adopted it for the townies. It really flipped my mom out. She suddenly started to think maybe I needed to be exposed to the townies to learn they weren't all that bad. Looking back I think the issues were much greater than that. She was getting tired of the costuming demands and I think she longed to settle down again.</p>
