<p class="regtxt5">We were on the way back from a simple recovery when I felt it. Something on the world we were just passing reached up and drew me down. I couldn't explain why it was so important, even when Merris asked when I said I was diverting to check out something.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was a dark grey night when we dropped onto the empty stretch of track. One of those nights that could be almost any time of year except summer. I was surprised that we were in a section of a smaller city instead of in a remote and quiet area. A figure in a long black duster with a weathered forest green backpack was walking along the tracks in front of us. I knew she had been the one to call us down. I slowed the train and stopped just in front of the walker. Silently she held up a pad of paper. On it was written, "I request a ride on the Death City Metro. I enter of my own free will. My name is not important."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All thought of asking her name left as I read the words and replied, "Enter and be welcome...then." I got a better look at her as she climbed into the cab. Faded was the first word that came to mind. Her duster was worn and old looking. she wore faded olive cammo pants and a dusty rose T-shirt. Her eyes were a washed out blue, her hair no-color brown, and she was thin and ordinary. It would be very hard to pick her out of a crowd. Silently she stepped over to the spare jump seat, stuffed the notepad into her packsack, and settled in. I wanted to start a conversation to fill the silence but when I turned to her the words froze on my tongue. She sat wrapped in a stillness so complete I could not intrude. She remained silent and immobile as the train climbed away from the world and into the void. Her complete disinterest was puzzling.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stirred suddenly as we approached the Portal. Before I could say a word she was standing and staring through the front windows directly into it. For the briefest moment she seemed to shimmer and shift in the same pattern as the Portal. It was so quick I wasn't even sure I had really seen it. "It's not a good idea to stare to long into the Portal. It's too easy to get lost in it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned to look at me and damned if I didn't see the Portal where her eyes were, again just for the barest moment before she turned silently back to staring. Completely unnerved I returned to driving and left her to herself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once we were through the Portal I began to slow to stop at Portal Station. Merris would want a report of my unscheduled stop. The woman pulled her notepad out of her pack and wrote rapidly. When she turned it to me it said, "She has forgotten. There is no reason to stop." She returned to the jump seat and settled back into her stillness. She didn't stir again until we were almost at Central Station. She wrote briefly on her notepad as we slowed. When I pulled the locomotive to a stop at the platform she stood and turned the pad to me. "Thank you," was all it said. Silently she climbed down, darted swiftly across the platform, keeping to as many shadows as possible, and disappeared into the station.</p>
