<p class="regtxt5">Contains common room/meeting area, sleeping area, watercloset, bathing facilities, small kitchen, storgae, and food pantry. It is not really just Kali's. It is actually used as the meeting and planning office for the beginning <a href="d_extract.htm">Extraction Team</a>. Kali uses the bedroom in the dome as hers but the rest of the car is considered common spaces.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The lounge area is light warm texture paint with art deco style torchier lamps. the lights give the walls a warm yellow tone. A carved wooden folding screen shields the passageway back into the other areas from view. There is a large <a href="../../../common/item_images/samovar02.jpg">samovar</a> of jasmine tea sitting under the right hand windows. There are several comfortable older style chairs in the room and a very large one near the front that Kali can curl her 5'8" frame into and still feel enfolded. The floor is dark hardwood with a rich patterned oriental style rug in the center.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">An arched opening in the left side of the forward wall leads into a small commercial kitchen and an alcove with a steep stairwell up. The doorway is partially closed with a bead curtain. The stove and oven are to the left of the opening and the sink and prep surfaces are to the right. Stainless steel cabinets are placed strategically to store spices and cooking equipment.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A doorway in the center of the forward wall of the kitchen leads into the pantry. Refrigeration equipment is on the right and regular shelf storage is to the left.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The stair leads up to Kali's bedroom, which is located in a domed section on top of the car. There is a large bed, a couple of trunks, and a small writing table and chair.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The lower level corridor leads to a small bath, a door into the pantry off the kitchen, and storage lockers. The bath contains a toilet, circular shower enclosure, and sink.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<p class="sectioncaption"><a NAME="dementia">Dementia's Car</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She has an elaborate stereo with various styles of music available at the front of her common area. A <a href="../../../common/item_images/samovar.jpg">samovar</a> filled with jasmine tea sits on a table to the right of the car. The main room is lit with oil lamps hanging from wrought iron fittings attached to the walls. There are thick, hand woven carpets covering a hardwood floor. Comfortable chairs formed a small cluster to the left side of the room. The forward wall contained a wooden and glass cabinet housing a stereo and a collection of music. It was surrounded by book shelves stocked with leather bound books.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The light panelled passageway to the rest of the car goes off from the front left. The first door is to a small bathroom with an enormous claw foot tub, old style wash basin sink and watercloset. Wine colored curtains for privacy from the outside and burgundy towels complete the image.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The next compartment held a largish bed with an intricate brass work frame. Tall brass candle holders held column candles casting dancing shadows over the rich tapestries masking the walls. Thick black curtains screened the window.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The next door opened into a small kitchen with an attached dining area. The kitchen gleamed with stainless steel commercial grade appliances and neatly arranged equipment. The dining area featured a narrow table with two booth style vinyl bench seats.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The last compartment was a mixed pantry and storage area. At the end of the passage was the connection to the rest of the train.</p>
