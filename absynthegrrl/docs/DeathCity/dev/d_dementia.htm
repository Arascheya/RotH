<p class="regtxt5">/* Angelique has left her something */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Greetings to the Seer from the London of the Hut. This is a world of Gates. Lassitude shall seal the first. More shall rise. The Daughter of the Dark Mother will feel the sting of this world often in the times ahead. Conflict between the proxies, the lessers, and the Scion of the Great Mother shall struggle to regain the footing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We are well in the hut of the Great Mother, the Aspect of Balance, the hut that was of the feaster of flesh. Daughter of the Russias must give way to the Daughter of the Dark. Lest both perish. We bid you good fortune and miss you greatly. Were the walls between the Scion and the Realities thinner we would seek to visit you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hugs and Kisses, Angelique</p>
