<p class="pagecaption">Sammi and Jemima History Data - from R17</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* R17 comment: Here's a little something I knocked up after work tonight - it's a snippet of Sammi's history from before she met Jemima.  There's probably lots wrong with it, it's the first serious writing I've done in ages! The background is that Jemima's just asked Sammi when she first started getting gunged "in public". */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi laughed and tossed her head back, her shimmering hair catching the early afternoon sunlight in ripples of golden light.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oh, how there you're asking deep questions!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Well, I was fifteen.  Everyone I knew back then thought I was sixteen, as I'd lied about my age when I met them and never had the nerve to put things straight, but I figured one year out didn't really matter anyway.  Anyway, old Andy said he had a new idea for a display that was sure to bring in the punters, but he needed someone who was willing to get "really dirty". At first we all thought he meant some kind of hard-core sex show, hell some of 'em had tried that before, only to get shut down by the law, so we figured the old man must have worked out some way to get something like that past the coppers.  But then he explained he had this idea where a dancing girl got buckets of slop thrown over her from off-stage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now, remember I'd never told anyone back there about what I enjoyed, if I wanted to play in the muck I'd hare off on a bike all by myself and not come back for hours, and seing as how we all tended to be fairly grubby most of the time anyhow, no-one really noticed if I came back with a few extra marks or even still-damp clothes on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi sat back a little further, he big blue eyes turned inwards as she recalled her other life.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anyhow, without even realising what I was doing, I stuck my beer bottle up and said "Ok, I'll do it".  I think that surprised a few people, I remember Andy coming over and giving me a good look up and down - I think that was the first time he'd ever actually looked at me as anything other than a mouth to feed - and as no-one else objected or volunteered, he said "Ok, you'll do".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Well, over the next couple of weeks they made me a costume to wear, plastic jeans, work boots, this lovely big black shirt with huge sleeves that I tucked into the jeans, a belt of stainless steel links, plus a matching collar, a black cap with more steel links, and then over the clothes I wore the black "veils".  Only one of them was a real veil, over my face, Arabic style, the rest were variations on mesh over-clothes. There was a floor length mesh skirt, open at the front, that clipped to the steel belt, then there were fine mesh panels, kind of like bat wings, which went between my arms and my sides, there were two seperate parts that cliped together at my shoulders and waist to make a kind of long tabard, and finally a mesh cloak, complete with hood, which I wore over everything else.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Notice how from the sides and back I had at least three layers of mesh over my clothes, and two at the front?  They all cliped on with these neat little steel fasteners, which were designed to hold, but not too strongly.  The idea was that as the slop was thrown over me, the weight of it would be too much and the "veils" would come off me as I moved.  As each layer came off, more slop would be thrown until I gradually lost them all.  The original plan was that they'd stop throwing stuff when the last veil fell off, but I suggested the audience would probably prefer me to get completely slimed, clothes and all, and Andy agreed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So, on to our first night.  The word had been put out about what I was going to do, so lots of people turned up, both townies and other squaders from the camps.  It was probably the first time any of them had ever looked at me too!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They started up the music, I tried to loosen up a bit just out of sight at the side of the stage in the old truck trailer.  I was nervous as hell, partly at performing on stage at all, but mostly at the idea that I was going to be getting covered in slop, in full public view, and not one of the people there would have any idea how much I was going to anjoy it!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Time came, and I spun out onto the stage and started weaving and turning, all moves designed to make my veils flow around me.  We'd decided that I should dance through a couple of tracks like that, then have a breather which would let some of the audience get to the bar, then I'd start again and the sliming would start half way through the first track and keep going until I had lost all the veils and got completely covered.  When I was ready to stop I was to throw myself full-length on the floor, they'd chuck an extra bucket of slop over me then kill the lights so I could get off and cleaned up.  Well, cleaned up is relatve, it ammounted to Andy hosing me down with cold water!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anyway, I danced and weaved, and the crowd seemed to be getting quite into it - I think they liked my costume, even clean and dry.  Of course there were the odd ones here and there with that look, but by then I'd learned to control my reactions, seeing what the squadders did to anyone who even looked at us women the wrong way did a hell of a lot for my personal rebuilding.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Well, I danced my way through the first three tracks, ending the last by spinning off the stage to end up where Andy's crew were filling my buckets.  I didn't look too closely, I knew they'd not put anything truly degrading in, but they did have a pretty evil sense of humour, so I figured I'd be better not knowing the details until the stuff was flowing over me.  I do remember striking a few poses and joking with them about when the best times to hit me would be.  Mostly they seemed glad they were doing the throwing and not the receiving, though a couple of the lads and one of the wives did look a bit as though they'd have fancied playing too.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">But, I was the independent so it was my job to be on display.  I had a beer, more of Marissa's homebrew, not exactly refined but with a hit like a sledgehammer, then the music came back up and I spun back out onto the stage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now, they'd said they'd hit me with the first load "half way through the first track", but we'd never actually defined what would count as half way.  I couldn't see into the wings because of the lamp glare, so when I got to the second chorus unslimed I figured they were waiting for the guitar solo to start - when all of a sudden a wall of slime engulfed me from the left side.  I was turned slightly to the left when it came, it was actually one of the poses I'd joked about earlier, so instead of all going on the mesh cloak, it got the cloak, tabard, skirt, my shirt sleeve, and some splattered on my face veil.  Most of it was on the cloak and skirt, and none of it was heavy enough to snap out the fasteners, so other than stumbling slightly from the shock I managed to keep going.  The audience loved it, I could hear claps and cheering, but I was too busy keeping my balance, and trying not to concentrate too much on how nice it felt where the slop had reached my clothes under the veils.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The crew were nice to me, they let me regain my balance and get back into the dance before they threw the next bucket over me, and this time they did it while my back was to them, so it all went on my cloak.  It was a shock as all that cold wetness landed on my back, but it didn't throw me off balance this time and I kept going as if nothing had happened, with bright green slime flowing down the back of my costume.  I could feel the weight pulling at the cloak fastening round my neck, though it wasn't quite enough to snap it open.  I was actually more worried that the tabard snaps would open first, as they took more strain than the cloak ones did, and of course the slop was flowing straight through the layers of mesh, I could feel it flowing over my bottom through the plastic jeans.  I think the crew had guessed the same thing, though, as a couple of seconds later a third bucket took me on my right side, again towards the back so it all went on the cloak.  That increased the load quite a bit, so I leapt up and sure enough the cloak fastener gave way and I let the slimy mesh flow off my shoulders behind me as I circled towards stage left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Of course stage left is where Andy was so as soon as the cloak had fallen I took a full bucket of yellow slop to my mesh skirt on one side, followed imediately by another one to the other side.  That was enough to pop open the skirt fasteners round my waist, one by one, so as I crossed the stage again the skirt unwrapped itself from my waist and followed the cloak to the by now very messy floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They gave me a bit of time to recover, so I danced on, raising my arms now to make the "wings" flow and move, and letting the audience enjoy how the slimed mesh tabard flowed and moved over my PVC covered legs.   Remember I still had the face veil on at this point, with just a few splatters on it, which is just as well as I couldn't really hide how much fun I was having!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I circled the stage a couple of times, then they let me have the next load, bright green oily slop, delivered at chest height to my left side.  That totally saturated my left "wing", drenched my tabard and shirt, and splashed all over the face veil, which promptly fell off. Before I could recover I got another bucket, yellow this time and even more oily than the first, at waist height, which was enough to pop the fasteners on the tabbard and leave me with just the wings, my already soaked shirt, and slime-covered jeans.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was begining to feel a bit tired, and realised I'd have to finish soon, but I wanted to go out in style so I raised my arms and started miming flight round the stage.  The crew realised I wanted finishing off so they let me have six or seven buckets each side, which soon pulled the wings off and left me in just my clothes.  I danced back to the centre of the stage and started doing an eastern weaving type motion, both halves of the crew realised what I wanted and I got bucketed from both sides at once.  Without the veils to deflect and absorb the slop, my shirt got totally saturated, plus I could feel some of the slop flowing down inside my pvc jeans.  I threw myself face-down onto the pile of slime-soaked clothes in the middle of the stage, Andy threw his last
bucket of slop over me, getting me square in the bum - you should have seen me squirm for that, I just couldn't help myself! - and then the lights died and I just lay there, getting my breath back and savouring every feeling of slimieness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After a while Andy came over to see if I was all right, I said "yes, just a bit winded", and let him help me out the back where he could hose me down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And that, my dear, is the first time I ever got gunged in view of other people!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">- Sammi.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">New Section</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Remember I said Kali'd need a "special crew" for the train she
eventually hauls with the Baldwin?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Standard rescue mission to yet to be named location.  Sammi & Jemima going as workers, not crew.  Work starts as usual, then demonic ambush.
This sort of thing is not supposed to happen - system was agreed by The
Powers long ago hence area in which DCM operates should remain "between
the worlds", however someone is violating that.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi & Jemima end up on their own (having set up distraction so other crew-members could get clear?), fleeing demons into labrynth of tunnels
beneath city.  They manage to kill some demons and loose the rest, and
stumble into a tiny, half colapsed subway station.  Station is of
"modern" type and nothing much to preserve, but at the platform, in the
un-collapsed section, they find an original, 1896 vintage Glasgow
District Subway train.  In reality these ran (with some modifications
like electric traction but essentially as-built) until 1977.  On board
they find a badly wounded man (characher still to be realised) - he
somehow saved this 2 car set when the system was modernised in 1979 and
trasnported it to this other world, only to get caught in what's
happened since.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a hint that somehow the train has saved him, a kind of 19th century sentience is present, a pale shadow of what the DCM later
became.  There's also a strange "ion cannon" mounted in the open leading
doorway of the leading car, beside the driver's position, and attached
to the main traction power supply.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now, meanwhile, unknown to S&J but not too far away, a disparate group of folks, who all knew their world was about to be destroyed, have gathered in an underground goth club, and with dozens of batteries to
keep the music and lights going, chosen to live through the bombardment
in the sealed-in club, then kill themselves with CO once they know
everything else has gone.  How they knew what was happening is unclear,
but they have this great sense of anger at so many innocents being slain
for what ammounts to a greater-powers power game.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Speaking of power - there's no electricity supply to the subway station so the little train is stuck there.  While they're still trying to
figure out what to do next S&J hear the sounds of demons in the
undamaged tunnel ahead of the train, and also in the passageways they
entered via, so they realise they're about to die themselves unless they
can figure a way out.  Leaving the injured man on the train is clearly
unacceptable.  Then Sammi has an idea.  Using magic, she casts a circle
and calls for raw power, from their own people, which she then beams
directly to the pick-up shoe at the rear of the motor coach, while
Jemima scrambles to work out the controls.  The power comes up just as
Jemima figures out what to do, and as the first demons stalk out of the
passageway onto the platform, the little train starts to move - rough
and jerky, but moving.  Into the tunnel they go, with Sammi maintaining
her desparate power-shunt on the verge of passing out, and Jemima
peering into the gloom ahead.  Demons appear on the track, and Jemima
fires the cannon, which causes all power to be lost for a moment so
they're plunged into darkness and Jemima has to re-set the controls and
start notching up afresh.  However she's killed the bulk of the demons
ahead of them, and the train runs over the survivors, splattering ochre
everywhere.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They keep going like this for several minutes, but eventually find the way ahead completely blocked where the tunnel has collapsed.  Branching
down a dead-end side tunnel, Jemima finds that there is no air in the
brakes and so they crash through the end wall (shielding comes up, plus
Jemima fires the cannon again), and stagger to a halt in the middle of
the goth club.  Sammi passes out as they stop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Somehow they've managed not to kill anyone (people heard the rumbling coming and got back from the wall).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is some conversation between Jemima and the club people.  They're safe for now because the tunnel colapsed behind the train, and between
them all they work out a plan.  The clubbers strip the venue to it's
bare walls, and then all of them (180 people plus 5 staff) cram
themselves, and all the club's equipment and movable decorations, plus
the batteries they've been using, onto the train.  Obviously this is an
overload beyond all sense, if it wasn't for that "hint of power" the
whole thing would collapse - but she takes the load.  The batteries are
connected to the traction supply, giving enough power for about another
5 minutes running, plus a few of the club people call on magic of their
own to supply power.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There's a story to the people who do this - some of them give their lives in the effort, for reasons related to what destroyed their world -
one man manages to link to his murdered girlfriend's spirit and they
both turn themselves into energy to drive the train.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi is still out cold, almost drained, but with the extra power she's now got available Jemima is able to raise full DCM shielding around the little train, and with a silent plea to "hold together now old girl,
just give me another few minutes", they roll forward, through the far
end wall of the club, carving their own tunnel up through the ruins, out
into daylight, through an army of demonic beings and finally roll to a
stop on a flat wagon of the real DCM.  Everyone bails out and helps to
lift all the gear, club stuff, etc, off the little train, and the
freight pulls clear bound for the Portal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The clubbers, plus Sammi & Jemima, are all put aboard a sacred unit supposedly bound for the fields of rest (dropping S&J off at Portal on
the way) - except that while normally when people are found alive during
a rescue, they are dazed, lost, on the verge of death, and get carried
in the SUs to a place of rest and healing before moving on to their own
afterworld.  This time, though, the goths know exactly what went on and
they want to be able to strike back.  Their gods agree, and hence
instead of the peacefull, 50mph gentle ride that the SUs normally take,
this one takes an all-new route, non-electrified but with the overhead
catenery materialising in a blaze of electrical arcing above the first
coach, passing over the pantograph on the power car, and then vanishing
again above the last car, and finds herself doing 100+ (i.e. 25% faster
than design max speed).  The driver realises that this run is special
and simply keeps the controller wide open all the way to the portal,
through Portal station (which they hammer through at max speed scaring
the living hell out of everyone on the platforms and earning amused
"tut tuts" from Merris!), and all the way back to Death City itself.
S&J, riding in the brake van, find themselves carried along with the
ride and hence get home a lot quicker than expected!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And hey-presto, 185 active, angry, out-for-vengance goths who, once healed and rested, can't wait to get back out there and start dealing
out some of what was done to them and the ones they loved.  Leapordess's
train is the obvious place for them to go, and S&J waste no time in
introducing them to Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Poss they help with the restoration of the loco, under Kali's
supervision?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">- - - </p>

<p class="regtxt5">I've had the core of this idea floating around since 1998, but this is the first time I've worked the whole thing out.  It helped that I spent
last night at Black Sheep in Leeds (http://www.sheepish.net) - that let
me finalise everything!</p>
