<p class="pagecaption">Inner Beings, Inner Demons</p>
<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - inner child */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The pain slammed through her as the blackened twisted hulk started screaming. The shrieks echoed through the shattered wreckage of herself. She tried to reach out and comfort it, but it huddled back on itself, blood leaking through cracked and blistered skin. Howling in agony it backed away from her as the screaming rose to fever pitch.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It slammed through her, the pain and loneliness of a lifetime of hiding. Sobs wracked her as she slid down the wall and curled into her self on the floor. Shaking, she pulled herself into the space between the bathtub and the wall, hiding in the shadows. She huddled there whimpering.</p>

<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - inner child 2 */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Everyone speaks of the ‘inner child’ shall I tell you of mine? She, at least I think it’s a she, sits in the center of ruins covered in blood and ash. Imagine ground zero at the world trade center collapse, or maybe Berlin after World War II. Empty grey eyes stare sightlessly at the wreckage around her. As you try and move closer her mouth opens and she screams, an inarticulate howl of absolute terror and pain. The closer you come the more she screams.</p>

<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - inner child 3 */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">i was taught to focus emotions inward. any strong emotion was not to be shown around my house. rage, hurt, fear, all of them were taboo. so i looped them inward. now, even when i know better, the wreckage remains inside where the firestorms ripped through. and in times of great stress i snap back into that mode and flamestrike myself again before i can think about it.</p>

<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - inner child 4 */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">she felt the power stir and flow deep within. turning she followed it down to the twisted broken landscape within where her inner child huddled. she stopped at the sight in front of her - a ring of fire swirled and pulsed around a standing being. its face was blackened, burned, and skull-like but the eyes that surveyed the wreckage around it were clear. wreathed in fire it smiled at her with a calm she had rarely felt</p>

<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - writing */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It’s why I write. It’s the only time when the rats chewing in my head are quiet. The only time I am at peace, where I feel like I can truly belong. It is the only way I can remain sane. If I ever stop being able to write, that will be the end, bullet in the brain time.</p>

<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - writing 2 */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Arrrgggg!" Kali paced the room moaning and pulling her hair.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris stood and slowly walked over to her. "What is it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know what's mine and what isn't. It’s the insanity I write for Shandi, that need to rend and tear. The feeling of blood running over her hand as she rips a vampire's heart out and tastes it. Kara as she cries for Valen half dead near the hyperdrive, me as I pace this room. What of it is me, what of it is them?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"They talk through me. I hear them, see them... sometimes they won't let me go. I did a short fan fic for a tv series once, not cause I wanted to, because I had to. Someone else's characters wouldn't go away until I did..." Kali shook her head and continued, "I don't know how to explain it better than that. They demand their time, their say, and they haunt my thoughts and dreams until I let them have it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why are you worried?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I, I’ve never really gotten used to it. I was a science type. I liked the neat order of science and technology, cause and effect, everything rather neat. This is rough and bloody and - and unsettling. They invade my fantasies, they live in my dreams, they invade my world view. There are times I walk down the street as the predator that is Shandi. I look at the stars with the longing of a ground bound Eritsani. I imagine the feel of a vampire bite at the moment of orgasm. Sometimes I feel lost in the crowd of them. Like an actor too long in a part I loose who I am in their visions." she stopped and stared at Merris, "And here...I don't know what could happen if I let them out to play here. Can I hold them to the page, or will they burst forth with more, as more?"</p>

<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - rage */</p>
<p class="sectcapt2">/* on balance */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - "They howl inside and claw to get out. How do I keep them at bay? How do I keep the demons under control? How do I kill them? Make them go away?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lizabet - "Balance. You can only balance them. You can't kill the demons, not really."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - "Balance," she howled in agony, "what am I supposed to do?" her voice rose, "let them have a say?" her voice rose to a shout then, "let them out to play?" she screamed the last, "how the hell do I balance them?" her voice dropped to a broken whisper, "I want to be good..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lizabet - "What do they make you feel? What do they give you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - "Rage, they give me rage. On a good day it's only frustration and restlessness. A desire to play mean, to be cruel and uncaring." a twisted smile flitted across her face for a moment, "but then I hate myself for it. I feel dirty and awful and ashamed and want to go hide somewhere." she thought for a moment, "what could they possibly give me that would be of any benefit?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lizabet - "Would you say the Dark Mother is evil?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - "What? No way!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lizabet - "Is she good?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - started to speak, stopped and thought a moment more, and said, "No, not really. I’d say she just is."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lizabet - "Then might not the same apply to you? Think about this: restlessness brought you here. Was that bad? Rage saved your friends. Would they have survived if you hadn't jumped in? Cruelty, you are right, that's a hard one. Think though, think of the Dark Mother, is she always gentle? What about 'tough love'? You might consider that what you are is what your friends, and this place, need you to be."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - sitting thoughtfully - trying not to judge herself for once. after long moments she shook her head and sighed</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lizabet - knowing she was still judging herself, even in the silence, continued - "The Dark Mother just is, as are you. If she does not judge you, don't spit in her face by judging yourself. Balance is all, it is the key. Only the Old Ones understand there can be no good without evil, no light without darkness, no happiness without sadness. Embrace them all and just be."</p>

<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - storm - shortly after 'on balance' */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The dark clouds slid up the river on the tail of the winds whipping at the garden. The darkening of the windows pulled Kali’s attention away from the computer in front of her. She padded to the sitting room and looked out as the clouds piled up above the cathedral. As the light faded and the first lightening bolt flew she raced to her bedroom, throwing the curtains wide she slipped out onto the roof. The wind whipped her hair out behind her as the first drops of rain splashed on her face. Within moments the rain became a wind whipped torrent drenching her in seconds as she opened her arms wide and turned her face skyward. Wind blown and rain washed she leaned into the storm with eyes wide open and her voice raised to the sky in a triumphant shout, "YES!!!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris came in and looked around downstairs. Not finding Kali she gathered her courage and headed up to the bedroom. She stopped in shock at the site of a thoroughly soaked Kali, arms raised to the storm, standing on the rooftop. "Kali, what are you doing?" she shouted to the figure on the roof.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Come out, the weather's great," Kali shouted back. When Merris didn't move kali slowly eased back inside. "Ah!" she glowed with satisfied pleasure as the water dripped off her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Can I ask you why the wind fetish?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure. It always reminds me of my happiest times. Standing on a mountain and setting a seismometer while waiting for the helicopter. Just me, the mountain, and the person helping me. No need for appearances, social stuff, or anything else."</p>

<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - rage 2 */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - It kept me alive...there were several times suicide entered into the top two of options. What always kept me back wasn't love of life, or fear of hell, but rage. The desire to not let the bastards win.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The hardest was the despair. It ate at me always, silently in the background. The inescapable feeling of being just a screw-up. That’s where I needed the rage the most. It was the only tool I had to keep it at bay. The desire to hit back, to keep going as a giant fuck you to the down sayers.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I couldn't reconcile it. I was supposed to turn the other cheek, lie down and just take it, but something wouldn't let me. With no outlet it turned inward and flashed through like a firestorm, burning everything in its path. By the time it was done I didn't know what I was anymore.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I still can't reconcile that rage is a part of me that is ok. Whenever it bubbles up it still feels really wrong. So the raging fireball takes another tour through my insides instead.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">So much burned beyond recognition. So much burned. What was it before the firestorms? Nothing left but ashes. What was it all supposed to be?</p>

<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - rage 3 */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is still enough rage inside that I do believe there are times for a 'leave no survivors' approach. At least it seems to work when fighting the demon forces. I still have trouble with the programming of it being wrong from childhood though. Gods why is it so hard to puke out the shit programming of bad religious experiences?</p>

<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - rage 4 */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* This one is after being in Death City for quite some time */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It has taken a very long time but now the demons are balanced. I can let them out when I’m on a mission and hold them back without the firestorm ripping through me. I can look into the fire and accept that it is as much of me as everything else. I still wish it had been different, but I guess so many others here can say that as well...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The sick thing is though I don't want to kill them any more. Even if I could I wouldn't. Without them I’d be empty and boring.</p>

<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - on shells */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">So many shells welded on my soul I sometimes don't even know who I really am. Or am I just fooling myself thinking there is a reality under all the patches?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">gods - mutation after change, am I more or less than what I started as? Some days I think I know and then I remember something else that seems so different from what I am now. When did that person turn into this one?</p>

<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - living in shadow */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you stay to the shadows so much? You’re bright, talented, and loving."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I always felt ashamed - of how I moved, looked, thought. I thought if I could just stay in the shadows, not let anyone see, that I could slip under the radar. The last thing I wanted was attention of any kind. Attention was bad. Bad things happened when I was noticed. The shadows are safe. I don't have to prove myself there. I can be and be left alone. I don't want to be great, don't want to accomplish some great thing. I don't want much responsibility.."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Whoa there girlfriend. No responsibility? Who is it that is one of the best extractors around? You get called when it's going to be really bad."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ugg," Kali grimaced, "yeah, well, guess you got me there..." she paused and continued. "I guess it's because I like the shadows. It’s more fun in the shadows. Let someone else have the limelight, get the credit or the blame. I like being mostly invisible. I can dodge expectations. Besides, it warms the dark places in my heart to see something unfold and know that I had a hand in it but won't have to take the notice for it."</p>

<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - on safety */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">write something on her need for safety, and the fact she never felt it...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - Safety is an illusive thing. Even now that I know I have the skills to handle most things that could come my way doesn't mean I feel safe. Feeling safe is about knowing and feeling that nothing is going to come at you. It’s about feeling like you can let your guard down, about not having to keep the emotional shields up against something coming at you from out of nowhere. That’s feeling safe and it's something I’ve never experienced.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris - But you're safe here. Nothing comes out of the dark here.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - That's true and my head knows it.  I just haven't got my heart convinced yet. My past taught me there is no safety anywhere and it is a lesson I am having a hard time un-learning. Surely you've seen it before in others here.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris - It's pretty common here. It’s just you never seemed one to have that problem.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - I learned to hide it well. My past was based on show no weakness and reveal nothing more than absolutely necessary. Anything revealed would be used against you.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* this came from a buffy/faith story - but it is a good kind of descrip to work from */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You'd guess that being the slayer, sorry B, *a* slayer, I'd feel safe anywhere. I mean, I can handle myself pretty good, in fact, there's only you who's ever whipped my ass, but that's not just what being safe is. I guess I learnt that from the shelter. There's kids who come in there who could cut you up with a knife before you even saw it coming, but they don't feel safe. It taught me that feeling safe is where you don't have to have faith in the fact that you can cut someone up, or you having magic slaying powers. Where you don't have to use them is where you feel safest."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The worst of it is you never truly shake the feeling that there's something waiting. So you never are able to believe the safe place when you find it. You sit in it and your mind remembers all the other times when it was an illusion. So you sit with your back to the wall and the defenses still tuned and ready, even when you don't need them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You jump at sudden movement. An unexpected touch triggers a need to strike out, not the comfort that was intended. It leaves you in a cage that is no longer real, but is still so ingrained that you never really believe it is gone. You jerk at a lover's touch because for just one instant you're back in the dark place and the touch could be anything.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It haunts your reactions forever. The old reactions are the ones that fire first. Someone asks something out of the blue and the reaction is from the past, haunted, fearful, resentful, whatever it was then. It happens whether the other deserves it or not.</p>
<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - on words */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* this may be over-kill, but it can be considered... */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I learned that words were lies. They couldn't be trusted because they were at odds with the actions around them. It taught me cynicism toward professions of love and caring. The actions have to say it because the words don't mean it. Words were the instruments of pain. They were the tools used to flay the soul. It wasn't until I could stop believing the words that I could escape.</p>
<p class="sectcapt2">/* inner beings, inner demons - on strength/weakness */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the hardest part of life is turning a weakness into a strength - ie - desire to hide in shadow and belief in nothing - think about this...</p>
