/*  r17 -
I'd kind of visualized it like this - remember how you were feeling a bit down?
Well, you're walking through downtown Seattle, on a dull, cold, rail swept, dark
winter's day, near evening, when all of a sudden there is this tramcar in the
middle of the street.  Now AFAIK Seattle doesn't have trams, but nevertheless
there it is, painted black, windows aglow with tungsten lamps (no fluorescent's
in DC!), looking warm and friendly against the leaden sky.  For a moment, you
hesitate, then you think "what the hell - I'll go somewhere!", you jump on, toss
the conductor a quarter, take a seat, the doors close and off you go!  Unlike S
& J, you don’t take long to get there, the tram jumps through an
interdimensional gate to get direct to Death City, and you get off near the
Cathedral, and just kind of follow your instincts to the pub.  Extra info -
you're wearing that green & black outfit you mentioned - I hope it's
washable!<grin>  */

/*--------------------------------------------------- opt 1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------*/
It had been 3 long months and I still couldn’t believe it had happened. I’d been the one to find her, coming home after a long day. Nothing was missing, they hadn’t even molested her, just shot her twice, once in the guts, once through the chest. Every blank spot on the walls was covered in red graffiti condemning  queers and freaks.

Feel free to embellish this tale any way you want  - or even do something
entirely different - I'm S & J's chronicler, the rest comes to me "through a
mist" as it were - so you know as much about it as I do.  The only things you
really need to know are that there are no fluorescent lights (ugghhh) or 60's
modern (i.e. ugly) buildings in Death City - and that It's kind of like Glasgow,
Norwich and Amsterdam all rolled into one.

  > Do those who ride the Metro live on the Metro all the time or
  > are there times when they’re in the city of a while?

They live in the city "between trips", though some chose to stay on their trains
in the carriage works - the population includes many abuse survivors (of all
kinds), and for some of them railway compartments are the only safe place
they've ever known. If you associate buildings with pain, you're unlikely to be
happy living in one, even if it is a masterpiece of gothic architecture.

  > What is the final plan for the rescued beautiful things?

Ask the Goddess!  I don't know all the details of this tale, it's bigger and
richer than any single idea.  I assume that when "the final day" comes, and
human souls rejoin with the creator, the stuff they've created will "move into
the next world" kind of thing - following the principle that all creation is
sacred.  Of course, some things (like the pub) need to live to be preserved,
which is where Death City gets it's buildings from.

No problem - ask whenever you like!

Hey, they're _lifebonded_ - only the final death of both of them can break that.
They enjoy sharing their fun with others, as long as the other person (or _very_
occasionally couple) is enjoying the experience, and happy with it.  Their own
relationship is so deep that they share almost everything - it's not the easiest
of ways to live, for if they're apart they go through hell for each other, but
they both know with absolute certainty that neither is capable of betraying the
other.  For example, if you were to pour a jug of custard into Jemima's top,
_both_ of them would feel Jemima's emotional and erotic reaction - so you can
imagine the ecstasy they share when they do each other.

OK - you're wearing it!  All three of us (S & J & me) _love_ the sound of that -
I hope you don't mind being _totally_ drenched in yellow custard - Jemima's
going to enjoy this, she likes doing someone in a long skirt occasionally, but
for good reasons (to do with her childhood) Sammi won't wear any kind of skirted
costume.

This is how you appear in Death City - as your inner self.  BTW - you are a
_fantastic_ dancer.

Oh dear - remember this is a _very_ playful couple you're dealing with here -
now they want to climb the spire!  It's six hundred feet to the top, and they
_both_ want to climb it!  You'll have to lead that trip, after all you are the
one with Thieves Guild training<grin>.  It's a good thing that Joe(the
landlord)'s younger daughter is the same height and build as you - you're going
to need quite a few changes of clothes! She won't mind if you get them gunged -
she's "that way inclined" herself, which is one reason this is S & J's home in
the city.

There is a FAQ - Captain Fluffy keeps it.  Don't lurk - Delurk!  It's fun!  You
get purrs from me, corn nuts from Copper Squirel, Vicki puts you on the
subscriber list, and the Captain "Fluffs" you - now that IS an experience!
Plus, you can join the rest of us in the pool party, or go back to my Castle.

I've not been on for about ten days, but the weekend should fix that.

As for the books, the generally agreed order is:

Arrows of the Queen / Arrows Flight / Arrows Fall

Magic's Pawn / Promise / Price (IMHO The best she's done - breathtaking)

Oathbound / Oathbreakers (some say read this after Arrows, before MP/P/P)

By The Sword (3 books in 1)

Winds of Fate / Change / Fury

Storm Warning / Rising / Breaking (Breaking out next year - Arrggghhhhhhhhh!)

It's available on draught _everywhere_ here - Guinness went out of fashion after
a nasty take over battle with "Distillers Group" that cost a lot of Scottish
jobs.  Many Scots nationalists (like me) will not touch Guinness now.

Will do! :-)  Actually, methinks that _a little_ of it finds it's way back here
- like when some poor hardworking architect who really _cares_ about his
buildings suddenly finds the drawings for a project that needs something
_special_, but who's funding is being cut back by the "fat cats" have been
embelished with loads of genuine victorian detail, and just _happens_ to find a
warehouse full of original cast iron decorative brackets & stuff neatly packed

I understand.  We all have our scars, somewhere deep inside.

Actually, there is something I want you to know - I _won't_ be "using" you when
I write the gunge section - i.e. I'll do it as sensually and romantically and
caringly as I can, but I won't be "getting off" on gunging you.  To me that
would feel a little like I was raping you - and I think you know what I'd like
to do to rapists.  I wanted you to know that.

When I first decided to write a story for the wet and messy newsgroup, I sort of
"called" for characters, and Sammi & Jemima came willingly, knowing that both I
and my audience would get a sex kick out of their fun - but they didn't mind,
they kind of see it as a fair price for having their stories told - and they
came to me because they knew I wouldn't descend into the "gratiutous crudity"
that so infests the alt.sex groups.

Am I making sense to you?  It's late, so I may be waffling a bit<grin>.

  > Glad they like it - it=92s one of my favorites! Childhood
  > scars - aren=92t they wonderful...:( (VERY heavy sarcasm
  > drips fr= om my=20 voice at this...)

She's said she'll tell the tale, but not yet.  For now she wants to enjoy your
company and your clean (but not for much longer<grin>) outfit!  Actually, she's
given me the basics - she grew up in "care" - i.e. state run abuse houses.  She
suffered under a series of fanatical, child abusing "matrons", all of whoom wore
skirts, and who enforced strict "girls in skirts / boys in shorts" uniform
rules.  She's over it now - though their fanatical cleanliness may be where she
got her love of gunge - she is unbelievably strong in spirit, even if she does
cry herself to sleep on Jemima's shoulder some nights.  That's one of the good
things about living on the train - the constant noise of the running gear drowns
out her soft cries in the darkness, and Jemima's always there for her.  Only her
closest freinds know about this - I don't know if it'll be in the stories, for
now at least I suspect not.

Before you can retire to the "other bathing chamber" <grin>, there'll be some
dancing in the pub - and you are going to make _quite_ an impression, especially
in green and black!

Ahh - I didn't realise you were staying for a while - I thought it was just a
flying visit, but that's no problem!  There are some _very_ fine shops in the
centre, other side of the station - and money will come to you if you _need_ it
- but you'll find yourself doing something in return.  How are you at cleaning
up wrought iron lamps?

None of us know anything about it!  You're the expert<grin>.  There are plenty
of hand and footholds - stone carvings all the way to the top, but it can be
windy up there, so some kind of rope would be a good idea.

The main tennent of my wiccan religion is "an it harm none, do as thou wilt".  I
don't start fights, but if attacked I fight back - also for anyone weaker than
me.  I'm not into "killing for glory", but it's up to us to defend ourselves and
the freedom we believe in.

I've read most of the 4 you sent - I like Kori, but it reads like a framework

I liked your bathroom, too - of course once Sammi & Jemima have "initiated" you

Bright Greetings and Well Met by Moonlight fair Lady Koriana!

Hiya!  Here, at last, is the finished story of your first meeting with Sammi &
Jemima. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.  Just a few
notes:  You refered to a "flightsuit" in your flat, now here a flightsuit would
be the Royal Air Force version of a boilersuit, the RAF version being padded and
lined, and having extra pockets on the legs and arms.  I suspect, however, that
you actually mean just a boilersuit, a single thickness one piece industrial
jumpsuit, like the dark red one the woman in "The Net" was wearing while she was
in prison.  Is that what you mean?  Anyway, that lets you know what Jemima's
outfit looks like.  Sammi's "dungarees" are like the overalls you see American
train drivers (steam trains) wearing - what you call Railroad Engineers.

Thing 2: <grin>

If you're looking for something to do work wise in the City, take a wander
across the river (there's an ancient medieval stone bridge a bit upstream of the
tavern), through the parkland, under the main line, and look in at Temple Heath
Locomotive Depot.  They're always looking for new hands in the running sheds
(where they maintain the locomotive fleet), and you can work on steam, diesel,
electric or all three - the foreman's a sound bloke, and as long as the jobs get
done he lets his people do what they like. You will of course get a little dirty
(especially if you work on the diesels), but you don't have to get gunged or
anything - that's strictly a free time activity, and entirely up to you - now
that you've experienced it S & J won't mind in the least if you don't do it
again, so don't feel under any pressure.

Do you want to write the next bit?  I've left the tale with the three of you
lying in the mess, so that if you don't like it we can just leave it there and
you can appear clean and dry the next day (if you want to stay longer, that is -
I hope you do!). On the other hand the usual way to follow a gunge session is
with a shower party, there's another bathing chamber through the door near the
window, with a large sunken tub and several shower heads, where the three of you
can wash off and strip (I suggest we leave that bit undetailed, unless you want
to detail it<grin>).  Something that Sammi & Jemima like to do is wash each
others hair in the shower (while still dressed but with most of the gunge washed
off), the three of you could stand in a circle and each do the one in front, if
you want.

Btw - I saw the end of a programme about Seattle on TV the other night, they
were going on about bad "anti-homeless" laws, but mum said that earlier it
looked like a really interesting place, and the views I saw were lovely.

Can I ask a favour for the future?  Now I know this is a bit cheeky, so no
problem if you think it's a bad idea, but I've allways wanted to visit the USA,
there is a tourist "rail rover" ticket Amtrak do that gives unlimited travel on
its trains for a week or a month, and it's dirt cheap, and with my new job I
might finally have enough money to really do it in the next couple of years.  If
I do, is there any chance I could meet you, and (here's the cheeky bit) if I
paid you could you put me up for a night or two?  I understand that as a lesbian
you (or your partner, who sounds like a wonderfull person btw) might not be
happy with the idea of a man staying over, so I understand if you say no, and I
won't ask again, but would you consider it?

Thanks for listening, and I hope you enjoyed the story<grin>!

Subject: Inkubus Sukkubus tape is on it's way!

Bright Greetings Lady Koriana!

Just a quick note - two days ago I posted you a tape of two Inkubus Sukkubus
albums, "Wytches" and "Aconite and Belladonna".   I didn't fill in the track
listing because (a) my writing is terrible and (b) I didn't want to have an
excuse for putting it off any longer - I tend to do that, say "I'll do it
tomorrow" and then never do it.

So, here is the full listing :)

Side A:, "Wytches":

Wytches
Pagan Born
Gypsy Lament
Leveller
Conquistadors
Burning Times
Song to Pan
Enchantment
Catherine
Church of Madness
The Rape Of Maude Bowen
Dark Mother

Side B:, Belladonna and Acconite:

Beltaine
Midnight Queen
Trinity
Belladonna and Aconite
Soul Inside
Song of the Siren
Vampyres
Eternity
Incubus
Old Hornie
Samhain

I hope you like them!

They are all brilliant, but my personal favourites are Wytches, Leveller,
Burning Times, Church Of Madness, Dark Mother, Belladonna and Acconite, Eternity
and Samhain.

Wytches is, of course, about us witches <grin>, Leveller is about death as the
"Only True Freind of the Poor" ("he comes as a Leveller to make one and all the
same", etc).  Burning times is a call to resist a return to the age of witch
hunts (appropriate for the Christian Coalition, methinks!), Church of Madness
has got to be the ultimate in Fundamentalist Bashing, and Dark Mother is a song
to Hecatae, who I am thinking of asking to accept me as a follower.

Belladonna & Aconite is about flying on broomsticks (and sounds very like a
"train song" to me - listen for the tripple beat of Sammi's locomotive's six
wheeled bogies running over rail joints), Eternity is a "darkside" love song,
and Samhain really resonates with me, I'm a "dark" person at heart, I love
subteranian spaces, Winter, and night.

Anyway, I hope you like them, and if you decide you want them on CD I can give
you an address in London that will accept cheques in US Dollars (they are $17
per disk, including international postage).  Here in the UK the CD's are ten
pounds ($16.50) each, but that's cheap, most CD's here are about $20 to $25
each.

btw - I've managed to meet some fellow Solitary Wiccans at the Glasgow Pagan
meeting group, so now I'm going to be part of a circle for Yule - Brilliant!

If you want to learn more about Wicca, join the mailing list by sending
"subscribe solo Koriana" to "listproc@listproc.bgsu.ed".  We're a really
freindly bunch, with none of the
"tripple-power-super-duper-hex-a-rama-fest"<grin> spammed up flame war fundie
ranting that goes on in alt.pagan, etc.

Happy listening!

Blessed be!

John, The Renegade.

No problem - take as long as you need to.  I'm not exactly one to churn things
out willy nilly, I'd rather take the time to do it properly.  I've got a few
ideas kicking about just now - methinks you're in for a cab ride rip into the
void and back over the hoildays!

  > *blush* I'm fairly ignorant about Hecatae, umm, could you
  > tell me a bit  about her?

Well, I'm just learning, but:  Hecatae, Queen of the Night, Queen of the
Underworld, Goddess of the Dead.  She's one of the "Dark Mother" aspects of the
Goddess.  Her feast is not long after Samhain.  You'll hear several references
to her in the Ik Sk tape.

I'll see what I can find, and get back to you after the holidays.

I _love_ places with no light pollution - street lights are necessary for
cities, but I wish they could reduce the reflected light in the sky - you can
see the lights of Glasgow from thirty miles away sometimes!  Once mum and I had
a holiday on the Norfolk Broads, and the first village we stopped at had no
lights (apart from the lights of the pub windows) - magic!

Me too!

Well, if you _like_ them and you _can_ afford it, I would appreciate it if you
buy at least one of them - I don't like ripping people off, there's too much of
that about these days, people who want something for nothing and never give
anything back.

I've unsubbed from both alt.pagan and alt.religion.wicca now, the list is _much_
better, even if it does throw people off at random!  Btw - we have several
lesbian members - I thought you might want to know that.  RavenBreath and
Bronwyn spring to mind - the weird thing is that I seem to get on really well
with all of them, somehow I relate much better to independent minded women who I
_know_ are not into "power" relatiinships.

  > Koriana

Have a good holiday, and I wish you both love and happiness.

Blessed be!

Have a nice time!

I know how you feel - I felt that way the first (ok, the only) time I gave
blood.  Trust me, unless they're fundie Christians or something, you'll be OK.
I'll pray for happy meetings for you.

Oops - that wouldn't be the tape you couldn't remember the contents of would it?
The one you tossed out last night?  <grin> !!!

As to the story - well............ (to be continued!)

    > Cool! thanx for the info!

No problem.  I'll see what else I can dig up, though the folks on
alt.religion.wicca can probably tell you more.  Try rain@teleport.com, I think
she's got a web page with a lot of pagan stuff on it.

    > thanx a lot!! I'll probably send in a subscribe note to the

Now that IS a good idea (subscribing that is).  There is a LOT of good info on
the list (plus my ramblings of course), and little flaming.  There is the odd
bit of "Christain bashing", but we try and keep the brake screwed down on that.

--[Norfolk, no lights]--
    > Sounds wonderful...*sigh*...:)

It was - there is no better way to spend a holiday than cruising round a lovely
part of the country at 5mph on a boat, with someone you love.

    > Sorry - I worded that poorly - I meant if I can't get them
    > locally, I'll  send off for them...

Oops - my turn to appologise, I realised that's what you meant.  I've been
debating the "copyright vs someone's ability to buy things" theory with a few
people.  Remind me and I'll give you more info on this later.

    > 'tis nice to know!

    > There is something about strong women...:)

Indeed!  :-)  I just hope I can find one as a partner some day, someone to share
the good times with, and to lean on when things get tough.......

I suppose I want to be one half of a Sammi & Jemima type relationship, a
partnership of equals.  The trouble is, most women think I'm strange for that,
never mind men!  Still, next year I'm going to join a pagan intros agency
(that's reccomended by the British Pagan Federation, so it's not a rip-off).
Perhaps that way I'll finally find someone.......

Oops - sorry for that!  It's the only bit of my life that's not yet complete,
but that's no reason to bore you with it! <grin>

Well, I tried.........<grin>!

Actually, three hours ago I thought I'd lost everything - I installed a new hard
drive (as D:), except that when I tried to re-boot, the computer reported them
both dead!  Arrggghhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fortunatly, it turned out to be a screw up with the drive cable Maxtor supplied
with the new drive - was I relieved when I fixed it and got everything running
again!  Wheww!!!!!

    > Koriana

Have a wonderfull trip, both of you.  May the blessings of the Lady be thine.

Write to me when you get back, I want to hear all about it!

Blessed be!

<p class="regtxt5">Sacred units plus Central Station - an overview:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sacred Units: <a href="http://www.railway.stormshadow.co.uk/railway-glasgow303.htm">R17 - Original Page</a> - <a href="sacred/sacred.htm">Snapshot of Page</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">I took those pictures back in about 1992.  The station is actually Glasgow Central, which is a bit more elaborate than Death City Central, which is actually based on the old London Euston.  The main differences being tha Euston had a lighter roof structure, with columns on each platform, wheras Glasgow's massive roof-girders cover the entire 13-plaform station in just two awe-inspiring spans, supported in the centre by the huge columns you can see behind the unit.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When I get some time (soon!) I'll create a detailed diagram/map of the area around Central Station, the river, and Temple Heath Locoshed.  I suspect our frames of reference are rather different - somehow I get the feeling of far more "open space", plus a dustier, drier environmant in your writing than I'm visualising, but that's probably just down to the differing environments we're familiar with.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Btw, "Sacred Unit" was actually a nickname for 303s used by some of my railway mates back in the 80s and 90s, becuse I liked 'em. Traditionally, "bashers" always prefered locomotive-hauled trains to multiple units, so I was a bit odd in liking MUs (and coaches) instead of just locos.  Anyway, one dark night some time in the late 80s, hammering northbound through the outer subburbs of Glasgow on a railtour homebound to Gourock, I remember someone yelling into our compartment "Hey, tell Jack one of his sacred units is getting looped!", and sure enough, we flashed past a stationary 303 which Control had stopped in Newton Loop to let our special (running early and doing over 100) past it.  The name kind of stuck after that. :-)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The last ever 303 run was December 30th this year, sadly I couldn't afford to go back to Glasgow to be on it.  A couple have been preserved, though - but not the one in the pictures.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hope some of this info is usefull!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Will answer your questions in full eventually, might be a week or two though, things have suddently gone sour at home, not sure why. :-(  Anyway, I should have my own place within 2 weeks, looking forward to finally being on my own.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A couple of thoughts:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I've always seen Eternia as having basically a west coast UK climate - mild, fairly wet, some fantastic sunshine in spring and summer, some snow in winter, but no extremes.  Coldest it ever gets is about -10 (centigrade - been decades since I saw a farenheight tempreture scale!), warmest is about 35.  For reference, 0 C is the freezing point of pure water, 37 is human body heat, 100 is the boiling point of pure water.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There's a reason Eternia has this climate - it's a place of healing.  Many of the places crews go to are very arid - side-effects of nuclear or massive-ordnance warfare, plus places about to go nuclear have generally already wasted their natural environments.  So the landscape is very western-highlands, lots of lakes, sea-inlets, mountains, plus rolling green countryside with woodland.  Actually as the place isn't that densly populated, there's a lot of virgin forest, mature woodland with Oak, Ash, Alder, Birch, etc.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There's lots of moisture, but no oppressive humidity - rain is generally cooling in summer.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Newcommers sometimes complain about the rain at first, but once they've been there a while they realise what a blessing it is, compared to other places.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In the summer it's not uncommon for people to dance in the rain, especially a few days after a rough trip.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Magical side-effect of Eternian rain - when there is a need, it washes things clean.  You can imagine the kind of unpleasant grime (not to mention foul ochre) that manages to collect on running gear, coach sides, couplers, etc...  After the rain, it's all gone.  Completely gone, and memories washed clear too - not forgetfullness, but peace and freedom from the kinds of haunting nightmares that would otherwise come.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">So the people dance in the rain, and wash away some of their sorrows, and when they return to their trains they just take it for granted that the stock is spotless too - it makes up for some of what happens.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Of course Kali doesn't yet know about this, it's one of those things that just happens without anyone noticing - but she will, when she moves Leopardess out of the shed for the first time and it rains that night, and in the morning she finds the finished (or undamaged) areas of paintwork that look like she's just out of an auto-showroom, especially the leaping cat image.. :-)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">More later - I've a few issues to work out regarding S&J and their WAM tastes vs the development of the story.  The two are linked, but not in a deep way and it's not necessary for every story to have wam content (for example the summer rain-dance is nothing to do with that, it's pure healing) - but at the same time when I "called for characters" and S&J answered it was specifically because of the wam issues that they came, so it wouldn't be fair to them to now tell the story with that part excluded.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Aye! The complexities of storytelling when the main characters have lives of their own! :-)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Not really sure what's going on - talking to Megan she seems to think that somehow she was doing me a favour by threatening to make me homeless.  No, I don't follow that one either!  She seems to have calmed down now though and hopefully I'll have my own place by next week so no major harm whatever happens.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Thursday is Beltaine, so unless we get heavy rain I'll be spending at least part of the night up at the Nine Ladies Stone Circle.  I've Friday off work so if the council manage to send me my allocation letter by Thursday or Friday I'll be able to wander into their "property shop" and see what's available Friday or Saturday, and probably move in there and then.  All I'll need to do is hire a van.  Of course I'll have no Internet for the first couple of weeks, but I can always do net work here at work.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">ummm - sorry if my comments have prompted the confusion(not sure that's the right word) about wam and S&J - i wasn't asking for less wam or anything like that, just additional bits about them as well...:)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Oh - don't worry about that, it was actually that your comment set off stuff I'd been thinking about for the past few months anyway.  Basically I need to kep everything in context.  Which actually means I need to get seriously writing again.  Long, involved and elaborate wam sessions belong in long, elsborate and detailed stories.  Which means I need to start working rather more than I've done for the last few years! :-)</p>
<p class="regtxt9">yes - characters can be quite determined and difficult if they disagree with what a writer thinks they are.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You've had that too, then? :-)</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Ellie played the first of the weekly gigs at the Liquid Lyrics last night. it went really well - and the fun part was the crowd was all friends of the band - bar got full when the band played and emptied out when the band finished...:)</p>

<p class="regtxt9">a couple more thoughts/questions</p>
<p class="regtxt9">what sort of transport is available in Death City? - personally it would be nice if automobiles were rare to non-existant - the noise and smell and all...:)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As it's basically a medieval European city, everywhere is fairly close together.  Transport in the heart of the old town (round the cathedral area) is by walking - it's all cobbled streets and gas lamps, and lots of alleyways and passages you'd have trouble getting a motorbike down, never mind a car!</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is a tramline down the main street, and beyond Central Station this branches into a network which links together a group of villages separated by green space, and then comes together again to serve the docks - let me think a bit more about this, as the layout's not fully visible in my mind yet.  There is also a railway to the docks, branching off the passenger line somewhere near Temple Heath (probably at the entrance - the yard and sheds being built on the land bounded by the main line, docks branch, and river).  Possibly the docks branch descends into a tunnel which then passes beneath the river and slopes down to the docks - Death City Old Town may actually be on a slab of higher ground, with a more industrial and 19th century seafront area below, and the river flowing round and down (possibly via a large waterfall?).</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are boats on the river, this is another means of transport, with a canal (possibly including a boat-lift) linking old town to waterfront.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The tram system is entirely operated by a mix of ancient double and single-deck cars, so all wooden frames, turn of the 19th century electrics and control gear, and incandescent lamps.  I suspect it's one of the systems that a writer can control to an extent - if Kali regularly needs to go somewhere that's too far to walk, then the first time she gets there it will be on foot, but when it's time to leave, she'll suddenly notice the tramlines in the street nearby, and someone will happen to mention that yes indeed, the No 36 (or whatever) will take her all the way back to Central Station, and the late service is still running.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Have a look here: <a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?G2M?X=623500&Y=308500&A=Y&Z=2">Death City Map</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is the centre of Norwich, which is what the Old Town of Death City is based on.  Things that change - the station is on the other side of the river, and somewhat grander.  The Adam and Eve is in it's real place at the corner of the footpath you can see just above Bishopsgate.  Note the whole Cathedral area (close as it's known) is actually walled off from the rest of the city, with gates and doorways, some of which are locked after dark.  You can vary the route of this wall, as IIRC Kali's tower is actually quite close to the Cathedral itself, which to me means it must be just north-west of the nave of the church, so with one aspect to the Cathedral Close and one to the Old Town, and several alleyways branching past it.  Possibly there's actually a door from the building into the Close, so residents have the best of both worlds?  In this case the door would come out level with the West Front of the cathedral itself, quite close to the gate out into the main street beyond.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Here's a site about the Cathedral with lots of history and some very nice pictures: <a href="http://www.norwich.gov.uk/norwichcc/homepage.nsf/framesets/tourism.htm">Cathedral of All Faiths</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">The reason I know the place so well is because mum and I used to take boating holidays in the Norfolk area.  There are moorings just upriver of the station, and it's a totally magical place to be.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">if the Devil's Cathouse remains in an unused warehouse perhaps Leopardess could reside on a siding that used to service the warehouse when she wasn't out on a run - at least after the new goth club crew is brought on board...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Now that makes sense, and indeed there would be such lines, some of which are awaiting rebirth with some new use.  I'm thinking this place might be on the other side of the old town to Temple Heath, (so North, somewhere near the top curve of the river though probably on the south (city) side, with the siding on it's own top-span lattice-girder bridge over the water). there's some kind of long looping freight line running round there, crossing the river somewhere higher up and taking a rather convoluted route round.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Btw, if these maps don't fit what you've been thinking, feel free to change things round - just let me know what's where!</p>

to the idea, in fact you've extended it in exactly the right ways.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">/* notes:</p>

<p class="regtxt12">the basic thought here is we fight when we have to not but not until</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Correct.  Any action taken is defensive.  Most trains aren't armed, at least not with offensove weapons, and the usual reaction to en
encounter with demonic forces would be a withdrawal, though "withdrawal"
could equally well mean "running the buggers down" as the shielding,
which comes directly from The Lady, is pretty much impregnable.  It's
necessary (as shown in the second S&J story) to enable crews to reach
the places they need to get to after destruction has visited.  This is
related to the power and shielding S&J create in that story snippet I
sent you - though note that the effort all but kills Sammi in that case.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">i see Death City as being under the Lady, the Dark Lady, Lady Death, Kali, etc. <g> - who is an older power, probably much older than the ones currently meddling in the affairs of the beings of the Realms - so she feels she needs to meddle less in the day-to-day affairs through chaos and order fights and all the rest...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spot on.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">is any of this close, or am i way off? :)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">See above!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Btw, I've been thinking about a couple of things regarding storytelling techniques.  Remember the rough outline you had for the new crew being introduced to the QBC?  I'd suggest you remove almost all description of the train and surrounding yard from that snippet, leaving only vital bits, say that someone stands up on a rail or crossing-frog (the pointy bit where the tracks split) to gain height, or comments about "oily ground", etc.  The thing being the detailed description of the equipment should have come earlier, when Kali (I suspect assisted by several friends including S&J) first assembles the consist from various places.  Then, when you're doing your intro bit, you only have to make passing references to odd bits of detail (a polished wooden handrail, or fancy lamp, etc), which has already had it's story told, to evoke the scene.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This gives you space and freedom to express the dialog and interaction, without having to keep breaking off for descriptions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">What do you think?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Possibly we could even split this?  I could do some of the detailed stuff, leaving you to focus on dialog and personal bits?  Anything in particular you want included (like the leaping leopards on the windows, etc), let me know about and I'll then be able to do the "90% action" section where they assemble the train (this will be in parallel with Kali finishing off her work on the locomotive - basically once everyone realises she's actually going to be able to pull it off, they all pitch in to find appropriate stock for her, and some real oddities turn up, stuff that someone, somewhere thought "might come in usefull some time" but never actually found a use - until now).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I mean people will have been helpful and supportive all the way through, but that will really take off when they realise she really does have what it takes to bring the big steamer back all the way (usually it would take more than one person to acchieve what she's doing).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There's a ballance thing here too - the only other person who's done a full "nothing to full service" job before is the older male driver who originally brought the Sacred Units to the system, again when no-one else knew they'd be needed.  He persuaded a crew to save the whole fleet instead of just a single set, and then worked like a slave to bring each one, one by one, back to life.  He also has his "special crew", 2 per unit, generally known as "<name to be determined>'s waifs".</p>

<p class="regtxt9">ear skrytchies and BIG hugs!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thanks - they were much appreciated!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You know what?  The one I miss the most is Tabby.  Still, he'll doubtless find someone else to skrytch his ears, just as he found me. That cat belongs to no man (or woman)!.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Assuming the weather is good a pleasant afternoon could be had talking over story ideas and watching the trains go by - would you enjoy that?
It would also be a very S&J thing to do, as it's how they used to while away the hours through one long hot Summer when they were both broke and surviving on casual evening work in random bars and clubs.  Certain people were after them, so they lived semi-wild through that Summer, only seeking shelter again when the weather turned and the threat had abated.  And no, they've not given me the full details of that story yet either! :-)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I think there's a great deal more of their past to be uncovered.  Of late I've been seeing a scene where their train's stopped for a few days in the "outer realms", and they take a wander up into the hills together, talking over old times and each other's lives before they met. Some of what happened to them (particularly Sammi) was pretty rough, and it's taken her quite a few years to be able to talk about some of it, even to someone she'd happily die for.  That's what that little "show" snippet with Sammi's dance was about, at that point in her life, in her mid to late teens, she's only just discovered her own tastes for wam, and is still trying to come to terms with it.  Whether it's a reaction to her earlier childhood, or her natural taste, is hard to tell, it's probably a mixture of both.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The other thing is I have no idea how old they really are just now. Sometimes I think they're in their late thirties, other times I get hints that they may be much older, and that these tales are actually from quite a few years ago.  Every now and then I get this faint image of them as an old couple, still vigorous, still attractive, and still with a wild sense of fun between them, but white haired and into their 70s.  I'm not sure if that's real, or possibly a glimpse of their own future.  When I do get these flashes, I see them as some kind of "guardians", with younger protégé who they protect from... not sure what.  The balances are shifting and there is more interaction between the different realms, magic is involved somewhere down the line, and while the DCM continues it's appointed task of preservation, under the leadership of the Goddess, there are other, deeper, more complex tasks, risks, and dangers which must be faced on all levels.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hmm... This tale is growing in the telling!  Somehow I get the
impression that in this part of their story, S&J are at even more risk of death, sometimes quite literally holding back the dark forces by their own power alone, yet that's made them even tightly bound to each other in love and trust.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">hmm - i'll check with Ellie on the shirt - i would definitely like one - XL please - i am not a small person...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They only come in one size but then they fit me and I'm 6' tall and not exactly slender.  You can see a current pic of me at <a href="

<p class="regtxt5">Can you let me know ASAP if you want one for Ellie as well?  I'll need to get them ordered and allow time for delivery.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">BTW - gotta be succubi - the wings are a dead give-away...G</p>

<p class="regtxt9">chocolate is always a favorite!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Great!  I've bought some bars of Swiss chocolate from Ikea.  Do you prefer dark or milk?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">as for pictures - no worries - i can pick your brains for descriptions to help me get the idea - then if you ever are up there we can set up an ftp location and do that as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Will do.  Sorry I couldn't get down but everything is getting rather frantic here, and getting worse!  We had a bit of a meeting in the pub after work, and the consensus amongst us is that we're all OK for about three months, but after that we'll all be made redundant.  Time to get the old CV dusted off and start looking for another job!</p>

<p class="regtxt9">mostly i am really looking foreward to knocking ideas back and forth about Death City and the like! i can hardly wait...:)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Me neither!  As you can see above, ideas are already leaking out... :-)</p>

<p class="regtxt9">big hugs to you from both of us!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Muchly appreciated!</p>

<p class="regtxt9">yes - indeed we do drink spirits. g</p>

<p class="regtxt9">i missed the reference last night, but you are back in the same location - pre Megan - as when we first started writing? is that a lucky coincidence or is there a story there?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aha - no, what happened is I'd gone back to visit my mum, who still lives in the same house we both used to stay in, in Gourock near Glasgow.  That was just for the bank holiday weekend though, I'm back in Sheffield, England, now.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">yeah, i know what you mean - i stopped reading alt.sex.stories not long >after that as well - for the same reasons - signal to noise got too bad. i still remember reading the second piece and going Wow - such a cool concept...:)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">blush-  Thanks!  I'm really glad you liked them.  Of late, I've actually had an idea to re-work the entire thing, sorting out the mis-matched and incomplete details, and separating the detailed wam descriptions from the main story.  The thing is if I sit down to write a wam story, the objectives and rationale are entirely different to writing a "story story".  S&J are quite happy to share their wam experiences, it is what drives them wild for each other and I suspect they enjoy telling it almost as much as they originally enjoyed doing it, but it does get in the way of the more general tale, and I get the impression they want me to get on with telling the whole story.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There'll still be wam in the "main line" tales, but just in outline, not the current "dollop by dollop" stuff, which will move to a series of "pure wam" vignettes.  This should free up the "main line" for much more in the way of proper storytelling.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">it's sometimes hard to believe how long ago that was - i doesn't seem like ten years. does that mean that like a fine wine the stories have matured and aged to perfection? i like that better than we've been busy and distracted and just plain haven't written much on them...:)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">gryn!  Possibly!  It's not quite ten years though, it was the Autumn of 1995 we started chatting, eight years ago almost to the day!  I wrote my first wam stories for the wam newsgroup (which back then had a great community, and whose ruins now lie submerged, drowned beneath an endless tide of foul corruption and evil spam), in the Summer of that year, while I'm pretty sure Sammi & Jemima came into my life in the early Autumn, and you followed soon after *hug*.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I suppose I really should have been working on my CV or job-hunting, but I got the writing bug instead - just a snippet, but I thought you'd
like it.  This is the beginning of the section I was telling you about, when they go off into the hills above the outer junction station and recount some of their individual histories to each other.  First draft of course, but I *think* it's a bit better than the last bit I did.  Need more practice! :-)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">- J.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">--[]--</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima, legs braced slightly against the motion of the carriage, grinned cheekily at herself in the compartment.s full length mirror as Shergar.s long train hammered through the sunlit outer lands.  Once again, they.d come in early, and so would have a few days of pure relaxation in the empty spaces of the outer realm before running back through the Portal and into Eternia proper, and the two women had promised each other that this time they.d take that hike into the hills they.d often talked about but never got round to doing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi had gone off down the coaches to the Controller.s office in one of the compartment brake vehicles towards the rear of the formation to find out just how many days they.d be spending at the little country junction station where early workings waited their time, and Jemima had taken the opportunity while Sammi was out to dress for their impeding ramble.  Looking back at herself from the mirror was a tall, slender woman of about 26, dressed in a black, well-fitted boilersuit, worn over a shiny black one-piece swimsuit, with twelve-hole Doc Marten boots on her feet, and her unruly dark curly hair framing her soft, attractive face.  She braced her hands on her waist and admired the result, still grinning.  The outfit flattered her figure, the elastic-waisted suit accentuating the curve of her bottom, and the high collar, fastened with a stud against her neck, focusing the viewer.s attention on her face.  Jemima
knew this was an outfit Sammi particularly liked, and looked forward to surprising the shorter woman when she returned from her walk down the train.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Abruptly she heard light footsteps in the corridor outside, the door slid open, and Sammi, wearing the soft faded blue denim gear she normally used for casual wear, stepped into the compartment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">.Five days my love., Sammi said as she slid the door shut behind her, then she caught sight of Jemima, and her fine features lit up in a radiant smile.  .For me?., she asked, indicating Jemima.s costume.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">.Yep., Jemima grinned back, reaching out to draw Sammi into an embrace, .just for you.  Well, at least mostly for you, I kind of enjoy dressing like this myself too, you know!..  The two of them giggled at each other at that.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">.Five days of relaxing., Sammi said, gazing up into Jemima.s deep brown eyes, .but we.ve still a hundred miles to run to the station.  Fancy a proper hug?..</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With that, Sammi, still with her arms round Jemima.s middle, backed over to their bed and sat down, pulling the unresisting taller woman down with her.  For a long moment they just lay together, arms round one another, gazing into each other.s eyes, silently giving and receiving the deep emotional bond that had held them together through so much.  The train sped on through the safe landscape of this outer realm, running along a wide plain with mountains visible off to the east, the well laid single track heading north, towards the gentle hills which marked the beginning of the outer climb toward the distant Portal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">.I love you., Sammi eventually murmured, pulling Jemima even closer with her arms.  The taller woman responded by wrapping her legs tightly round Sammi.s, and freeing a hand to gently stroke her long blonde hair.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">.I love you too, crazy girl., Jemima whispered back, allowing her hand to gently caress Sammi.s hair and then running it down her soft denim clad back.  .And hey, I am indeed wearing this for your pleasure as well as mine, so feel free to enjoy it!..</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With that Sammi gave the taller woman another tight hug, before pulling her hands free, and starting to caress Jemima all over through the black material, running her hands carefully over legs, buttocks, trunk, sides, stopping to slide in and out of the various pockets.  Jemima lay still, enjoying the feel of her lover.s hands running over her suit, being happy just knowing how much pleasure Sammi was getting from exploring her dark-clad form.  They.d both learned long ago that just being near each other gave them both an emotional boost nothing else could match, and they.d also learned to enjoy each other.s different approaches to their shared moments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali - back to R17 - 28 aug 2003</p>

<p class="regtxt5">let's see - Kali arrived in Death City when she was about 35, although the place let her feel much better than she had in quite a while...sometimes i see her growing old, sometimes i see her ending early - sort of like the scene near the end of Dev_Notes:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* begin short scene */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The two danced, drawing dark force and light force almost as one. The intensity built to a fever pitch as massive energies crackled in the temple. Then with a sad look at her friends Kali reached out and danced into the arms of the high priest. Energies touched and cancelled. A soft pop was all they heard as the priest and their friend ceased to be. The demonic hordes bearing down on them paused, then broke and ran. The dark portal rapidly faded leaving only a grey stone wall where once it had been.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* end short scene */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">in either case i see her clawing her way up to be the leader of the best Extraction Team available. what's more in question is how long she remains to keep it going. it feels like at least several years and maybe quite a bit longer - my sense of this is as vague i fear as your sense of S&J - but long enough to make a positive difference in the complex tasks facing Eternia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Death City - sits at the center of a thriving, well functioning connection system between the various Realms and worlds, has a force of individuals that are close knit and effective together with a solid sense of purpose, a group of people who are outside the "moralities" of the younger Proxy War fighting beings...seems like there would be those in the Proxy camps that would want to push the issue and grab some of that for themselves. maybe there is some sort of shake-up happening in the younger gods that has allowed one or more from each side to gain more power than would normally happen - drunk on this power they want to take some of the benefits of Eternia for themselves.
just random thoughts spurred by your comments...:)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">there is also the in-flux of 158 people wanting to fight back - this could tilt the balance for a bit, which would also open up Eternia for a bit more direct involvement in the sqabblings of the young ones - at least until a new balance could be established. the Lady hasn't managed to set this up and hold it without having to defend and fight for it once in a while - there would be times when Eternia was more directly challenged...</p>

<p class="regtxt9">(from SnowDancer)how do the Power Shields get raised? are those built through the magic of the person(s) rasing them? is it a ritual of some type? or is it an item of power that almost anyone could trigger if they had the right device?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Item almost anyone can trigger, they are part of the original Lady's Gift from the origins of the system.  They are part of the "hidden aparatus" which makes the whole thing work.  Probably could do with some kind of detailing though, possibly they are generated by extra devices which "appear" on each item of stock claimed for the network, and these devices do need to be looked after in some way (magic or technical, I'd incline to the magical for this one).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">from conversations: If you die in Death City it is the final death, no going around again. New Death City persons are given the chance to go on to the Havens or return to the Realms after arrival. This is done before they go on anything dangerous to give them a chance to avoid the final death. If go on to the Havens can go back to Portal Station and catch a local Sacred Unit to the Havens. Otherwise can wait to take transport back to the Realms if that is where they came from.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* 23 Nov 2003 */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">What do you think of this?  Idea is that this is the real start of the "war" between Eternia and at least one part of the Demon Realm, and happens after the (still to be written) rescue mission where S&J find the subway car and the club people.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At this point Kali has Leopardess completed (btw, if we're going with a Mallet / Challenger style front end, would Kali have mounted some energy weaponry on the platform ahead of the smokebox?  The smokebox doors still have to open of course (splitting in two vertically will reduce the space needed, though Kali will need to do some clever engineering to keep them air-tight if she does this), but there did seem to be a fair bit of space, poss something like an artillery version of a laser, with the barrels mounted ahead of the compressors and the rest of the equipment in convenient places round about.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anyway, Kali has the locomotive and some of her passenger and freight cars (definetly including the business car you described earlier).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">More notes below:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A whirlwind of emotional responses flashed through the taller woman.s mind as Sammi went on with the news.  Shock came first, that such a violation of all the Great Principles should ever have happened in the first place.  Shock quickly gave way to horror, as Sammi, self-locked into her neutral state as only Jemima knew she could, grimed with dirt and smoke and soot and with still-oozing battle-scars on her right cheek, calmly detailed the horrors she.d witnessed and fought through.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">:She was only the driver, didn.t even have to leave the cab, hell girl I almost lost you for someone else.s betrayal?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima knew the thought was selfish yet she couldn.t keep it wholly from her mind, and as Sammi.s tale of carnage continued that thought helped to replace horror with anger.  Anger and, lightly at first but steadily growing, that deep-rooted courage she.d experienced so rarely yet which had carried her through so much.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi was still describing the attack.s aftermath, vaguely Jemima was aware of someone slipping from the room behind her, of hushed words and the rising anger of all their colleagues and friends gathered round, but all her attention was on her lover.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At last Sammi finished speaking, and only then did she raise her battered face to meet Jemima.s gaze.  Jemima took one step forward, wrapped her arms about the suddenly limp figure, and hugged her with all the strength she could summon.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Through her suddenly heightened othersenses, Jemima was aware of flashes of emotion all around her, anger, determination, the beginnings of vengeance, mixed with care for Sammi and sorrow for those lost.  Jemima still couldn.t quite come to terms with it, an entire train and most of its crew destroyed, hundreds of innocents slaughtered where they waited fully under the protection of the Eternians, sacred units attacked and pursued by demonic forces, and the survivors of the first train only rescued by Sammi.s insane risk-taking, gatecrashing a mission that wasn.t anything to do with her, and almost wrecking the train she was driving in the process.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Abruptly, she felt awareness surge back into Sammi.s limp form, and released the bear-hug she held the shorter woman in.  Sammi drew back, and looked deep into Jemima.s dark eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">:You.re going back</p>

<p class="regtxt5">:Yes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">.Then we go together..  A single phrase, yet both felt the depth of power and meaning in each other.s thoughts and words.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">.Don.t worry, I won.t get in your way or try and slow you down, you.re the warrior, I.m strictly backup support!., Jemima reassured gently, .but if you.re facing that.., her gentle face turned almost to stone, .that again, I need to be there.  And if the bastards do get you, well, they.ll have me to answer to.  Wherever we go, we go together, remember?..</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something in that last sentence finally melted the ice-locks Sammi had built to sustain herself through the horror, and she collapsed once more into Jemima.s arms, tears flowing freely at last as she gave herself up to a series of wracking sobs, great moans of sorrow and loss echoing round the now empty bar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">How long they held that embrace neither could afterwards say, but eventually the last of the bitter sorrow was drained, and Sammi pulled herself upright once more.  Without a word Jemima unbuttoned the sleeve of her black jumpsuit and used the loose material to dab the last of the tears from her lover.s pale eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Abruptly they both became aware of a female figure standing by the bright hearth, seemingly enjoying the heat of the flames.  Aware of their gaze, the woman turned, and seemed to speak without speaking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">:You two be wanted at the station.  And nay, fear not for each other this time, for ye are on a mission of fair vengeance.  The future?  Who knows.  But this night ye and all your people be safe.  Go, ride with the leopard, and exact what is yours by right and by oath.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With that, she turned back to the fire, and seemed to slowly vanish into the shadows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The lovers looked at each other again, and both felt a sense of purpose settling into place, interlinking with the sorrow and anger and loss, binding them all together and into a common purpose.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">.It seems we are geas bound., Sammi spoke softly, yet Jemima could hear the sharp edge of purpose in her voice, .and who are we to argue with the gods?..</p>

<p class="regtxt5">.Who indeed., Jemima responded, as they rose together and walked hand in hand to the door, out into the midnight darkness, and onto the footpath to the great terminus.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p class="regtxt5">More notes:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When they get to the station they find loads of people waiting by the longest platform, and stacks of strange weapons (mixed types, mostly assault-rifle like with a few rocket types and more essoteric (magic)
stuff).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A shunting (switching) engine hauls Kali's train in.  Kali herself is turning Leopardess on the triangular junction of the branch to face outwards before backing down onto the train.  She was the figure who slipped out early, and ran all the way to the Cathouse siding to prepare the loco, she's already been fueled and watered at Temple Heath, more water will be taken on at Portal Station on the way out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The old woman is of course the figure from the alley, and it will turn out almost everyone had an encounter with her that night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Kali backs Leopardess down onto the train, the old woman will appear again at the signal at the end of the platform, whether she rides in the cab or not is up to you (well, you and Kali!).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They all know the mission itself is "safe" in as much as none of them will die, but as they're straying into the Demon Realms they will witness horror, including in some cases the very things they fled to Eternia to avoid.  Vengance they'll have too, esp as their goddess is Lady Vengance herself, but while appreciating the overall fairness of what they do, the slaughtering doesn't come easy.  In addition, they'll have to kill some of their own, who survived the original disaster but were taken by the demons for torture, if they're too far gone to save.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The guy who set up the sacred unit fleet will put in an appearance too, also taking revenge for what was a gross violation of the Universal Balance.  He'll take one demon for each innocent slain, and as he has no weapons at all, it's all done by running them down.  He's driving the original unit of the fleet he saved, and by the time he's done his work, the leading coach is green to the roof in demon ochre, and to sensitives, will ever after have a faint trace of that colour superimposed over the paintwork.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anyway, what do you think?  Does this fit with your plans?  I'll not attempt to write any of the Kali bits, just S&J and their friends experiences, plus some of the general train-handling stuff.  As this is a very hastily put together revenge trip, and has lots of regular death city people as well as Kali's crew on board, they'll be packed into the coaches with barely space to lie on the floors, but somehow they all fit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thoughts?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">PS: Note I've now set up a seperate address - anything you send to storytellers@stormshadow.com will go into a dedicated folder, with two subfolders, "Archive" and "Needing Answers".  So now I've no excuse for not answering you!  It will also help me focus, and keep track of what's where.</p>
