<p class="sectioncaption">Merris Visits</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A wrought iron trellis with wild climbing roses intwined through it, arched over the rusting gate. A wandering path of oddly shaped stones crossed the short distance from the gate to a door into the building. Two small flower beds bracketed the door. Night blooming lillies and other stange plants grew in the carefully tended beds. The door itself was a sculture of fantastic animals and beings set into the block stone of the old warehouse building. "Looks like the shadow woman isn't as colorless as we thought," Merris commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Teresa gave Merris a mildly annoyed look as she opened the door. Inside a wrought iron spiral staircase led up. Its treads were age blackened oak and the railing was twisted rose vine and red, purple, and black cut glass flowers. It emerged into a large room carved out of the second level of the warehouse. On a small table attached to the top of the stair rail was a small white board and markers. In the distance a shower was running. "I'm back and I brought Merris." Teresa turned back to Merris, "Now she knows we are here. Otherwise she might come out without checking."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Looking around the room Merris saw an old couch crouched near a small stove. In a far corner several computers hummed quietly. a three panel monitor setup dominated a small desk. The outside windows were covered with an inner layer of stained glass. The patterns on the long side of the room were heavy with Heironymous Bosch painting style creatures and roses. The stain glass over the windows on the short sides were Egyptian motifs. Most of the inside walls were covered in book shelves. Ornate rugs covered the scarred warehouse flooring in front of the couch and near the desk. A battered grey laptop with the gold mud flap girl on it rested on an arm of the couch. An overstuffed chair faced the couch across a heavy glass and ironwork table. A small battered black laptop rested on the seat. Most of the ilumination came from strategically placed candle holders. On a wall next to the computer desk was an enormous white board. Most of it was covered with notes and diagrams of characters and plots. The lower right corner was marked off with double red lines and a caption above it read 'Talking Place'.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The shadow woman emerged from a back area with a towel around her head and wearing her characteristic baggy clothes. With a curious glance at Merris she settled into the couch. Teresa picked up the laptop in the chair and flipped it open as the shadow woman did the same. For a few moments there was only the klicking of keys. "She would like to know why you are here," Teresa said after a few minutes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait, are you Messaging her? Across the table?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, we are. It's faster than the white boards. Now, what did you need to ask?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Teresa set her laptop aside and stood. She walked quickly over to the desk, opened a drawer and pulled out another black laptop. She handed it to Merris with a small smile, "Log in as 'GuestTalker', password 'H3lloW0rld'. Her screen name is DancerOfShadows. It'll be faster than my translating between the two of you. My screen name is AlphaTeresa if you need to include me for any reason."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* thoughts on <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/kali.htm">Kali</a> */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have the what of her now. The energy that scares the fuck out of me burns bright in her. She is restless and animated. The demons and angels dance just below her skin and move her in ways I never could. She is the dancer, still crazy but with an outlet that centers her. More, even, than the writing centers me. The energy buzzes in me as well, yet i am too afraid to follow it. Always so afraid...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This place is good for me. I am allowed the shadows. I don't have to stand out, be somebody, strive to get ahead. I can slip from task to task, help from the darkness, and hide when it gets to be too much. There is safety here, at last. It has been of great comfort to never speak, to cling to the silence and only write to talk. Only Kali has seen the truth. I could not hide it from her. It would not have been fair.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It will out-live me of course. I am but a part of it now. All is finally as it should be.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* thoughts on theatre organ */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shadow woman somehow needs to hear about the theatre organ. she will volunteer to make it work. either by updating and making it work or by restoring it to original condition if desired. <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/belladonna.htm">Beth</a> will be the one she talks to and she will ask that it be made to work. she is fine with the concept of updates and will request that a couple of additional stops be added so she can remote some of her other keyboards to the manuals on the organ console.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* after the end */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They were all gathered at the Temple Heath table. An empty chair was pulled up with a glass of Murphy's Impirial for their fallen comrade. They were swapping stories of her. Every so often they would fall silent and raise another glass to her. As the evening wore on they started to ask more and more often why it had to have been her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the shadows I sat and typed. She had been everything I had wanted to be and yet it hadn't been enough. In ungarded moments I could see the sick dread and the insane restlessness eating away behind her eyes. She went to her end never understanding that she meant as much to her friends as they did to her. Silently I lifted the last of my wine to the empty place and thought, "To you, Kali."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I saved the last of the file, closed the laptop, placed it in my bag and stood. Keeping to the shadows I slipped silently from the Adam and Eve. It was easy to glide through the dark to the Skull and Bones Brewery. I let myself in through the loading dock door. Flipping on only a couple of lights, I crossed to my locker and started to pull on the heavy rubber rain gear, paused, then stripped off the rain gear and the rest of my clothes.  I grabbed the battered music player out of my pack, strapped it onto my arm and shoved the ear pieces into my ears. The last fermenter stood waiting for me. I shoved the hose and brushes in, pulled myself up in after, and pushed start on the player. As the sounds of Love's Bitch throbbed in my headphones I began to clean, tunelessly screaming out the words to my favorite songs.</p>
