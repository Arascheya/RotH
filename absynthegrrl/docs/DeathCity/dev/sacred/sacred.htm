<P>Stylish and attractive, these Class 303 Electric Multiple Units
revolutionised train services in the Glasgow area when they took over from steam
in 1960. They were fast, reliable, comfortable, and had a unique feature - the
passengers could see through the drivers cab and share the panoramic view of the
route ahead.

<P>This is the centre car of the three coach train, which housed all the main
electrical gear, including the twenty five thousand volt pantograph pickup (on
the roof at the far end in this view), and the four 207hp motors.
<P>Sadly, this "preserved" example, 303 048, which was restored to original
condition in the early 1990s, has since been scrapped, while the few remaining
units in service have all been "refurbished", which is railwayspeak for having
their interior ripped out and replaced by one based on the "Designed By A
Committee With A Grudge" 1979 stock. This included boarding up the forward view.
