<p class="pagecaption">Various Train Configurations</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are a few cars that are optional depending on the mission and the crew roster.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1 - <a href="d_rollingstock.htm#kali">Kali's company car</a> - contains her suite, kitchen, and common room - in lead unit</p>
<p class="regtxt9">1 - optional - <a href="d_rollingstock.htm#dementia">Dementia's company car</a> - contains her suite, kitchen, and common room. this car is only attached when Dementia is part of the team</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Single Train Configuration</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The single train configuration listed below would work, however it produces a train that is almost a mile in length.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Kali as leader, 16 team leaders, 158 additional personnel plus several that show up as needed</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Class K-666 locomotives - 3</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Rolling Stock</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 - additional tender to carry more fuel and water</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 - <a href="d_rollingstock.htm#kali">Kali's company car</a> - contains her suite, kitchen, and common room</p>
<p class="regtxt12">8 - 2 person company cars for team leads, contains team meeting room, team lead quarters, and small kitchen facilities</p>
<p class="regtxt12">16 - 10 person sleeper cars - one per team</p>
<p class="regtxt12">2 dining/food service</p>
<p class="regtxt12">4 misc support - food/water stores, laundry, generators for additional power for cars</p>
<p class="regtxt12">2 armory</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 empty 10 person sleeper - can be used for extracted personnel and is equipped to function as a field hospital if needed</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 empty 5 person sleeper - can be used for extracted personnel and is equipped to function as a field hospital if needed, also used by sometimes participants such as Dementia and others</p>
<p class="regtxt12">6 equipment - can carry some recovered items with re-packing</p>
<p class="regtxt12">2 flat cars - with mobile heavy equipment</p>
<p class="regtxt12">2 heavy armored cars - can be used for sensitive recovered items, rescued personnel, etc.</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 - optional - <a href="d_rollingstock.htm#dementia">Dementia's company car</a> - contains her suite, kitchen, and common room. this car is only attached when Dementia is part of the team</p>
<p class="regtxt12">total stock - 46/47</p>
</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">Four Train Configuration</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Second configuration thoughts. In this concept there are four trains, each consisting of 4 teams. This allows a better tailoring of the response team and allows multiple responses at the same time. Kali would go with the most serious or dangerous and send the other trains out on the other missions.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Each Unit</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 K-666 (1)</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 spare tender</p>
<p class="regtxt12">2 - 2 person company cars for team leads, contains team meeting room, team lead quarters, and small kitchen facilities</p>
<p class="regtxt12">4 - 10 person sleeper cars - one per team</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 dining/food service</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 misc support - food/water stores, laundry, generators for additional power for cars</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 armory</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 empty 10 person sleeper - can be used for extracted personnel and is equipped to function as a field hospital if needed</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 empty 5 person sleeper - can be used for extracted personnel and is equipped to function as a field hospital if needed, also used by sometimes participants such as Dementia and others</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 equipment - can carry some recovered items with re-packing</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 flat car - with mobile heavy equipment</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 heavy armored car - can be used for sensitive recovered items, rescued personnel, etc.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">for a total of 15 or 16 cars, easily handled by a K-666
also giving a more manageable train length of: 1500 ft per unit</p>
</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">Train per Team Configuration</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is a third configuration for the rare times when more than four trains are needed. In this configuration each team has a train of its own. This is the last configuration developed because it requires many more drivers to support.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Each Unit</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 K-666 (1)</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 spare tender</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 - 2 person company cars for team leads, contains team meeting room, team lead quarters, and small kitchen facilities</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 - 10 person sleeper cars - one per team</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 dining/food service</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 misc support - food/water stores, laundry, generators for additional power for cars</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 armory</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 empty 10 person sleeper - can be used for extracted personnel and is equipped to function as a field hospital if needed</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 empty 5 person sleeper - can be used for extracted personnel and is equipped to function as a field hospital if needed, also used by sometimes participants such as Dementia and others</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 equipment - can carry some recovered items with re-packing</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 flat car - with mobile heavy equipment</p>
<p class="regtxt12">1 heavy armored car - can be used for sensitive recovered items, rescued personnel, etc.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">for a total of 11 or 12 cars, easily handled by a K-666
also giving a more manageable train length of: 1200 ft per unit</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Notes:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">(1) There are some drivers that prefer diesel electric locomotives. In their case they will substitute units necessary to pull the train they are taking.</p>
