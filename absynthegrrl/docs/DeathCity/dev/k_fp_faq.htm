<p class="pagecaption">First Period FAQ</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hi. Welcome to the Q and A part of the site. Here's a chance to get answers to your questions without actually having to ask them out loud. There's also a list of other resources at the end of the section. If you're still thirsting for knowledge, talk with a parent, teacher or other trusted adult.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When will I get my first period?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Good question. Most girls get their first period between the ages of 9 and 16. Most means the majority - not everyone will fall into this category. Anyway, it follows the development of breasts, hips, waist, pubic hair, and a growth spurt. Put those clues together and they usually add up to imminent period alert. In addition, a girl will often weigh at least 100 pounds before menstruation begins. Genetics also plays a role. If possible, find out when your mom got her first period to get an estimate of when yours may arrive.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What will happen when I get my first period?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Usually a first period is very light. It will probably be a few spots of bright red blood or a brown sticky stain that shows up on your underpants. If you are out in public and don't have a pad with you, don't panic. Remain calm. This is a time when true female bonding occurs. Hopefully, your mother or other adult relative will be close by and can supply you with a feminine product. If not, try Plan B. Ask a friend or other woman if she has a pad. It's a well-kept secret that every woman at some time in her life has had to ask another woman for a pad. Yes, it's embarrassing, but you can rely on other women to see you through this situation. And in all honesty, first periods were designed really well because it is usually so little that it won't seep through to your outer clothes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">How long will my period last?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Everyone is different. It can last between two and seven days. Most girls have it for about five days.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What should I do when I get my first period?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In addition to what's covered above, it's a good idea to have feminine products ready for that first period, and to know how to use them. (See the Kotex products section of our site for more information about these products.)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What if I get my period at school?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">If you have a pad with you, go to the girls' room and put it on. If you don't have one, go to the school nurse, the office, or wherever you can get a pad. How about keeping a pad at school in case of emergency? If you don't need it, maybe one of your friends will and she can return the favor some day soon.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What if my flow is really heavy and I have to use lots of pads?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It's probably just a heavy flow, which can happen during a period's first day or two. Some girls normally experience a heavy flow. If you have a prolonged heavy flow, call your doctor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Will I have to stop activities such as sports when I have my period?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">No. These days it's hard to use a period as an excuse to get out of gym class. Believe it or not, the more active you are, the less likely you are to have cramps. And, if you're worried about leaking during sports activities, check out the Kotex products section of the website to find out how to help prevent leaks by using a pad or tampon that fits you and your period.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">How often will I get my period?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Cycles range anywhere between 21 to 45 days. The average is 28 days. At first, it will probably be irregular. The time between when you get it, the length and time you have it, and the amount of flow will all vary. As your body finds its own internal rhythm, your period will settle into a pattern. It can take a year or two. Mark your periods on a calendar to get used to following your cycle.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Can I go swimming when I have my period?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Yes, but don't wear a pad. It will swell up like an inflatable raft. If you want to swim, you should wear a tampon. But first, talk it over with your parent or other responsible adult before trying this (the tampon, not the swimming).</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Please see Questions and Answers about Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). Or, check out Important Information about Toxic Shock Syndrome.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Can I take a bath when I have my period?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Yes. In fact, a bath or a shower is really important at this time to keep you clean and to fight off any odors that may occur.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Will getting my period hurt?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The actually bleeding part doesn't hurt. The menstrual cramps are uncomfortable but manageable.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What do cramps feel like?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You've probably already guessed this, but cramps don't feel good. Cramps are a pain. And they're particularly a pain around the area of the uterus that is below your belly button. Sometimes they lodge in your lower back. Cramps are caused by the uterus contracting. You can get them just before and during your period. Some girls have a few cramps, some have lots, and then there are those who have none. The intensity of the cramps varies, and you may not get them every time you have your period. They can be managed with over the counter pain relief medication. Ask your doctor for more information.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What is menstruation, anyway?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This is strictly a biological explanation so hold on. Menstruation is your monthly opportunity to create a baby. When your body first becomes able to produce a child, usually between the ages of 9 and 16, it begins preparation once a month for possible motherhood. This time in your life is known as menarche ("muh-NAE-key"). A tiny egg matures in one of your ovaries, then travels down a fallopian tube toward your uterus. Your uterus, meanwhile, has been preparing for the egg's arrival, and its lining has gotten thick and velvety. If the arriving egg is fertilized by a sperm, your uterus is all set to protect and nourish the developing baby for the next nine months. If the egg doesn't get fertilized - because there is no sperm present, then your uterus has no use for that thick, spongy lining. So it sheds the lining and flushes it out - along with some blood, body fluids, and the disintegrated egg. For 2 to 6 days each month, all this stuff flows out of your body through your vagina as reddish-brown menstrual flow. After the onset of menstruation, you'll usually have a menstrual period about every 28 days (except during pregnancy) although your cycle may vary anywhere from 20 to 35 days. Flash forward about 40 years, when your body enters menopause. Your ovaries stop producing eggs and your periods stop.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What does it mean if my period is late or irregular?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Irregular periods for the first couple of years are normal. But, after that, when you've started to menstruate regularly, missing a period may be a sign of pregnancy (if you are sexually active). Other causes of irregularity include a change in diet, increase in exercise or drug use. The best advice is to chat with your health care provider if you're concerned.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Will other people know I'm having my period?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When you're having your period, you don't want the world to know. Regular bathing, proper use of pads and/or tampons and loose, comfortable clothes are a good strategy to keep your period from sticking out in a crowd.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Why do I feel crabby and sad right before my period?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">PMS. Those three little letters pack a punch, don't they? Moodiness, anxiety and depression are all part of premenstrual syndrome's big bag o' tricks. Again, some women don't get PMS and no guy on the planet "gets" PMS. So if you're suffering with headaches, backaches, pimples, nausea and food cravings, call a friend, the kind who will understand, and talk about it. She may have some advice on ways to find relief. Or, visit "lets talk" to chat with other girls who might be going through the same thing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What causes PMS and why do I feel so darn fat?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">PMS symptoms are caused by hormonal changes that take place prior to menstruation. As hormone levels even out, PMS symptoms gradually disappear. The emotions and problems that seemed overwhelming suddenly feel manageable. Get to know your cycle and you will know when to head off PMS.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As for the "fat thing." Here's the skinny. Just before and during your period, your body tends to retain water. This added fluid might make you feel bloated or your breasts feel tender. It's normal to gain a couple pounds during this time of the month - and ditch them when your period is over. If you feel like a water balloon, pull on some loose, comfortable clothing. Don't even think about using a pair of pliers to pull up the zipper on your favorite jeans. It's not worth the discomfort. Avoiding salt immediately before and during your period is also a good idea. Salt increases water retention.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What if I bleed through my clothes?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ick. Ick. Ick. And it has happened to almost every woman. First step is damage control. Tie a sweater or jacket around your waist or untuck your shirt. If that's not an option, have a good friend walk directly behind you on the way to the bathroom. Find the closest tampon or pad. When you get to the bathroom, check to see if you can blot out any noticeable spots. If it's a hopeless situation, take a trip to the nurse's office and see if someone can bring you a change of clothes from home. If you are at work or out shopping, try to call it a day and head home. Soaking your underwear or other clothes in cold water and using a stain remover can usually get out any blood stains. O.k., now an important word about preventing this from ever, ever, ever happening again. Being proactive can keep this from being a worst-day-ever type of situation. In the future, stash an extra pair of underwear in your locker and wear dark clothes on days when you're expecting your period or when your flow is at its heaviest. Plan on changing your feminine product on a regular basis. Don't wait until it's too late because you're busy. Wear the right product for your flow.

<p class="regtxt5">Don't get me wrong, Scott's a sweetie and just adorable, but it's still a little odd to have a man other than Master poking about down there. But his professional demeanor really helped to put us both at ease, and shortly I was marked with a dot at the center of my clitoris (as a sort of "aiming device", I understand), swabbed down with antimicrobial cleaner, and getting ready to have a pair of forceps applied to me. This was not, as you can imagine, terribly pleasant, but the forceps were really not THAT tight, and they didn't have "teeth" like some do, so it certainly wasn't as bad as I'd feared.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Unfortunately, the rest of it...was worse. I won't lie to make you feel better about considering this piercing; you'd just get mad and come shoot me later. IT HURT!!!! I remember very clearly Scott's telling me the importance of the deep breath right before the piercing; it helps with the circulation of the endorphins and apparently kills the pain sooner. But all I could think, as he aligned the needle with my clit, was that as soon as I started to let out a breath, I was going to be in some serious pain. And for a few moments, I very nearly backed out. I remember whimpering "I don't think I can do this!" while clutching Master's hand in a death-grip. But then I had to calm myself down...I didn't want to let myself down by not doing what I'd come here to do. I didn't want to let Master down after he took the day off work to take me in to get pierced. And in an odd way, I didn't want to let Scott down by making him think I didn't trust him. (Yes, the man is just that nice. One hour in his company and I was worried about hurting his feelings.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So when he asked in a concerned voice if I wanted him to stop, I somehow found the words to say no, go on. So I took the deep breath, began to let it out, and then I started to scream. I can honestly say this was the worst pain I have ever experienced, ladies. I'm sorry. I screamed when the needle went into me, I screamed louder when it hit the denser tissue at the base of my clitoris, and then I screamed some more when it popped back out the other side. It felt like I'd died and gone to Hell, and it seemed neverending.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And then...it stopped. Scott was done, the ring was in, and we had entered what he called "halftime", in which he lets the piercee rest and collect himself/herself for a few moments before the ring is bent and the ball fitted into it. I remember thinking quite clearly, "Huh? Where'd the pain go?" Not that I missed it, of course, but it was very strange, the sudden and total absence of what I would have SWORN was the worst agony known to womankind. Shortly thereafter, of course, the endorphin rush kicked in and I had the nicest little float in "sub-space"...the whole thing would almost have been worth it just for that.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And you know what? In reality, the piercing was over in about two seconds. There was a slight tugging as Scott fitted the ball into the ring and got it looking all nice and pretty, but it actually felt pretty erotic rather than painful. And then he handed me a mirror so I could look at my new "toy". Ladies, I've never been particularly enthused with the view of my own vulva, but I have to say, this piercing is truly beautiful. It's now about four hours later, and I'm sitting at my computer desk occasionally tightening up my vaginal muscles just a little to have some activity there, because the feeling of the ring inside my clit is wonderful. There is no pain, although I'm aware of the jewelry every time I move, and really even when I sit still. I can almost feel my heartbeat against it!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So would I do it again? Oh, yes. I'm going to try very hard to take good care of this piercing so I don't have to, but I definitely would do it again, and I do recommend it. It's the most erotic little piece of jewelry you'd ever want to find, and it's my own little secret.</p>
