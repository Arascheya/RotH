<p class="pagecaption">Extraction Team</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Group of trouble-shooters, warriors that go in to assist other Eternia teams that are under attack by demonic or other forces. This is a very recent kind of Eternia group. At first it wasn't even an organized group, rather just a list of people and assets that could be pulled when needed. As the incursions became more concentrated and common it was formalized. This was about the time <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/kali.htm">Kali</a> was rising to prominence in the group. She ended up becoming the leader as much from no one else wanting it as anything else.</p>
