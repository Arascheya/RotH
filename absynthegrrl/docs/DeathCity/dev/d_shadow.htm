<p class="pagecaption">Shadow Walkers</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At their simplest Shadow Walkers are those who have come to Death City without passing trhrough the transition of death. Typically however they have other things in common as well. Typical Shadow Walkers are not seekers of attention. They are restless spirits, whether is shows in outward action or not. something is always worrying at them, driving them to a distracted restlessness that often gets on the nerves of those around them. Often if you ask them what they are seeking they would not be able to tell you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Many regular Death City arrivals pity the Shadow Walkers because even in Death City many of the Walkers don't seem to find the happiness they should.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shadow Walkers can return to the Realms as desired and interact easily with the dinizens there. This is very useful for scouting out new recruits or when information is needed from a Realm location that is not suitable for a rescue mission. It is also one of the ways the items of beauty are delivered back to the Realms. Shadow Walkers can die the real death when on a mission for Death City. At this point they once again have the option of remaining in Death City as a regular resident or going on to the realm of whatever deity they believe in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Walkers are seen by those of the Realms while the Dead typically are not. The Dead are only seen by possible new recruits or very rare and highly sensitive persons in the Realms.</p>
