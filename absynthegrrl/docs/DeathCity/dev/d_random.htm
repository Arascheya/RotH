<p class="regtxt5">"Did you know Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I knew of her. Everyone here did. Some say she started as just another recruit, others say she was an avatar of the Lady herself, and still others think she was both. No one knows for certain. Those of her friends that are left refuse to speak of her background."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are those who claim she still lives. Have you heard that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who hasn't. I was there at the last, though. The grief of those that knew her was real. I very much doubt the rumors."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What of Katya at the Devil's Cathouse? It's said she dances like Kali did, if you can get her to dance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Katya? Which one is she?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* LOCATIONS - add for background and the like */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Goth City</p>

<p class="regtxt9">homeless people sleeping and living in the park, most noticeable at night when their fires can be seen</p>
