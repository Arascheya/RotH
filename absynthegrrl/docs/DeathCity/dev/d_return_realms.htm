<p class="regtxt5">Merris stared as Kali came down the stairs from her bedroom. She was dressed in a long skirt of black crushed velvet, a black velvet vest over an emerald green silk shirt with puffed and pleated sleeves. High black button up boots, a dark purple bag, and a heavy black cape with purple lining completed the ensemble. She wore a large silver ankh suspended from a heavy silver chain. Large hoop earrings with tiny skulls dangling from them peeked out from the riot of her red hair. Dark red lipstick outlined in black and heavy black eye makeup washed out her naturally healthy color. "Wow! You are so hot in that! I can hardly wait for your return."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali took a long shuddering breath, "you know, somehow this doesn't seem as good an idea as it did half an hour ago. I’m used to hiding by keeping to the shadows, not hiding by being out in the open."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Confidence issues?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Very much so!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Remember, you've survived rescue missions, learned to drive steam engines, and are designing your own engine. if you can do that, you can play a goth girl in the realms for a few days."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I have always heard hidden in plain sight. If they notice anything odd about me it will be the way I dress and move. With luck that will be all they notice."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris moved to her, hugged her close and kissed her deeply. "It'll be fine. Are you still sure you can’t do this from here? Extractions from that world aren’t the easiest to arrange."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’m sure, sadly they don’t have any of their documents or drawings online. All their site says is serious researchers only. I think I managed to get an interview, I just hope it’s enough to get access."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was midnight once more and he should have already been at work. Walking quickly Tom thought he heard a train whistle in the distance, but it couldn’t have been he told himself. No trains had come through town in 20 years. With a shake of his head he turned down a side street a couple of blocks before the old station and didn’t see the shadow of an old steam locomotive pull into it. In recent years the station had been converted into shops and a small museum. A figure stepped lightly from the single coach. Half turning she said, "I'll send a message when it is time to pick me up. This is one of the places with an extensive railroad documents collection."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Moving quietly the figure slipped away from the train and around the closed building. Quickly she headed down the street following directions half remembered from the map site she had called up before leaving Death City. She turned down the same street Tom had gone down just minutes before. Up ahead was the Cleveland Hotel where she hoped to find rooms. It was only three blocks from the Rail Center Archives where she hoped to find the data she needed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tom had just moved to the desk when the street door opened and a woman walked in. At first he only glanced up to see if it might be a customer, then he looked again as she registered on him. Goth would be the best way to describe her. He stared as she said, "Good evening good sir. Might you have a room available for one such as I this fine night?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Yes, yes we do."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her boots scarcely made a sound as she seemed to glide over to the desk. She set a carpet style bag done in dusty rose patterns. "I should like to reserve the best you have for three nights. How much will you require for this boon?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This boon, um, the room is one hundred fifty dollars a night." She flipped her cape back, reached into a dark purple velvet bag, and drew out a small group of bills held together with a spider web money clip. She pulled the amount from the wad and set them on the counter. "We prefer credit cards for payment." He shrugged apologetically, "Company policy I’m afraid, sorry..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I am too," she replied as she allowed him a glance at the wad still in the clip. Then she picked up the money and turned to go. "I had heard this was a good place to stay while in town. Might you recommend some place where the rules aren’t quite so strict?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She waited a moment before heading toward the door. Just as she reached it he made up his mind. "Um, it’s ok. You can stay here. Just please don’t let my manager know."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She sketched a slight curtsey his way and replied, "Thank you good sir." Silently she returned to the counter and once more laid out the money. This time there was a sizeable extra amount accidentally left in the stack. She waved it away carelessly when he tried to return it. "Now, if you could recommend a good place to find refreshment my evening would be complete."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’d offer you the room service menu but we’ve been closing the kitchen between 10 and 6 in the morning. There’s not much open this time of day other than some of the sports bars." He nodded at her slightly curled lip. "Yeah, I know, not everyone is into that. There’s an all night food chain place eight blocks from here, but it won’t be very good." While he talked he pulled out a key from under the desk and set it on the counter. "I put you in the presidential suite. It’s said one of the presidents actually stayed here one campaign. If you could just fill in this guest card please."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She scanned it and wrote in the data she had created for the purpose. "Seattle huh? They dress like you there?" He asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Some do, some even more extreme. You should go there some time."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I’d love to. Join a band maybe... But it won’t happen with what I make here. If there’s anything you need, don’t hesitate to ring. You have a good night, Kali," he said, glancing at her name on the card. "Isn’t that some Hindu goddess or something?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes..." she answered hesitantly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Cool! How'd you end up with it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"My mom was kind of a new age freak. She picked it out and my father couldn't have cared less."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's pretty. I like it. Would you like me to show you where the room is?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, I think I can find it, thanks. You could tell me how to find the state archive building though. I'm headed there for some research tomorrow. Family history kinds of things for my mom, kind of a birthday gift."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, neat! It's really easy." He quickly narrated the way. In a few moments she was in the elevator headed for the top floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need to add some difficulties - probably gaining access and then getting proper copies of the docs she needs */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* need complications at Strasburg as well */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* force to Eddystone? try and recover something from the wreckage before destruction */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* maybe something she overhears or sees at Strasburg lets her know about the pull-down - this could be a quick recovery mission - get what can be gotten before the pull-down */</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">story segment - Love's Bitch plays Whitby Goth Festival</p>
<p class="regtxt5">concept is similar to IS playing at Adam and Eve - arrive by train with IS and open for them. Anne and her current show up and recognize the tattoo on Kali's back when she is finishing up as "roadie" for LB, talks to her about "stealing" Kali's tattoo image, the band members give her away when they call her for food, Anne talks to her after the show also?</p>
