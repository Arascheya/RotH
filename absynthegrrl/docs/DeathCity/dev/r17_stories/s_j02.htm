<p class="regtxt5">The Ruins Of Derithos - Sammi & Jemima Chapter 2.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima awoke to the sound of wheelbeats, the regular rhythmic clickety-clack, clickety-clack, familiar and reassuring, as the leading bogie of the 1950's coach rode over the rail joints.  Through the compartment window she could see the stars flashing past, as the train sped on through the eternal void.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Beside her, sprawled out beneath the satin sheets, lay her lover Sammi, dressed in a loose t-shirt and cycling shorts.  Jemima herself wore a light jumpsuit - experience had taught them both that sometimes lovemaking went better with clothes than without!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Turning her head, Jemima gazed at Sammi's sleeping face, her eyes delighting again in the shorter woman's fine features, tracing the line of her aristocratic cheekbones, lingering longingly on the lips, relaxed now, smiling slightly in her sleep.  Abruptly the train hit a patch of rough track, the carriage rocked slightly on it's bogies, Sammi sighed gently, her smile widened, and though she still slept she reached for Jemima.  The taller woman was only too happy to oblige, snuggling down beside her lover, throwing an arm casually over her back and gently kissing her nose.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lying there, warm and snug with the one person she needed above all others, Jemima considered what she had done.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She realised there could be no going back, deep down she had known that from the moment Sammi's note arrived, the fact that she had been ushered onto this train by Lady Death herself had just confirmed to her reason what her inner self had known all along.  With a smile she wondered what the churchmen who had so lambasted her relationship would make of all this - after all, their bibles didn't exactly say anything about speeding through the eternal void in a luxury train!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She snuggled in a bit closer to Sammi, and kissed her again.  Sammi writhed a little, and finally woke up. "Bright Greetings, Lover!", she said with a grin, pulling Jemima tight to her and wrapping her lithe legs around the taller woman's.  Jemima hugged Sammi back, their lips met, and for a moment they lost themselves in the kiss, their souls blending in ecstasy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Eventually it ended, and they pulled apart just a little, and lay gazing into each others eyes.  After a while Sammi spoke, "How do you like our new home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's magic", Jemima replied, "I suppose I should have a whole stack of questions, but somehow I just know we're in the right place, so I'll take whatever comes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, come on", Sammi teased her friend, "There must be something you want to know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well", Jemima thought for a moment, "I don't suppose there's much point in asking where this train is going, but", she broke off, unsure about whether she had any right to ask, "if you don't mind talking about it - I - can you tell me what they did to you, after..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Relax", Sammi hugged her tightly for a moment, "relax.  You were right about the gangs taking me, my own fault really, I tried to chase a dealer from the school gates on my own - ran straight into an ambush.  They got a sack over me, and just piled on the bodies till I went down.  They beat me up a bit, chucked me in the back of a van and drove me down to the old coal wharf - where that disused line we followed comes out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The coal wharf - I told the police to look there, but they said no-one could get down there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No one can, not unless they know about the old wagonway tunnel from the back of Atlas Lane, and that's the gang's best guarded secret"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What happened, once they got you down there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They had everything set for a standard execution, chains, concrete, the lot.  I knew there was no way out, but somehow I didn't feel too bad about it". Sammi relaxed as she told the tale, "Would you believe I even enjoyed being covered in concrete!", she giggled at that, and hugged Jemima again, "they poured it all over my jeans, it felt wonderfully cold and heavy". She grew serious again, "The only thing that hurt was knowing I was leaving you alone." Jemima pulled Sammi close at that, curling herself around the shorter woman like a shield. "Anyway", Sammi continued, after a pause, "there I was, wrapped in old chains, legs covered in quick drying concrete, all set for my last soaking, when I heard a rumble in the distance.  The gang heard it too, and hurried to push me in the canal, but something stopped them. All the time there was this growing roar coming from the disused tunnel, then, suddenly, the scene changed, all the old rails, signals, even the signal box, reappeared from nowhere.  Remember how you pictured it, when we walked down there?" Jemima nodded, recalling how she'd been able to picture almost exactly where the various lines had been, even imagining a steam powered freight coming down the fast line to the docks. "Well that's exactly how it was, but with this train we're on now where you saw the freight.  You should have seen the looks on the gang's faces - they were seeing a ghost!  Remember Billy the Tyrant?" Jemima nodded, well remembering the sadistic dealer they had crossed paths with before. "Well, that's one piece of scum that won't be coming back", Sammi grinned as she remembered what had happened next, "He stood like a man transfixed, just stood there, one foot each side of a rail, while the train rolled closer and closer.  They'd been storming on the branch, now they were screeching towards me with the brake hard on, sparks pouring from the bogies - still he didn't move, good old No 55 ran straight over him, his right arm snagged for a moment on the coupling hook, then he went under, the leading bogie sliced him in half."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good riddance", Jemima surprised herself, normally Sammi had been the "death to bad guys" advocate, but this time even she agreed with the penalty Billy had paid.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, there I was, all set for the last plunge into the deep blue, and they came and rescued me!"  Sammi indicated the coach around them, "And now you're here too.  I was given that option, to ask you to join me, when I was chosen." They hugged each other anew. "I must admit", Sammi continued, "I was worried about you, especially the day you went off around all our old haunts - I was terrified that you were going to commit suicide on me, and that would have wrecked everything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I did think about it", Jemima responded to the gentle question, "but when I sat by the mainline and watched the expresses roar past, somehow I felt that you wanted me to live, so I went to all our other places, and tried to remember you alive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't know how much that means to me", Sammi answered her, "Did you know you were being watched?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No", Jemima was surprised, she had been alert for the drug dealers coming after her as well as Sammi, "And here I thought I was being careful!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here on the Metro we have special methods", Sammi grinned at her, "Didn't you meet a tall, long haired bloke occasionally?" Jemima remembered the attractive man who had offered to take her home after her mud bath, and described him to Sammi. "That's the one - he's a driver up here, drives a Swindon built Diesel Multiple Unit.  He's got some special equipment, he can take that unit through the cyber realms, as well as dropping into "real space" almost anywhere - He keeps an eye on what goes on below.  I had him watch out for you".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The lovers talked for a while more, relaxing in each others arms, before sleep claimed them once again.  All the while the mighty Deltic locomotive thundered on, accelerating far beyond the speed of light. On through the void they sped, the driver exulting in the power of his machine, hammering past stations and signal boxes long vanished from the physical world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tirelessly, indefatigably, the locomotive roared onwards, it's driver burning out his own deep sorrow beneath the thundering wheels - but then that is another tale, the telling of which does not belong here. Suffice to say, somewhere out in the eternal void, 55055 drew near yet another signal box, the ancient semaphores of Weaver Junction materialising before the speeding machinery.  Here was a difference, for the signals indicated the train being switched onto a diverging line, swinging across the high speed crossovers smoothly, still at full power, a faint lurch as the bogies pounded over the joints, then again that steady thunder as she settled onto the new route. Somewhere ahead, another call awaited, another balance of the universe to be tended by the crew of the Death City Metropolitan.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This time Sammi & Jemmia awoke together, called from slumber by a subtle difference in the train's motion.  The distant locomotive still roared its song of power, yet something subtle had changed.  Sammi kissed Jemima on the nose, then bounded out of bed and stuck her head out of the window.  Looking forwards, long hair rippling behind her in the slipstream, she searched the void for a sign of their destination. Suddenly a signal post appeared, Sammi activated a keypad by the window as she sped towards the next signal box, pulling her head back in as the train roared past the little structure.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima stretched, and looked expectantly up at her as Sammi read the screen above the keypad. "Time to earn our keep?", she said, as Sammi turned towards her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You've got it", Sammi opened a wardrobe and began to dress in her usual style, cotton shorts and t-shirt under faded jeans and a denim shirt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima slipped her lithe figure from the bed, allowing the lightweight jumpsuit to fall to her ankles before stepping up to join her lover. "What should I wear", she said, as Sammi took her naked body in her arms and pulled her close for a moment, "I mean, what exactly do we have to do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're going to Derithos", Sammi answered, "You'd probably best dress like me, they've been fighting a civil war for years, if we're going that means it's just gone nuclear.  You can expect to do a lot of scrambling about in ruins, collecting stuff - that's how this system operates, we 'rescue' things that are about to be destroyed".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Things' like you?," Jemima grinned at Sammi.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I suppose you could say that", the shorter woman grinned back, as Jemima shrugged herself into an outfit identical to Sammi's own.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All of a sudden, the sound of the locomotive faded as the driver shut off power, then came a hiss of vacuum from beneath their coach, followed by a deep throated rumble from the bogies as the brake came on.  Fighting the heavy deceleration, the two women sat on the edge of their bed to pull on matching black workboots.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Another hiss, and the brakes bit harder.  Abruptly, daylight flooded the compartment as the train dropped into the "real space" of the doomed planet of Derithos.  There was an almighty wrench, as the wheels engaged in the real track of a real line, then they ran smoothly on, still slowing.  Sammi led Jemima out of the compartment to the drop-light window in an outside door at the end of the corridor, lowering it, they both leaned out to see this alien world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Devastation met their gaze, a rural landscape ruined by war, shattered buildings, broken bridges, fire ravaged fields.  Here and there, wrecked war machines, tanks and artillery pieces, dotted the view, while over all lay a covering of light brown dust, fertile soil torn up by weapons of mass destruction.  The four track railway they were running on had evidently once been electrified, broken masts and tangled wires littered the trackside.  Jemima wondered how they were able to travel smoothly over what was obviously a wrecked system, abruptly she found herself looking down into a vast crater, spanning all four tracks and containing the broken wreckage of at least one local train.  Directly beneath her, spanning the crater, was a neatly ballasted strip of Death City track, she felt the slight wrench as the bogie beneath her slammed back onto "real" rails at the far side of the crater.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Soon enough, their train drew near a city, columns of smoke rising above gutted buildings as they rolled through the outskirts.  Looking forwards, Jemima could see force fields flaring blue-white just ahead of the locomotive as it smashed through piles of debris that blocked the tracks.  They were travelling slowly now, another hiss and the brake came off, as they rumbled forwards at a steady twenty miles per hour.  The ruin of a great bridge loomed up, great riveted girders twisted and bent in the sluggish, blood tinged brown waters of a poisoned river.  Again, they crossed on "otherworld" track, lurching slightly as the wheels returned to real contact.  Jemima tried not to think about the emaciated, mutilated corpses she had seen, trapped in the swirling water by the wrecked bridge.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now they entered a tunnel, mercifully free of wreckage, before emerging into the daylight of a ruined main station.  The place had been covered by an overall glass roof, its shattered panes carpeted the cratered platforms in shards of glass.  The support framework had collapsed in several places, leaving twisted girders dangling from what remained.  Still, the way was clear into one of the great through platforms, and into that space they rolled, brakes on, slowing smoothly.  Jemima watched the platform glide past, as they passed the wrecked area and came to the less damaged though roofless main buildings.  She felt the brake bite once more, and the train slowed to walking pace, then slower.  Just before they stopped, she heard the hiss of brakes releasing, and the carriages rolled to a smooth halt, a fine display of skill from the unknown driver.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now we earn our keep", Sammi grinned up at Jemima, "follow me!" She opened the door, and stepped lightly down to the platform.  Jemima followed, exulted at the feeling of standing on an alien world, and at the same time fearful of what she might find in this ruined place. All along the train (and looking back, Jemima realised that it was very long), doors were opening and people were emerging, some sprinted immediately for the stairs that lead (she assumed) to the city beyond, while others began to unload various machines from vans at the back of the train.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do we actually do?", Jemima asked, as she followed Sammi towards a knot of people by the second coach.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We rescue things", the shorter woman responded, "when all is lost, when destruction rides unchallenged, we are sent to ensure that something is saved." Sammi stopped for a moment, and turned to face her lover, "People decide their own fate, for them there are the gods.  Plants, animals, these too have their protectors.  But created things, the beauty by which intelligent life transcends its beginnings - these have no saviour.  So was this", she indicated their train, "and others, called into being." She resumed her march, and Jemima had no time for further questions. As soon as they presented themselves, Sammi was issued with a "locator", a black box with buttons and a screen, and a strange, floating toolkit.  The kit comprised spades and other digging tools, all firmly fixed to a small barge like device, that floated on its own, three feet from the ground they stood on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The man who issued the devices, a tall, slender fellow with short blonde hair, told the pair to search the ruins of the Great Library for the Derithal Books of History, which had been stored there before the war came.  Swiftly, the two women turned and made for the exit stair, following the locator's directions, while the float barge bobbed along behind them, needing no guidance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Half an hour later, standing near the bottom of a rubble formed pit not far from the station, Jemima felt fulfilled for the first time in years.  She was filthy, her knees and bottom brown from sliding and climbing through the ruins, the rest of her outfit covered in brown dust and ground in dirt, sweat poured from her, streaking the dust on her face into mud.  They had found the Books of History, stained and torn but still readable, and had dug them out of the rubble of the library, to be collected by other members of the train's crew.  Now they dug into another pile of dirt, Sammi, below her, even dirtier than she was, seeking the next item the locator said was here.  Soon they found it, a finely wrought bronze statue of a man on a graceful, horse-like creature, and pulled it free of the debris.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On they worked, sleeves rolled up, boots scuffed, rescuing a sculpture here, a book there, once, miraculously, a painting, preserved undamaged beneath a collapsed door.  After a while Sammi called a halt, arm in dusty arm they walked back to the station, dodging barges carrying street lamps and tram rails.  In the station they found others busily dismantling an undamaged part of the canopy, packing the elaborate ironwork in transit cases, ready to be loaded into the freight train that stood in another of the through platforms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi steered them both to the front coach of their train, inside it was open plan, the first class seats arranged two and one either side of the aisle.  Others of the crew were here, while immaculately uniformed stewards served meals to the begrimed workers.  Sammi directed Jemima to sit, for a moment she was nervous of marking the clean upholstery, but then an older woman, grey haired, wearing a black dress, torn and stained with far more than just dry dirt, stood up in front of her, leaving not a single speck on the black moquette of the seat. "Relax", she said in a motherly way, catching Jemima's glance, "you do the good work, you get a few paybacks.  That's how it works."  She gave Jemima a pat on the arm, and stepped outside to resume whatever she had been doing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The two of them sat side by side in the end bay, sharing a plain but filling meal of beef casserole served in deep Yorkshire pudding, washed down with a couple of bottles of Newcastle Brown Ale.  Hunger and thirst satisfied, they resumed their digging.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For three days they toiled in the ruins, returning to the train only to eat and sleep.  Each night they simply stripped off their dirty clothes and fell into bed, having barely enough energy to embrace before sleep took them.  It was hard, heavy work, and yet Jemima felt happy as she never had before, for she was finally doing something worthwhile.  Sammi was in her element, manual work had always been her choice, for all that her mind was keen as any scientist's.  Each morning, a fresh outfit would be ready for them, courtesy of the ever present train stewards.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By mid afternoon on the third day, their mission on Derithos was complete.  Whatever could be rescued, had been, the last of the packing crates were loaded onto a Death City Freight (Steam powered, Jemima noted with interest), and with a cloud of smoke and steam it pulled away, watched by a crowd of people from their train.  As the freight cars rolled past, Jemima felt a rising tide of excitement amongst her fellow crew members, and turned to Sammi for an explanation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is where we let our hair down", Sammi responded, "I'm afraid our tastes are common knowledge on board, we may get clean courtesy of a hosepipe", she grinned up at her lover, "but then again, we may not get clean at all!" Jemima liked the sound of that, but for now all that was happening was a couple of the crew had produced guitars, drums and amplifiers, the latter powered via a cable fed through a coach window.  The musicians took a moment to tune up, then launched into a frenzied rendition of the old Iron Maiden song, The Trooper.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi grabbed Jemima by the arms, and soon the two of them were slam dancing all over the platform, throwing each other about with total abandon.  They were soon joined by the motherly woman, dancing with a short, stocky man Jemima had seen working on the station roof, and a group of three, two men and a woman, all in their thirties, dressed much as Jemima herself was, in jeans and workshirts.  The older woman still wore her ripped black satin dress, dry, but coated in red, yellow and brown dust.  Through the tears in the ankle length skirt Jemima could see the thigh length boots she wore beneath it - quite a costume for a woman pushing fifty.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The music changed to Motorhead's "Ace of Spades", even more frenzied than the first one had been, and Jemima and Sammi went mad with each other, spinning, leaping, gyrating, as the music boomed across the ruined city.  Abruptly, Jemima saw a huge blue splash burst over the older woman's back - someone had thrown a paint balloon.  Soon the man she danced with received a splattering, while her black satin dress absorbed splat after splat of different coloured paint, green on her bottom, yellow across her skirt, orange all over her front, purple on top of her head, flowing thickly through her hair and over the broad straps of the dress.  Jemima imagined what it must be like to be in that dress, feeling the saturated satin cling to every contour, as balloon after balloon burst in technicolour frenzy, drenching the woman and coating her partner as they pulled close together to benefit from maximum splattering.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The three others dancers were getting their share of gunge, too. Jemima saw the Collector, the tall man who had issued their tools, run out of the crowd and mash a thick custard pie onto the girl's denim clad bottom, while another girl threw a bucket of custard over all three of them, splashing the blonde man as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The music changed again, Metallica this time, and more of the watchers got up to dance and be gunged by their fellows.  Skirts, dresses, jumpsuits, with the ubiquitous denim gear, all stained and dusty from working in the ruined city, and now all rapidly being covered in various kinds of glop.  Close behind Sammi, a girl of about seventeen, wearing a knee length dark blue pencil skirt and green satin shirt, writhed in ecstasy as she was engulfed from both sides by two buckets of semolina.  The thick white gunge splattered heavily into her satin shirt, warn wetness flooding through everywhere at once, then the heavy gunge flowed downwards, thick rivulets and heavy dollops flowing and dripping onto the dark blue fabric.  A third bucket took her from behind, coating her skirt and legs, before the two women throwing it walked up to the girl and began to smear handfuls left in the buckets onto the front of her skirt.  Within moments, this new group of three, the two women dressed in jeans and t-shirts, were being bucketed with ketchup, all three clasped together and rubbing the gunge into each others clothes, mixing the red ketchup with the first girl's coating of semolina.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Throughout all this, as everyone else slowly went from dry and dusty to totally drenched, Sammi and Jemima remained conspicuously ungunged. Jemima pulled her lover in close, and whispered into her ear, "Somehow I get the feeling this is not an accident". Sammi smiled up at her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know", she said, as they suddenly found themselves in the centre of a circle of totally drenched people, "you could be right." She laughed then, as the music stopped and the band grabbed a couple of well deserved beers, while the Collector, denim clad and drenched in custard, stepped out of the crowd and bowed low before them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We trust the entertainment is to your satisfaction?" he asked, in a ringmasters voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's brilliant", Sammi, breathless and sweating from the dancing, replied for both of them, "there is just one problem". At that, several of the circle, gunge dripping from their saturated outfits, stepped forwards with buckets of various gunges. "Ah..", Sammi grinned at the Collector, "now this looks like a solution".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Actually", said the Collector, "there is something else to be done first.  Seize them!" The last was directed to a group of three behind him, the girl in the semolina soaked skirt and her two ketchup covered friends.  They produced a rope, stepped forwards, and grabbed Sammi and Jemima by the hands.  In no time at all, the lovers found themselves roped together, and bound to a cast iron column.  They were tied front to front, with their hands tied behind them and Sammi's back to the pillar.  No sooner were they secured in place than the bucket carriers, now numbering over a dozen, stepped enthusiastically towards them. "Are you quite ready for this?", the Collector asked, still with his ringmasters accent. For answer, Jemima bent her head and kissed Sammi's dust and sweat streaked forehead. "Let the gunging commence!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the Collector's word, the first bucketeer stepped up, and Jemima felt cold custard being poured slowly over her tied hands.  She wiggled her fingers in the thick flow, feeling the custard enveloping her dusty skin, cool and refreshing where she had picked up a few scrapes.  The pouring continued, now she felt her wrists, secured by the ropes, dampening, and at the same time became aware that the flow of custard was starting to pour onto the back of her jeans, the dry, dust browned denim starting to soak through as the increasing flow of yellow gloop engulfed her bottom, rivulets of yellow flowing further and thicker over the faded blue fabric, running down her legs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima writhed as the dampness spread, and Sammi writhed with her, anticipation lighting her face.  Abruptly, Jemima bent her legs, dropping down to Sammi's height, and seized her lips in a long, passionate kiss, while custard flowed freely over the back of her shirt, gathering in the waistband of her jeans, little drips trickling down her cotton shorts and onto her bare legs inside the jeans.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They continued the kiss as a second bucketeer came up, and began to pour warm liquid chocolate sauce over their faces, the thick brown gloop dripping heavily onto their foreheads, flowing wetly down over their closed eyes, past noses, around lips joined in joy, to flow over their chins and drip heavily onto their denim clad breasts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi felt the first of it land on her shirt, a moment later, with a stream of sauce flowing towards the waistband of her jeans, she felt the first dampness as the sauce soaked through the denim shirt and cotton t-shirt beneath.  Custard continued to flow over Jemima's rounded bottom, the lines of her jeans pockets just visible beneath the flood of yellow fluid.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now the rest of the bucketeers formed a circle around the pair, and with a count of "One, two, three!" they threw in unison, ketchup, gravy, custard (pink this time), egg yolk, yogurt, all engulfed the lovers in a wave of mess.  Jemima gasped as the weight of the gunge suddenly drenched her jeans, shirt, shorts and t-shirt all over, Sammi writhed in her now totally drenched denims as her clothes soaked through.  Just in case they still had any clean areas, the girl in the semolina soaked skirt poured an extra bucket of melted ice cream down their fronts, the two women pulling apart a little to give her a better angle of attack.  They both squirmed anew as the sticky cream goo flowed over the fronts of their jeans, seeking out the still ungunged patches around their upper thighs and flowing into their front pockets.  Then they pulled together again, squelching against each other while the Collector untied their hands so they could embrace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you", Jemima said with feeling as she threw her sopping arms around her lover and hugged her once again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The gunge party continued, already gunged clothes were filled with fresh substances, long into the evening, while the musicians played on.  Eventually, with the light of alien stars filtering down through what remained of the wrecked station roof, the crew wandered back on board their train, walking on papers spread by the ever present stewards, seeking showers and sleep.  With a rumble and a cloud of smoke the locomotive's mighty deltic engines were started, hurrying the last of the revellers back to their wood panelled luxury.  The last door slammed, the Guard's whistle blew, and with a snarl and a flash of exhaust flame the train began to move.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In their private compartment, Sammi and Jemima stood in the shower, arms around each other, as the warm water flooded through their hair and down, through their gunge soaked outfits.  Again, they writhed in ecstasy, drenched in warm water, with watered down gunge flowing down their jeans.  Slowly, lovingly, they stripped each other in the flowing spray, unbuttoning each others shirts, slipping out of their saturated jeans and shorts.  For a long while, as the train slowly gathered speed beneath them, they hugged each other, still wearing their t-shirts, clasped together with warm, sweet water flowing through their hair and over their bodies, the thin cotton t-shirts, soaking wet and clinging to every line, turning an already sensual experience into a feast of pleasure for both of them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finaly, as the wreckage of Derithos fell away behind them, and the train once again streaked through the eternal void, they stripped off the t-shirts, toweled each other dry, and sought their bed together.</p>
