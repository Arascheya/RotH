<div class="Section1">

<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;Will this never end?&#8221;, Jerris thought as news came off the
wire of yet more eastern governments falling in line with Saul McKenzie&#8217;s
hard-line right-wing agenda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Already
across the eastern continents people were dying, non-conformists to the new
ideas of purity and virtue being herded into ghettoes, or worse, for the crime
of daring to challenge the ancient creeds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And it was spreading.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Youngest and least experienced of the Guardians, Jerris
found it hard to accept her fellow guardians stoicism in the face of the rising
evil beyond the borders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then there
was what she&#8217;d seen in the crystal, when, drawn almost against here will to
cast her gaze eastward, she&#8217;d seen a glimpse of the force that stood behind
McKenzie, huge, dark, indefatigable, ancient beyond imagining, and utterly,
utterly evil.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Jerris slept fitfully that night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Cold, clear, mountain air.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The brilliance of a full moon high above the pristine snow-blanketed
landscape of some long-ago northern realm, a mountain kingdom, well ruled and
prosperous, hard by the flanks of the mighty Northern range.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The viewpoint of an eagle, soaring through
the brilliant night, swooping past mountain crags, beacon stations, and out
over a broad valley where the twinkling lights of nestling farms far below
dotted the silent woods and plains.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Onward, sweeping lower and faster, out across the plain,
mountain wall on the left, rich farming valleys and long rolling hills, all
blanketed in the midwinter snow, below and stretching southwards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Onward, and here was an army, men and women
on horseback, white plumes and black-and-silver standards floating on the cold
night air, charging forward at breakneck speed across the snowplain to meet&#8230;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ahead was only darkness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Veiled, coiled, brooding darkness against which the moonlight failed as
waves against unyielding rock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arround
it lay the slaughtered ruin of the first army these people had sent against it,
the last survivors of the rout huddled together and praying for the relief that
even now swept across the plain to the rescue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Evil stalked this fair land, and for all the glory of their charge, what
hope did any of the rescuers have of even surviving their first attack, much
less relieving their infantry.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Banking hard right and south the soaring viewpoint swept on,
away from that terrible battle and onward across the kingdom, over towns where
blacksmiths worked like demons to produce more and better weapons, where
merchants threw open their stores to feed the defenders, and where people and
priests prayed to every god they knew for help against the darkness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Onward to the great capital, the city of stone built hard
against the tallest and northernmost of the White Mountains, onward and upward,
over guard barracks, over warehouses, over villas and mansions, up, over the
great temple, up to the great citadel, and into a lofty chamber.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Here was Margred, seer of her people, witch, sorceress,
protector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Advisor to the king, speaker
to the realm beyond, for more than 50 years she&#8217;d warded the borders with magic
and kept the people from harm, yet against this invading force of darkness she
was powerless.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">However valiant the warriors, when the coils of the darkness
brushed over them their courage failed and their strength departed, leaving
them weak and defenceless to be butchered by the dark army that marched within
that evil shroud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her own magicks could
not penetrate the veils, for all that she hurled herself and her powers into
the task.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And now she stood by her chamber&#8217;s open window, gazing north
to where even now the king sent another force in desperate peril to try and
fight, all the while the invaders moved on, ever closer to the capital, leaving
naught but butchery and ruin in their wake.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Magred had failed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her powers exhausted, her body close to death, all her arts had failed
utterly against that impenetrable cloak of evil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still her people rallied to the defence of their land, but she
knew despair.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">And yet, was there perhaps still one desperate hope to try?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Beyond the chamber a walkway extended out to the scrying
point, a circular platform built out from the mountain face, fully a thousand
feet above the plain below, a place of peril and high magick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seizing her sacred blade in one hand,
Margred summoned the last of her strength and walked slowly, but steadily, out
of the chamber, along the narrow way, and stepped to the very edge of the
scrying platform. Facing north, toward the advancing evil, with both hands she
grasped the hilt and plunged the blade deep into her own heart, stepping off
the platform into space as she did so.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Down plummeted her dying body, but out and up roared her
soul, gossamer wings riding the air, growing, soaring, and speeding north to
meet the foe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, below her, was the
king&#8217;s third army, lead by his own son and daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There ahead, almost consumed by the evil dark, were the survivors
of the first two forces, huddled and desperate for succour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then Margred was amongst them and her soaring
spirit, given new power past imagining by her own sacrifice, sang and called to
each and every one, blowing away the darkness, replacing stolen strength, and
shielding their minds with warnings of the true nature of what they faced.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;Remember who you are, what you stand for&#8221;, she sang in
their minds, &#8220;he can only be if you believe what he tells you&#8221;, all the while
warding, guarding, and summoning the power of the spirits of the land itself to
lend them the strength to fight on.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The king&#8217;s army charged into the darkness like a thunderclap
of the gods, and this time it was the dark forces who felt the terror of
unstoppable butchery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clean through
their ranks the prince and princess rode, laying waste to all around them in a
frenzy of flashing steel and slaughter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Behind came their army, reinforced by the survivors who no longer
huddled but instead roared back to the attack, wielding all and any weapons
they could muster and utterly routing their erstwhile attackers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In minutes it was over, the physical lord of the dark forces
slain, his army routed, and the great evil power they had summoned fled with
unimaginable speed to whatever dark lair it had come from, banished, driven out
by Magred&#8217;s final strike.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Jerris jerked awake, thrown physically out of bed by the
force of the dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or was it a
dream?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There in the chamber air in
front of her floated Magred&#8217;s face, her expression an unreadable mix of joy and
sorrow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said but one sentence, and
then she was gone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;Shall he rule, again?&#8221;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>
