<p class="pagecaption">Sammi and Jemima - Chapter 1</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For The Love Of A Messy Woman.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mrs Henderson's ugly face stalked towards Jemima, protruding lips quivering below her scowl as she prepared to  deliver another  of her soul destroying tirades of abuse.  This time, however, Jemima was ready  for her,  gone was  the suicidal  depression that  had gripped her since Sammi was taken by the drug gangs, she felt  as high as  if she  was on  drugs herself,  mentally re-reading  the crumpled  note  in  her  jacket  pocket,  "Come  to our  station, platform one, tonight, eight-fifteen - Love Sam".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As  the  aging  matron of  discontent strode  closer, her  double breasted maroon jacket flapping open above her white silk  blouse and maroon skirt, Jemima remembered what her lover had said, just hours before they were torn apart by the gangs, "If  I go  first, I'll make Death Herself send a train for you".  That was  typical of Sammi, she really thought she could take on  heaven and  earth single handed,  and by  the letter  in Jemima's  pocket that  was exactly what she had done!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mrs Henderson had now reached Jemima's desk, without pausing  for breath she began  to lay  in to  Jemima about  her work,  working herself  into  a  frenzy  about  missed full stops  and  niggling spelling errors.  Normally Jemima would have  cowered back  under this onslaught, but this time she simply  smiled up  at the  old dragon, and casually reached for the cream tart she had bought at tea break.  She honestly meant to eat it, she loved cream  tarts, but this time she knew a better use for it.  Without  so much  as blinking, still smiling up at the  venomous old  crow above  her, she raised  her  arm  and  splattered  the big  tart  into  Mrs Henderson's face, following it up with a  cup of  cold coffee  to the old harridan's silk blouse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">That certainly shut her up, everyone else in the office stared as the cream and jam filling  began to  drip in  heavy dollops  down their  boss's  expensive  suit,  the  brown  damp  stain  rapidly spreading  from  blouse  to skirt  as Jemima  added several  more cupfuls of cold coffee from the surrounding desks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the fourth cupful something snapped in  Mrs Henderson's  mind, in a blind frenzy she groped for Jemima, while  a hideous  shriek burst from her lips.   Jemima  danced out  of the  way while  the thoroughly  gunged  woman  tried  to  chase  her,  knocking  over computers and falling over chairs.  Eventually, more by luck than judgment, Mrs Henderson trapped Jemima in the corner by the water cooler,  without  a  second thought  the young  woman lifted  the nearly  full  plastic tank, water sloshing over  her long  blue skirt, and threw it at the still screaming  boss.   The tank  hit her full  in  the  chest, and  burst open,  cold water  flooding through  Mrs Henderson's  clothes, soaking  jacket, blouse,  bra, skirt and panties in  one deluge  of wetness.   She  fell to  the floor in the middle of a spreading puddle, dollops  of wet  cream raining onto the carpeted floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Without  so  much as  a backwards  glance, Jemima  strode to  the doors, enjoying the sensation of her wet  skirt flapping  against her legs, and was gone. Half an hour later, Jemima was happy as a lark, striding casually along  a boggy  trail in  the blazing  heat of  a midsummer  day, splashing through puddles  and thin  patches of  mud, her  skirt, still damp from  the office,  snagging on  thorns and  splattered with  the  mud she  was splashing  up.   The rest  of her  office outfit, white silk panties, lace bra, cream silk blouse and  blue single breasted jacket, were still clean and dry, although  she'd had to fight off the temptation to fill her panties with soft ice cream  as  she left  the office  block.   She knew  she would  be bathing in mud shortly however, so she had  wrapped Sammi's  note in cling film, and put it in a small inside pocket of her jacket, she could live without filling that one!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The lower part of her calf length skirt sported several snags and small tears from the vegetation, but she was careful  not to  let it rip badly,  like Sammi  she preferred  to do  her mud  bathing fully  clad,  so  she  could enjoy  the sensations  of her  slimy clothing to the full.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The mud she splashed through was getting wetter  and deeper,  now her feet were sinking ankle deep, and  the surface  ahead of  her shuddered  slightly  with  every  step,  revealing  it's depth. Abruptly  she  reached  the  clearing,  their  clearing  as   she remembered it, where she and Sammi  had shared  so many  intimate muddy moments.  She stopped at the edge, as soon as she was still she began sinking slowly, just like she remembered.  Boldly,  she strode a couple of yards out, stopping when she nearly fell over. Then she stood still, as the hem of her skirt  settled onto  the surface of the mud.  She knew it  wasn't quicksand,  there was  a firm base about four feet down, but for now she was sinking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The mud rose  to her  knees, she  wiggled her  legs, feeling  the thick  black  muck slide  over her  skin, rising  up towards  her thighs.  When it was halfway to her panties, she leaned back  and sat down, pressing her skirt into the swamp, wiggling her hips in the mud as the wetness soaked through the polyester and  drenched the back of her panties.  Plunging her manicured  hands into  the muck, she lifted two handfuls and splattered them into her lap.   Rapidly she repeated the procedure, as she sank deeper, and  then she spread the  muck over  the front  of the  skirt, pressing  it against the tops of her legs and massaging her abdomen as the mud she was sitting in greedily sucked her down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now her legs and  lower body  were almost  submerged, her  jacket resting  on  the oozing  muck, carefully  she began  to fill  her pockets.  First she did the  outer ones,  as they  would soon  be submerged  anyway,  then,  as  the  rising tide  of black  slowly enveloped the waistline of her skirt and the creamy  silk of  her blouse, she filled her inside pockets, black drips streaking  the jacket lining where she spilled some. By the  time her  pockets were all full, except the one with the note, the  rising mud  had reached her bosom, she could feel the wetness soaking through her bra and tingling against the lower surface  of her  breasts.   As she remembered, at this point she stopped sinking, and for a  few moments  she  just  sat  there,  watching  the  dark damp  stains spreading from her muck filled pockets and playfully smearing mud on her jacket, where it met the swamp.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It  felt  wonderful  to  just  sit  there,  legs  and lower  body submerged in the mud, deliberately trashing the  outfit that  had come to symbolise her misery  these last  few months.  Soon  she would be free forever, with that thought in mind she scooped up a double handful of muck, and poured it  down the  neckline of  her blouse, wriggling with excitement as the cold thick fluid  poured into her cleavage.  Again and yet  again she  repeated the  move, filling the front of her blouse with the rich dark mud, after the third handful she smeared the thick coating on  her hands  across her chest, carefully sliming the silk to the collar.  Just  about the only clean areas of clothing left were her  upper sleeves,  a couple of handfuls  applied both  inside and  outside her  jacket soon saw to those, she kept pushing mud into  the jacket  sleeves at the shoulders until the run off dripped from her wrists,  then she lay back, covering her back and shoulders,  and pressing  her curly brunette locks into the muck.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While she lay there, looking up at the sky, she carefully  worked the mud into her hair, "shampooing" herself with  it, working  it deep into the roots, and  leaving nothing  but her  face clear.   Jemima had  never really  liked having  her face  gunged, it  was always  Sammi  who went  diving head  first into  every bog  they found, never the less she rubbed the mud over her skin now, first her throat, then her chin, her high boned cheeks, one at a  time, a good smear across her  forehead, and  finally the  tip of  her nose.  Then she dug her arms deep in the mud,  wiggled her  hips, rocked her head, and  relaxed, revelling  in the  feeling of  mud soaked polyester, silk and lace, as  the movements  of her  body pressed the mud inside her skirt up against her panties, and the last clean spot of cloth was swallowed by the muck.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For  a  long  while  Jemima lay  there, luxuriating  in the  cool wetness, before she finally started to move.  The mud was greedy, as she raised her head it gripped her  hair, she  could feel  the constant tugging as her head came free and her feet sank  towards the bottom.  The rich muck flowed reluctantly around her body  as she  worked  herself  into  first  a  sitting,  then  a  standing position, she loved the feeling of  it dragging  at her  drenched jacket as she stood up, once her feet had found  the firm  bottom beneath.  It was impossible to walk forwards, instead she plunged her arms into the  liquid goo  and began  "swimming" towards  the edge, revelling in the feeling of the muck sliding over her slimy clothing.  Eventually she reached the shallower  area, and  stood up. Slowly,  one small  step at  a time,  she struggled  forwards through  the  waist  deep  muck,  gradually she  rose, like  some ancient goddess of the mud, a thick layer of black slime  coating her as she worked her way to the edge.  Eventually, she was free, she stood at the far side of the mudpool, thick dollops of  black muck dripping from the ragged hem of her skirt, which clung wetly to her mud caked legs.  Kneeling down at the edge, she scooped up a  double  handful  of  muck, and  bowing her  head slightly  she crowned herself with it, a  final extra  helping of  goo to  flow through her hair, over her shoulders and down her clothes.   Then she turned, and  leaving a  trail of  muck behind  her, made  for home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Half an hours walk  saw her  back in  her flat,  she'd have  been quicker but various well meaning folk had kept  stopping her  and offering to take her to the police station / hospital / loony bin / circus(??) / etc.  One guy, wearing a  discreet "splat"  badge, had even offered to take her home!  Another time she'd have  been tempted, he was good looking, about 6', slim, wearing faded black denim, his long dark hair had that  special sheen  she knew  came only from a "gunge shampoo" followed  by a  really deep  cleaning session, but she knew her destiny lay with  Sammi, wherever  that might lead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once she finally reached her sanctuary, she  headed straight  for the shower, and spent  a lovely  half hour  washing the  clinging muck from her  hair and  clothes, before  gradually stripping  to bare skin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outside, the sun still blazed relentlessly  down, quickly  Jemima towelled herself off, before stepping briskly to the bedroom  and fetching her other set of office wear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Again, she started  with silk  panties, black  this time,  paired with a black lace  bra, over  which she  pulled on  a green  silk shirt,  black  ski pants,  black ankle  boots and  a short  black jacket.  This was the outfit Sammi had preferred, needless to say Mrs Henderson disproved,  but then  that cow  even disliked  long skirts, she'd have forced all the secretaries into being  company whores given half a chance!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now Jemima opened the door  that had  been locked  since the  day Sammi  disappeared,  the  flat's  second  bedroom,  their   gunge chamber.  Within, neatly stacked, stood ten catering size cans of baked  beans, left  over from  the birthday  surprise Jemima  had prepared for her lover just before she was taken.  There was also an empty bathtub, over which lay a broad plank seat,  and in  the far corner stood their "gunging chair", where Jemima used to  let Sammi strap her in and then splatter her with anything that  took her fancy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Quickly, Jemima opened all the bean cans, and poured nine of them into the bathtub.  The tenth she poured onto the seat, there  was a  depression  for  her bum,  and a  slight ridge  around it,  to contain the beans like a wide, deep plate.   The  big can  filled the seat, and some overflowed to drip off the plank into the  ten inch  deep  bath below.   Now  she was  ready, for  a moment  she contemplated  the  bath,  trying  to  decide  what  to do  first, abruptly she stepped into the beans, her boots sinking altogether while the sticky sauce soaked into the bottoms of her ski  pants, and sat down on the plank.  She put her hands on her hips as  her ski  pants  touched the  surface, wiggling  her body  as her  bum pressed down, enjoying the  lovely sensation  of beans  squashing beneath  her  sauce  soaked,  nylon  and  silk  clad bottom.  The pressure of her sitting down sent a wave of beans  and sauce  out of the seat, she could feel the sticky wetness under her  thighs, while her wiggling was squashing the beans that  had flowed  into her boots, while allowing more to enter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bending forwards, she  pulled off  her right  boot, plunging  the bare foot back into the beans she filled the boot with them, and then poured beans from the boot into her jacket pockets.  One  by one the pockets filled with beans and sauce, while she  squelched from side to side in her soggy seat.  Once all  the pockets  were overflowing, sticky sauce running  down both  inside and  outside her jacket, she filled the boot again, and then  forced her  foot back into it, squashed beans and sauce  squirting up  the leg  of her ski pants.  Next, she removed the other boot, filled it,  and used  it  to top  up her  seat, raising  herself slightly  before squelching down again, sending another wave of goo down the backs of her legs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now she took off her somewhat  heavy jacket,  and carefully  laid it, inside down, on the surface of the beans.  Standing up,  with one bean filled boot still in her hand, she walked on the jacket, forcing it down into the  bath, saturating  it with  sauce.   For several minutes she trampled it into the goo, while at the  same time pouring the bootfull of beans down inside the front of  her ski pants,  over her  silk panties.   Slowly  the soggy  wetness slipped down her legs, she added several more  bootfuls down  her front before  squishing her  foot back  into the  boot, then  she swiftly pulled the jacket  out of  the bath and put  it on,  the thick heavy sogginess soaking her thin silk shirt in moments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a long moment she just stood there, rocking  slowly back  and forth, feeling the thick sauce dripping down  her clothes,  then, slowly, she knelt down in the beans, sat back,  pressing her  bum into the deep heavy mush, straightening her legs and lying back.  As  she sank  into the  bath of  beans she  grabbed handfuls  and pressed them against her ski pants, rubbing mashed beans over the elasticated fabric, and squashing the ones already inside against her skin and panties.   Finally, she  pressed her  head back  and down, using her  hands to  press her  hair down  into the  sauce, before repeating her earlier "shampooing", working the sauce  and mashed beans deep into her hair, drenching it totally.  Then  she lay still, utterly relaxed, as all  the tension  and pressure  of the last three months of misery slowly faded away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">How long she lay  in her  bath of  beans Jemima  could not  later tell, all thought of time and  reality fled  as she  contemplated what was to come.  She realised that whatever happened at  Friary Street railway station that night, her life would never return to it's old course.  Sammi had been gone these  three months,  taken by the  ruthless drug  gangs as  a warning  to any  who might  to follow her lead.  The police had found  no body,  but then  there were places in the ship canal so deep and dark that no dredger or diver ever penetrated their secrets, a body,  wrapped in  chains, might lie there for decades undiscovered...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima  remembered  again  her  lover's  words  "I'll make  Death Herself send a train for you".   Sammi  had been  train mad,  she knew everything there was to know about railways, at first Jemima couldn't understand her interest, but later, once Sammi had taken her on a few special trips, and  she'd ridden  in the  preserved coaches and heard the big diesels roar, she began to understand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now, as  the beans  washed sluggishly  around her,  she tried  to remember all that she had picked  up in  the year  they had  been together, everything from engine numbers to the time they'd spent half  an  hour,  clasped  together,  wearing  jumpsuits,  pouring cooking oil over  each other  in a little disused  cabin on  the bridge that  carried the  tracks out  of Central  Station.   What would happen at Friary Street at eight fifteen?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Eventually, she knew it was time to  prepare to  leave.   Soggily she  climbed  out  of  the bean bath, streams  of sauce  flowing thickly down her silk  shirt and  ski pants,  her jacket raining sauce onto her legs as she stood.  Quickly she crossed the rubber coated  floor,  her  feet squelching  and squishing  in her  bean filled, glistening leather boots, and entered the shower cabinet beside the door.  Slowly she turned the water  on, relishing  the feelings as the thick bean sauce coating her hair gave way to the cool water, writhing and caressing  herself as  the sauce  washed down her jacket, clear water following in  its place.   Once  the worst of the gunge had washed out of the jacket, she took it  off and hung it in the  "wash chamber",  a joint  invention they had rigged up using old dishwasher parts, and turned it on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now she stood under the shower again, clean  cool water  flooding over her silk shirt and ski pants, she pulled  her waistband  out and directed a  strong stream  of water  down the inside of  the trousers, washing the  mashed bean  residue off  her panties  and legs and sending the remains  down into  her boots.   She  pulled them off, and  placed them  in the  holders in  the wash  chamber before stripping off the rest of her clothes beneath the powerful shower spray.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Soon enough she was clean again, briskly she towelled herself dry in front of the big mirror, checking her  body over  objectively for the first time in months.  Would Sammi still want  her? The thought was ridiculous, of course her lover wanted her, otherwise she wouldn't have gone to all the bother of  setting tonight  up, nevertheless, after three months of loneliness Jemima had to work hard to overcome her own paranoia. At least she needn't fear for her appearance, her firm, lithe body,  with it's  long legs  and small  but firm  breasts looked as good  as ever  (like a  young goddess, Sammi had once said!), now that  she was  clean and  dry she strode back to the bedroom, and started to look out something to wear for the reunion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Half an hour later, the heat of the day starting to dissipate  as the sun sailed westwards, Jemima was ready to leave.  She dressed casually,  hooded  blue and  white hooped  sweatshirt over  black t-shirt, blue jeans, plain leather belt and flat soled boots, with her usual silk and lace black underwear. Both t-shirt and  sweatshirt were tucked into her jeans. In a  large holdall  were packed  her other four  outfits,  along  with  the few  personal things  she treasured, and the photo CD that held Sammi's many train photos.   The rest, books, magazines, videos, she left.   Somehow she  knew she wouldn't be needing them again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Quietly she left the flat, locking the door behind her, half  way to the station she met a homeless girl selling "The Big Issue" in the street outside a pub, without a second thought she tossed the stranger  the  keys to  the flat,  rattled off  the address,  and walked on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It  was  five  past  eight when  Jemima reached  the stone  built Victorian railway station, swiftly she climbed  the broad  flight of stone stairs beneath their vaulted ceiling, and emerged in the booking hall.  There were no staff on duty at this time of  night (just as well considering the messy encounter she  and Sammi  had shared one night on platform three after the last passenger train had gone!), so she just  walked out  onto the  platform, chose  a seat, and sat down to wait. At eight ten, a westbound "Sprinter" unit (a  "plastic" as  Sammi had  called  them) arrived  at platform two, a  minute later  it departed, the sound of it's  wheels gradually  diminishing as  it glided down towards the  coast.   The station  clock now  showed thirteen  minutes  past  eight,  clutching Sammi's  note in  one nervous  hand,  Jemima  strained to  catch the  faintest hint  of something coming.   Eight  fourteen, and  still nothing,  Jemima began to panic, surely this wasn't some kind of sick joke?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For what seemed like forever, but was in fact just a few seconds, Jemima began to  think the worst, then,  like a  whisper on  the wind, from far down the valley she caught the sound  of a diesel locomotive, a faint throbbing vibration in the air.   Leaping  to her feet, giddy with anticipation, she peered  westwards, as  the distant sound drew nearer and grew louder.   Now  it drew  close, and she no longer feared for a trick  - no  earthly engine  could have  produced  the roaring   thunder  that   echoed  from   the surrounding hills, booming and throbbing in her  ears. Finally, she could see  it, a  flickering headlight  approaching from  the west.  Now  came the squeal of  brakes, and  the black  liveried train growled its way into the station, sparks  flying from cast iron brake blocks.  As the  high nosed  locomotive throbbed  past she caught a number, 55055, and a name, "Shergar".  The  gleaming engine reached the end of the platform, and ground to a halt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A door opened in the second  coach, despite  her earlier  resolve Jemima quaked in the presence of the Power that took human  form, and stepped from the train, dark robed,  her scythe unmistakable under the station lamps.  Lady Death beckoned,  Jemima picked  up her holdall and gingerly  stepped forwards.   She  kept her  eyes fixed on the open carriage door as she crossed the wide platform, fearing to look too closely at Death Incarnate.  A moments  walk, and she stood beside the train, eyes  cast down,  her holdall  on the flagstones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She felt a touch on her skin, gently the Lady held Jemima's chin, and raised her head to gaze into her eyes. "Is  this",  death  indicated  the  train,  "really your  heart's desire?"  The voice was soft yet  resonant, full  of both  wisdom and compassion. Jemima's answer was a simple "Yes, Lady." "Then so shall it be." A lad appeared, and took her holdall aboard, she went to  follow, but the Lady stopped her. "Wait, you must be prepared for your lover". Suddenly, the Lady's hand held a large can of  condensed milk,  a quick motion of the scythe and  the can  top disappeared,  Jemima found herself turned round, she felt the Lady's hand at the  back of her neck, and then cold thick fluid was  being poured  inside her sweatshirt, both inside and outside her t-shirt.  She  gasped as Lady Death continued to pour, the entire contents  of the  can flowing over her neck  and down her back.   She  could feel  the thick liquid collecting at her waist, spreading around the inside of the sweatshirt where it was tucked into her  jeans and  pulled tight by the belt.  When all  the milk was in  her clothes,  the Lady gave her a gentle  push towards  the train  door, "Coach  D, back that way", she said, "and don't drip on the  floor till  you meet her".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima  boarded  the train,  the Lady  followed, invisible  hands swung the door shut behind her.  Somewhere further back a whistle blew, the unseen driver gave a long blast on his horn, and with a roar  and  a  flash  of  red  flame  from the  exhaust ports  the monstrous locomotive began to move. Jemima hurried down the corridor,  feeling the  wetness start  to soak into her jeans, glad she'd tucked them into her boots.   The back of her t-shirt was  soaked, clinging  to her  skin, now she could feel a thin stream of thick  wetness working  its way down her bottom  cleavage, the  silk of her panties  clinging to  the spreading damp.   Her  walking had  spread the  trapped milk  all around her waist, she could  feel it  seeping down  her front  as well, with  every step  her panties clung a  little more,  while there was plenty still sloshing around inside the sweatshirt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stepped from Coach B to Coach C,  another corridor  stretched before her, she hurried a little more as drips  began to  trickle down her legs, dampening the jeans from the inside as she moved.  She  could  see  drops starting  to form  on the  outside of  the saturated sweatshirt, now she was almost running  as she  reached the end of the coach and rushed through the gangway into Coach D. A drip fell from her waist to her jeans leg as  she turned  into the corridor, as she reached the first  compartment door  Sammi's hands grabbed her and pulled her into the  little room,  clasping Jemima tightly and squeezing a flood of condensed milk out of the soggy  sweatshirt  and down  her jeans.   Jemima  threw her  arms around Sammi, and held her like she'd never let go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a long moment  the lovers  held each  other, saying  nothing, just  holding  each  other,  as  the condensed  milk flowed  down Jemima's  jeans and  soaked into  the front  of Sammi's  scarlet, elastic waisted,  polycotton boilersuit,  darkening the  material where they touched.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi was shorter than Jemima, a touch over five feet, slim, fair and petite.  Her long blonde hair flowed straight down her  back, her  dancer's  figure  showed  off to  good effect  by the  tight waisted boilersuit she wore.  On her feet were  black boots,  the leg bottoms of her boilersuit tucked into them,  while her  fine, aristocratic features showed clear in her  bare face,  unmolested by makeup or fakery.  Sammi  had always  been the  wilder of  the pair,  a  true  renegade, endlessly  willing  to  gunge  herself anytime,  anywhere.  She  always  preferred  to  wear overalls, boilersuits or dungarees, "just in case the messy mood takes me!" she had joked.  Her idea of underwear  was a  leotard and  cotton cycling  shorts,  not  for  Sammi  the  silk and  lace her  lover affected.  To most folk, Sammi had seemed a dangerous weirdo, one step behind the hippies and one step ahead of the asylum, but  to those few who knew her, she was friendship and love  personified. Her word was sacred oath, once her trust was given,  it could  be relied upon to the end, others might  fail her,  but never  would she fail them.  To Jemima, she was life and soul, without  Sammi, noting else mattered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi's  compartment  was  larger  than  any   Jemima  had   seen elsewhere, six feet wide as usual, but eighteen feet long, it had three windows, various seats, a bath, shower and an open door  in the end wall, beyond which Jemima could see a double bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I  wasn't  sure  you'd  come",  Sammi's  soft  but  husky  voice whispered in Jemima's ear. "For you, anything."  Jemima's reply said all that was needed, as she hugged Sammi all the  more tightly, both women  lost in  the passion of their embrace, while the Lady's condensed milk  flowed freely down their legs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After a while, rocking and swaying as the train gathered speed on it's eternal journey, Sammi  and Jemima  loosened their  embrace, and gazed into each other's eyes. "You want to get messy?", Sammi asked, a  mischievous twinkle  in her eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For an answer, Jemima reached behind her lover to a  rack on  the wall, which just happened to contain a dozen large eggs.  With  a grin, she grabbed  one, rested  it on  the crown  of her  lover's head, and pressed down hard.  Splat, the egg burst, and her  hand squelched down onto Sammi's clean blonde locks, egg white flowing down the back of her head.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ohh..", Sammi writhed in Jemima's arms, "give me the lot!" Jemima was happy to  oblige, bursting egg after  egg on  Sammi's head, while the clear and yellow sticky mess  flowed through  her hair and onto her boilersuit.  After  the seventh  egg, raw  yolk began  to  drip  down Sammi's  face, flowing  over her  forehead, running either side of her nose, over her lips and down her chin, before dripping onto the front  of the  boilersuit, leaving  long yellow stains down the scarlet material.   Once  all twelve  eggs were on Sammi, Jemima noticed four large  tubs of  yogurt on the shelf, with glee she grabbed them, three went onto Sammi's  head, following the eggs down her hair and face, the fourth she  handed to  Sammi,  who  quickly  emptied it  into the  hood of Jemima's sweatshirt.  They both wanted to let more of the yogurt flow from Sammi's  head  onto her  boilersuit front  before they  embraced again, so Sammi added a bag of flour and a large  can of  treacle to the mess in Jemima's hood.  By  now a  wave of  white goo  was flowing over Sammi's front, again the lovers clasped each  other, Sammi pulling Jemima's hood, squelch! onto her head, while Jemima shampooed the yogurt and egg mixture into  Sammi's hair,  working the goo carefully into each strand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The  contents  of  the hood  had drenched  Jemima's own  brunette locks,  while  she  could  feel the treacle  and yogurt  mixture flowing down her already soaked back to join  the condensed  milk at  her  waist.    Meanwhile  the  front  of  her sweatshirt  was saturated with the yogurt from Sammi's front.  Jemima could  feel Sammi's hands squishing the thick mixture through her sweatshirt, abruptly Sammi grabbed the back of her  belt and  pulled it  out, allowing the  mess trapped  in the  sweatshirt to  flow over  her panties and into the bum of her  jeans, Jemima writhed as  Sammi caressed her bottom, sending the  oozing mess  flowing down  both legs, to join the trickle of condensed milk in her boots.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shall we bathe?", again that mischievous  twinkle, Sammi's  eyes alight with joy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now Jemima saw that the  bathtub was  half full  of lemon  yellow custard,  stepping  over  to  it, she  climbed  in, booted  feet disappearing  into  the  yellow goo  before she  leaned back  and lowered herself in.  Her firm, denim clad buttocks   touched  the surface of the custard,  and abruptly  the cold  dampness of  the condensed milk and treacle was replaced  by warm  wetness as  she sank down into the  bath, custard  welling up  between her  legs, flowing all around her jeans, coating the back of her sweatshirt. Now her trunk was disappearing, thick yellow fluid flowing  over the crisp denim, caressing her thighs and flowing steadily up the front of her jeans as she settled  lower.   Her buttocks  reached the bottom of the bath as  the custard  swallowed her  waistline, slowly she lowered her legs into the goo,  revelling in sensation as the dark blue denim of her jeans was swallowed up by the  warm yellow liquid. She lay back, as her  jeans submerged completely, the  yellow  custard  contrasting with  the white  yogurt on  her sweatshirt.  Her arms were still mostly clean, that soon  changed as she plunged them into the bath, bending her knees, sliding her body into the tub, as a wave of custard engulfed her to the neck. Sammi stood watching as Jemima's custard soaked  legs rose  from the bath, rocking and writhing to the still accelerating train's motion as yogurt continued to drip down her boilersuit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once she was well covered, Jemima straightened her legs and  slid back to a sitting position, leaning back against the  end of  the tub while her legs stretched out in the custard, the yellow fluid lapping at her chest.  There was a cup beside  the bath,  swiftly Jemima poured six cupfuls of custard down inside her  sweatshirt, ensuring  both  t-shirt  and  bra  were coated, and filling  her cleavage.  Then she raised one yellow slimed  hand, and  beckoned Sammi to join her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The  smaller  woman  stepped  into  the  bath,  her feet  between Jemima's knees, and started to sit down.   Her  bottom was  still mostly  clean  as  it  descended  towards the  custard, then  she reached the surface, and the thick yellow gloop rapidly  engulfed the scarlet  polycotton as  Sammi squelched  down on  top of  her lover, and the displaced  custard rose  higher in  the bathtub.   Like Jemima, she lay back and  straightened her  legs, the  thick yellow goo greedily engulfing the clean red material. Her already coated hair brushed Jemima's face as she settled into their  long remembered loving position, Sammi cradled in  Jemima's arms,  her head on Jemima's shoulder as  the taller  woman used  the cup  to pour custard over Sammi's top half, taking care to pour cup after cup inside the boilersuit, where it flowed freely over the  green leotard and black cotton shorts she wore beneath.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Then, drenched head to foot in slimy  mess, they  lay relaxed  in their embrace, warm custard flowing sluggishly  through and  over their clothes in time to the motion of the train.  Far beyond the mortal world, they sped through the eternal void, east of  Heaven and west  of Hell,  their love for each  other enveloping  their souls  as  the  custard  enveloped  their  bodies.   Gently  they caressed  each  other,  Jemima's  hands  soft and  gentle as  she massaged Sammi's lithe figure, Sammi, playful, reaching down  and tickling her  lover through  the custard.   With  a grin,  Jemima nibbled at Sammi's ear, Sammi turned her flexible neck, and their lips met, a lingering kiss with a hint of more to come.   Onwards sped the train, the big diesel roaring through  eternal night  on its way, somewhere....</p>
