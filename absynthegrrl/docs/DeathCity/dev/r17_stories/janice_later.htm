<p class="pagecaption">Janice - A Later Section</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Before the great gilded gates of Narnoth, war bared its teeth to the morning.  Sunlight glittered from sword blades and spear points, crossbow quarrels and axe heads, as the forces of Princess Eriahan and the Grand Duke Servastio fought with murderous savagery for control of the hills before the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Men, women and horses screamed as they were cut down and hacked apart by crimson stained steel.  The once hard ground was soggy with blood and gore, the battlefield littered by the bodies of the slain.  The wounded lay where they fell, coughing pink froth and screaming as they were trampled beneath iron shod feet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Duke had repeatedly tried to ensnare the rebel princess, yet each time her smaller force had out fought and out run his army.  Finally, he had pursued her to Narnoth, with the blessings of the Emperor and the power of the court mages at his call, if he could win to the gates she would be his.  For two weeks he had tried to storm the city, and for two weeks the rebel princess had held him from the gates.  Their armies had fought each other to a standstill, yet still the carnage continued, each side making hopeless attacks and counter strikes day after day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On a low hill some way from the battlefield, a dark figure on a black horse raised a curious brass tube to her eyes. Janice the Black watched the battle through her scrying glass with grim amusement. "Fools", she thought, "wasting their precious lives in such futile cause". A brief smile flashed across her aristocratic features at the thought.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was not tall, standing a little over five feet, yet her supple, slender sculpted body proportions were just right, while her head could have been crafted by the gods themselves.  High, fine cheekbones, large green eyes and a mass of flowing red hair had given her a beauty rarely seen in her eastern homeland.  Now it was hidden though, the hair bound beneath her black hood, while the soft flesh of her face bore a geometric grid of black scars, carved there by a poisoned dagger many years before.  Golgathena she was called, Slayer of Angels.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Swinging the tube to the right brought the Duke's command post into view, a neat encampment of shield guarded tents behind an earthen rampart, moving back across the struggling fighters Janice focused on the city walls.  The princess stood beside one of the gate towers, a striking sight in her burnished armour and scarlet cape, directing the battle from above.  There was a flicker of motion as a dark caped figure hastened into the tower, the princess inclined her gleaming helm as she studied the flow of the battle below, then smoothly issued several orders.  Janice had to admire her style, even in the silent world of the scrying tube the princess's authority shone clear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Turning her horse Janice rode away westwards, bypassing the battle and the city she travelled northwest, along the foothills of the mountain range against whose southern flank the city was built.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Three nights later, still the embattled forces made no progress, grimly they lay in their camps awaiting another day of butchery.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Few folk were abroad in the embattled city in the cold watches of the night, none heard the almost silent footsteps as the darkly clad figure emerged from a forgotten tunnel under the great fountain in Queens Court and slipped into hiding in the shadowy doorways of the Imperial offices. The assassin stiffened as a guard passed unawares two feet from her hiding place, as soon as he was gone she climbed swiftly to the first floor balconies and vanished inside the darkened building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the end of the first floor corridor a skilfully hidden door in the panelling opened into a narrow spiral stair concealed in the thickness of the wall.  Sure-footedly the woman in black descended the stair and strode along the dusty underground passage below.  A change in the feel of the air told her she had reached the great cavern beneath the citadel, with uncanny accuracy she found the long forgotten stairway to the dungeon, and began to climb.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The guard in the lowest dungeon passage glanced nervously at the ancient fissure at the far end of the rock hewn corridor for the fifth time, again he fancied he heard the sound of soft footsteps coming from the crack.  Twice he had examined the rock with a guttering torch, and twice assured himself that nothing larger than a small snake could penetrate its depths, yet, again his eyes were drawn unwilling to look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The guard gave a grunt of surprise as the sleeping dart sank into his neck, his head whipped around in time to see a woman in black standing before the fissure, then his eyes darkened as consciousness fled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Five levels above the upper dungeon a door opened just enough to admit a black figure, then softly closed.  Inside, on a great four poster bed, beneath satin sheets and duck-down quilts, lay the princess Eriahan and her lover Jenira.  A small phial of green liquid held under her nose was enough to ensure that the princess would sleep till morning, now the dark assassin stepped back to savour her task.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The tall slender lady Jenira was many things to the princess, however it was her role as military adviser that brought Janice the Black to their bedchamber in the deep watches of the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Moving swiftly yet silently, the dark woman moved about the chamber, chanting softly beneath her breath as she touched door, walls, window, weapons.  Now she slowed, and with measured paces, strode to the bed. One touch, and Jenira was awake, a brief moment of confusion, swiftly banished, as the tactician's mind saw and understood the fate awaiting her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jenira was no fool, many times she had outwitted enemies wilier and greater than she, yet now she knew disappear.  Though no sorcerer, she recognised the faint red glow that rimmed the door, walls and window as a wall of power, through which neither sound nor force could pass. Armies could fight within that chamber and the castle guard would know naught, while no army yet spawned could break their way in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would not it be simpler to slay us as we slept?"  Jenira faced the nemesis, even as she reached for her hidden dagger, "for surely that is the assassin's way?".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Janice made no answer, instead she drew a small wooden box from within the folds of her cloak, and proceeded to set up a chessboard. Cautiously, Jenira slipped her lithe form from the bed and drew a robe about her.  All her soul cried out in terror at the black assassin's presence, yet there was a dark fascination about her measured actions that the taller woman found irresistible.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At length, Janice threw back her hood, and spoke.  "You are regarded as a master of strategy.  Six times you have confounded those who would destroy your mistress, each time with inferior forces and a disadvantaged position.  Now, however, it seems that you are finally brought to bay, for while you can keep the duke from this citadel, you can neither advance nor retreat, and with every day that passes more of your mistress's folk die or desert." Her voice was demure, aristocratic with that whiff of refinement that marked true nobility from the battle rich, yet it reeked of power and knowledge far beyond the ken of ordinary mortals.  Gently, she continued, "I am, as you said, an assassin.  I kill for pleasure and profit, I kill without mercy, and I never fail.  Some would say I have no regard for life, yet this is not so.  Can you,  Jenira of Lucia, child of the beggar woman Irma d'Fay, understand this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You kill cleanly, and no matter how crowded the situation, you kill only your target, never any others.  You cut like a surgeon,  where others would bludgeon as an orc among children."  Jenira answered the assassin's riddle even as her mind recovered from the shock of hearing her true origin from the lips of a stranger.  Something of her shock must have shown on her face, for smoothly Janice continued, "Do not fear for your secrets, all those who knew that tale are dead, by my hand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something about the dark woman's manner of speech reassured Jenira, no matter what else might befall, somehow she sensed that Golgathena was someone in whom she could place absolute trust.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now", the assassin continued, "we come to the reason for this encounter.  As your keen mind has already surmised, I have been commissioned to kill you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Even though she already knew it, the revelation still came as a shock, Jenira found herself braced against the bedpost as Janice continued, "However, only I chose the time and place of death, and I do not chose to take you now.  I have watched you Jenira, from afar, for many years, from the gutters of Lucia to the Imperial Court, from the ear of the Emperor to the bed of the rebel princess.  Never, in all my years as nemesis, have I met your equal.  You have the mind of a master general, the body of an athlete and the heart of a god.  In other ages, I would be glad to call you lover." The dark woman's face softened briefly, and for a fleeting moment Jenira saw a flash of the inner woman, hidden beneath the assassin's ruthless exterior.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"However", abruptly the vision was dispelled, "Dreams are for the fortune blessed, and we who are left must make our own way.  I have said that I do not chose to slay you now, yet sooner or later I shall take your life from you.  I give you now a chance I have never given before, to chose whether your life shall be measured in heartbeats", suddenly, with no warning, Janice's hands were bristling with poison tipped blades, "or years".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Abruptly the blades vanished, and she was sitting at the chessboard, an elaborately craven hourglass in her hand, beckoning Jenira to take the other stool, "Come, lay aside that dagger in your sleeve, play against me, in the greatest battle of all, and we shall see if your strategy can be any match for centuries of death". Slowly, measuring each pace, Jenira moved to sit opposite the assassin, and cast her eyes down to the pieces.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Janice had taken the black army, giving the first move to Jenira.  As the tactician examined the options, she noticed the individuality of the chess set, and wondered at their creator.  Each piece was a masterwork of sculpture, and Jenira had no doubt that the figures so exactly depicted in miniature were representations of real people. As she looked closer she recognised several from each side as folk out of legend, the matched pairs of athletic young men and women who stood ready as her pawns were clearly modelled on the long ago Atlantean castle guard, while the sable robed and iron crowned king of the assassin's forces must surely be the legendary witch king of the north, the sorcerer lord who had once held all the northern lands in thrall, until he fell to an assassin's enchanted dart. That thought led to another, and Jenira looked at Janice anew.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"These are all folk that you have slain", the assassin met her gaze, and suddenly Jenira understood the meaning of "centuries of death".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We play till the sand in the glass is done." Janice spoke once, set the hourglass beside the board, again the two women cast their gaze upon the pieces, and the battle of minds began.  Piece by measured piece the game was played, attack and counterattack, sacrifice and trap, as the two masters of strategy fought each other to a stalemate.  When the game could go no further, Janice re-set the board in an eyeblink, and they played anew.  Again and again the battle ended in stalemate, each player cutting her opponents force down, yet loosing pieces herself, until the game must start again.  Occasionally, one or other of them would seem to gain the upper hand, only to fall again to some new tactic or ancient gambit, as relentless time flowed, and the sand in the glass trickled away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Never in all her harsh and brutal past had Jenira faced such a challenge, and yet she met the task head on, learning from the assassin's moves even as she played, strategy after strategy flowing through the receptive channels of her mind, meeting and defeating attack after attack, until eventually, just as the first hint of false dawn touched the eastern sky, she forced the assassin to a checkmate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Victory is yours", Janice rose and bowed to Jenira, "for now, at least. One day I shall come again, but for now I will tell you this, you have much to do, with her", she tipped her head towards the still sleeping Eriahan, "at your side.  You two stand at a cross-roads, the fates of many thousands lie in your hands.  For now you have earned a respite, spend it wisely, for there is much pain still to come for you both."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The assassin had gathered her chess set and hour glass back into the folds of her cape while she spoke, now she faced Jenira squarely.  "One final gift", she thrust a plain gold ring into the tactician's hand, "wear this ring, and neither you nor your lover need fear any earthly assassin, save me".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Clasping Jenira's hand in her own, Janice slipped the ring onto Jenira's index finger, then she embraced the taller woman, and seized her mouth in a kiss that drained the power from her, until Jenira sank into restful oblivion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dawn brought panic to the camp of the Grand Duke, for though neither the guards nor the magic wards had hinted at any attack, his servants had found Lord Servastio slain in his bed, Eriahan's ceremonial spear of rank driven clean through his heart and deep into the oaken bedboards beneath.</p>
