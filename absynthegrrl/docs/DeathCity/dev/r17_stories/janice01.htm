<p class="regtxt5">Part One: The Fall of the House of de-Fey.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">DAMN!!!!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A single oath was all that entered the mind of Master Thief Irquis, as her dying, dark clad body plummeted to the ground below.  She was dead before she hit the cobblestones, killed by the crossbow quarrel in her chest, the same bolt who's unexpected intrusion had caused her to lose her grip on the balustrade of the royal palace balcony in the first place.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The thief's lifeless corpse slammed into the centre of the bazaar with a sickening wet thud, sending a flock of startled doves fluttering into the late evening sky.  For a moment, the bazaar was silent, as pleasure seekers and merchants alike gaped at the once elegant form sprawled bloody on the cobbles.  Swiftly, however the bazaar returned to it's business - in a city like Lucia, thieves were common, the death of one was a matter of little importance.  Within moments, a squad of the Guard with a bodycart arrived.  Swiftly the corpse was tossed onto the wagon, sand spread to cover the bloodstains, and Irquis was no more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Almost no one watched as the bodycart was wheeled out of the bazaar. Just one pair of bright eyes, peeping from beneath a tattered blanket, a beggar child, wraith like, perhaps twelve years old, clad in rags. Jenira, daughter of the beggar woman Irma de Fey, allowed a solitary tear to escape as the Guard carried the thief's remains down the alley she huddled in.  Irquis may have been a thief and a street fighter, but she had also been Jenira's protector, quick to share a morsel or a gift, where others shared naught but kicks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Guard were passing Jenira's pitch, a recess between two ancient buildings, a forest of leather clad legs, machine like before the child's gaze.  On impulse, she stood up, and called to them for a scrap - a foolish thing to do, for begging was illegal in Lucia, for all that beggars were everywhere.  This time, however, the child's impetuous nature paid off - one of the guards ripped Irquis's pendant from her broken neck and tossed it to Jenira.  Deftly she caught it, calling a blessing on the guards as they hurried out of sight down the narrow way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">From the rooftop above, another pair of unseen eyes watched the exchange, a brief smile flashed across aristocratic features, before the mysterious figure turned and vanished into the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Another hour Jenira begged coin in her alley, until the great bells of the citadel rang out the late night curfew, and the last of the night-traders closed up their stalls and left the bazaar.  With skill born of long practice she scaled the ancient wall behind her pitch, and vanished over it into the forgotten underworld beneath the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ancient was Lucia, ancient and corrupt, layer upon layer built over the ruins of the past. Beneath the maze of streets and alleyways known to the Guard were warrens and labyrinths of intersecting tunnels and sunken passageways, some used by thieves, some by beggars, and some known only to legend.  Swiftly Jenira threaded the maze of the underworld, all her keen senses alert for predators, down this passage, through that tunnel, emerging at last in the alley where her mother maintained their tiny lodging, a single attic room, reached by many flights of stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As always, Irma de Fey knew her daughter's footstep on the stairs, when Jenira reached the attic she found food awaiting her, bread, stale cheese, even a little meat.  She threw her arms around her mother and hugged her with all the love a twelve year old could muster, then sat down and wolfed the meagre meal. "What news of the bazaar today?", her mother asked, as Jenira devoured the food.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a moment, the girl paused, gripped by sadness. "Irquis is dead", she blurted out the plain truth.  "She was trying to enter the palace from the balcony above the bazaar, one of the guards must have seen her.  They shot her as she hung on the balustrade - she fell into the bazaar."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hunger satisfied, at least in part, she reached into her ragged cloak and produced her day's takings, three bronze coins, one silver, and a broken gold broach one of the palace servants had thrown to her.  Then, slowly, she pulled out Irquis's golden pendant.  Irma recognised it instantly, and pulled the child to her, now, at last, Jenira wept, face buried in her mother's bosom, tears unchecked flowing as she gave herself up to grief.  Irma just held her, silent, wondering how much of the truth to tell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jenira had lost a close friend and protector, but Irma knew how much more they had both lost when the Master Thief lost her gamble with life. Though Jenira knew it not, Irma de Fey had once been a courtier, matriarch of a noble house, still she kept hidden the papers that proved her bloodline back to the ancient kings of Lucia.  She had fled from that life, abandoning all, eleven years before, allowing herself to sink to the level of beggar rather than sacrificing her child to the sadism of the Duke of Servastio.  The Duke ruled Lucia now, the latest and bloodiest in a series of power hungry coup leaders.  Irquis also was of noble blood, first daughter of a house almost as old as Irma's.  Her family had retired from the city when the duke seized power, trusting to distance to keep his death squads at bay - a tragic mistake.  The duke wanted his power to be absolute, ruthlessly he, and now his son the
Marquis Servastio, had sought out and slain any who claimed ancient blood rights in the city.  Irquis alone had survived, as a loyal if wayward fosterling of Irma's, she had still been in the city when the duke's death squad burned her family alive in their own country house.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">But now Irquis was gone, and with her went Irma's last hope of survival. It was Irquis's thieving skills  that had kept the three of them one step ahead of the Marquis's ever vigilant spies, for he knew that Irma still lived, ever he searched to end her bloodline.  For now, she kept silent.  It was enough for Jenira to have lost her companion, whatever came after, nothing Irma said now could alter it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Eventually, Jenira's sobs slowed, then stopped.  Wiping her red rimed eyes on her sleeve she looked up at her mother's careworn features. "There's more", she said, "she was more than just a friend, wasn't she?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh child," Irma hugged her again, "how did you come to be so wise, so young?  Yes, there is more, much more, and I don't know how to begin to tell it to you".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a moment more she hesitated, part of her still clung to the noble ideas of a child's innocence, but then the practical took over, "How much innocence is their in the streets she begs in?". Slowly, haltingly, she told the tale, with frequent pauses while fresh tears welled up for the friends and relatives she had seen murdered and worse at the hands of the Servastio death squads.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time the tale was told, dawn was breaking over the city, the green tinged light of morning flitting across the rooftops.  Normally, that light would have sent Jenira scurrying back to her place by the pleasure bazaar, the pitch Irquis's fighting skills had won for her. Not today, however, nor ever again.  News travelled fast in the underworld, with her protector gone Jenira had no chance of holding such a plum position against the greedy and the violent.  There may well have been honour among thieves, but among beggars, there was none.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irma directed Jenira to rest, tucking her up in bed and closing the aged shutters against the morning light.  She waited in the lodging, her presence, comforting, finally allowing Jenira to drift into tearful sleep.  Once the girl was settled, Irma slipped out, leaving her daughter to sleep off her sorrow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The city bustled with life in the morning's coolness, as Irma flitted from alley to alley, carefully making her way to the bazaar of the beast traders.  She kept to the upper ways, while she knew of the underworld, even to knowing some of it's passages, she lacked her daughters speed and agility.  Soon enough the maze of intersecting ways led her to the arena she sought, and the house of Arawat, trader in riding beasts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hail, well met!" was the cry that greeted her as she entered the gloom of Arawat's premises, "What brings the Great Lady de Fey to my humble abode?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Arawat bowed low before her, oblivious to her disapproving start at his use of her title. "How many times must I beg you not to use that name aloud", she said, "or are you in the pay of the Duke, also?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Calm thyself", the brightly dressed trader replied, "think you that I would speak without caution - my walls are well warded, if any with ill intent were here, I would know of it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was an old argument, Arawat employed a minor mage to weave magical protections for his house and his beasts, and took pride in his defences, whereas Irma, who had long witnessed the corruption of the great mages of the high court, trusted little in magic.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well now I have come to settle our debt", Irma moved swiftly to the business that brought her here, "You have heard, no doubt, the fate of Irquis?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hear many things from many sources", he answered in a typical trader's riddle, "but, yes, I hear from the guild that Master Thief Irquis will be doing the rest of her thieving in the next world. Foolish", he shook his head in the dusty gloom, "foolish, to make so bold an entry to the palace.  Did she not know that the balconies are warded by the Duke's personal mage?  I doubt if even a Master Assassin could penetrate there undetected." Again, he shook his head, like Irma, he had known the dead thief personally, for all that he called her a reckless gambler he had admired her steel nerve and iron will.  She had broken more than one wayward horse for him, now he must find another young risk taker.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You speak of settlement", Arawat spoke again, "what manner of
accounting did you have in mind?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will give you five gold pieces", she reached into her cloak, and jingled a leather coin bag, "for two riding ponies, and two saddles".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Five pieces", he considered for a moment, calculating the true cost of the beasts she wanted, "Truly, I am in your debt over the matter of the duke's beasts, however I feel you put too high a price on that deed - I would need eight, at least, to balance the loss on the ponies".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Six, that is my last offer", now Irma's face hardened, "six gold, or we shall flee the city without your aid, and you may carry the debt to your grave".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Six it is", Arawat was shaken by her vehemence, truly he had no plans to cheat her, it was in a traders nature to drive a bargain, even she must know that, "and spare me your curses, All I ask is a fair trade".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry to have to be so blunt", she softened a bit, "but with Irquis gone we have at most three days to leave the city, and there are others I must deal with".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Forget it", he pulled out his trade book, and began to mark down the deal, "When do you want the beasts?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have them ready, here, tonight. I must find out which of the gate guards takes bribes at night, once I have that arranged, I shall come at once."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She handed him the pouch of coins, it did indeed contain six gold pieces, current issue, with the face of the Duke stamped neatly on them. She moved as if to go to the stable door, but he stopped her with a sign.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are watchers in the alley who were not there before", he said, reading his bought protections, "quick - through here". He led her to a pile of straw in the back of one of the horse stalls, beneath it a small door opened into an underpassage. "This comes out below the street of the swordmakers - be swift, for others may come".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She slipped gratefully into the darkness below, as he closed the door above her.  Moments later, as Arawat began to work on a damaged saddle, three dark figures entered the stable.  A few whispered words with the trader, an exchange of coin, and they left, sure of their man.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few hours later, careful words in the right ears told her that the West Gate would still open in the dark hours, for those who paid in advance.  The price was high, and not all in silver, but the woman's tastes were no stranger than others she had paid during her years as courtier, and she left the guardswoman's tavern room secure in her plan.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jenira still slept when Irma returned to their lodging, silently, Irma packed their few possessions, and her papers, before resting herself. That very night they would flee to the West, the road Irma had never
dared take while Irquis still lived.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"> *              *               *</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Across the city from Irma's lodging, in another attic room, the four surviving priests of the Order of the Sacred Rose gathered in grim solemnity.  The last survivors of an order butchered and ravaged by a blood path mage, they now sought vengeance, and an end to their own sorrow.  At the time arranged, their door opened, and Golgathena, the world's greatest assassin, Slayer-of-Angels in the common tongue, stood before them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A slight figure, perhaps a touch over five feet tall, dressed in black leather and black silk, her face masked as was common to women of noble birth, her long red hair flowing free behind her, she was not at first glance a figure of terror.  Not, that is, until the watcher began to take in the details, her poise, how she was alert to her surroundings until she was part of them, and then, on closer, if reverent, inspection, her costume, the handles of the throwing knives protruding from her boots, the matched sword and daggers at her belt, and then the hints of other weapons concealed about her person.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a long moment no-one spoke, as the four priests saw, and understood, who they had invited to their chamber.  Then she spoke, greeting them in their own words, "Hail, Acolytes of the Rose, Keepers of the Thorn. Blessings of the Sacred Garden be thine".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And may the bounty of the harvest be upon you", In unison, they responded in kind, automatically completing the ritual greeting before any of them realised she was not of their faith.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What know you of the Way of the Planter", their leader asked,
recovering his composure swiftly, "are you of our faith then?".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My belief is my own council", she answered, quietly, "yet I know of many faiths, living and long dead.  I am Nemesis, my knowledge is my power".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Abruptly she was seated at their table, her poise softer, understanding and even a little sorrow replacing arrogance and power.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know of your sorrows", she spoke again, in a softer, almost musical voice, "your brethren lie butchered, your temple defiled, your gardens destroyed.  I know why this was done, and by whom.  What do you seek of me?".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There, in one sentence, she had said all there was to be said about their current state.  The leader of the four glanced quickly at his companions, folded his hands in the symbol of the holy flower, and uttered one word.  "Vengeance", he said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you willing to pay my price?", she asked, looking each one of them directly in the eye, and appearing to see into their souls.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Our lives", the leader spoke again.  "Our lives, to you, forfeit for vengeance and destruction on the one who defiled us.  Yes, we will pay your price."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a long moment she locked them in her gaze, one at a time, reading their souls, feeling the depth of their pain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I accept your commission", softly she spoke, drawing out their pain, seeing it unite the four in purpose, "however what I will ask of you may not be what you expect".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Abruptly, the mood in that little chamber changed, with her acceptance they had been welded to their purpose, geas bound - whatever she asked of them now, they would willingly grant.  Though she was not of their faith, somehow each of them knew that she was one worthy of absolute trust.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you require of us?", their leader asked her, now meeting her level gaze, as might a trader treat with a merchant.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This night I shall have need of great power, and dark magic.  Powers are moving, the world is changing, and your vengeance is but a small part of the greater game now afoot.  Power and magic I have already, the lady I serve is generous with her gifts, yet if you would have true vengeance, unite now, summon the powers of your own lord, run the rites of your greatest rituals, and keep them running from now till true dawn. Your power I shall tap in the name of your vengeance, and the world shall know what passes in Lucia.  What say you?".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Again she held each in that cool, measuring gaze. As one, they met her sea green eyes, and accepted her price.  A moment later, and she was gone, as the last priests of the Order of the Thorn lit their candles and set up their sacred instruments.  Another moment, and the four took their places around the table, linked their powers, and invoked their god.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*               *               *</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In a great circular chamber, one floor from the top of the westernmost tower of the great palace of Lucia, Levenne-de-Mar, Arch-Mage to the Grand Duke Servastio, mistress of the dark arts and by her own skills the master of a dozen magical systems, summoned a page boy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Go to the Duke, tell him I have located his missing De-Fey."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the lad scampered out of the chamber and lightly down the spiral stair built into the outer wall, Levenne turned back to her great scrying crystal, seeing within it's depths, visible to her alone, a perfect re-creation of Arawat's stable in miniature.  The spell that enabled her to spy so was a demanding one, linked into the protections bought by the trader from a sub-mage under her control, just maintaining it drained a goodly portion of her personal energy, yet she knew that the Grand Duke Servastio would reward her highly if she could by her arts guide his guards to the last survivor of the ancient house De-Fey, his sworn enemy, and the only living human with a valid claim to his title.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Secretly, in that hidden chamber of her mind she kept warded with the greatest magics at her command, Levanne quietly wondered how the city would have fared were it Irma de Fey, instead of the duke, who ruled from this ancient palace.  Servastio had climbed to power over the slaughtered bodies of the old order, employing all and any means at his command, treachery, murder, even blood-path magic, in his relentless and brutal rise to the rulership.  He was wise enough to understand that all power ultimately depended on trade, the taxes he imposed on the merchant classes were high yet not intolerable, and so the city prospered, but his blood-lust and endless quest for absolute power brought untold misery to any who he even briefly considered might be a threat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still, in this much he was little different in life to the powerful men and women who ruled the other cities of this eastern empire, and Levanne was wise enough to align herself with the ascendant power.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Within the scrying crystal Irma, accompanied by a girl child of about 12, entered Arawat's stable.  The trader was awaiting her, two ponies stood saddled and ready in the lamplit gloom beyond him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So", Levanne thought to herself, "Irma de Fey has a daughter?
Interesting...".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Abruptly the Duke was at Levanne's side, the commander of the Guard behind him, keen for news.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My Lord", Levanne bowed to the Duke, "I have located your lost De Fey".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good work!", the Duke, for all his fearsome reputation, wa lavish with his praise of those few he truly trusted, "Now, where shall we find her?".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She is with Arawat, trader in riding beasts, in the old town near the bazaar of the weaponsmiths", smoothly Levanne answered, "she collects a riding pony, it seems she has had enough of Lucia".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The old town?", the Duke pondered for a moment, "Twice before the Guard have been thwarted by her in that maze, I will not make the same mistake again".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He turned to his commander, "Kevran, take six squads of your best men. Lay a perimeter between the Old Town and the West Gate.  See to it that you have watchers in the lower ways, though I doubt she'll try that route.  When you find her, you may cripple her if necessary, but do not kill her".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He turned again to Levanne, "I trust you have a pair of stones ready?".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes my lord", she answered, carefully opening a small drawer in her worktable beneath the scrying crystal, and extracting two perfectly-matched ovals of dark grey stone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The duke took the stones, an handed one to Kevran.  The commander took it reverentially, and carefully transferred it to a small pouch on the inner face of the neck of his uniform tunic, where it could press against his skin.  Taking a fine needle from his own pouch, and leaning his head to the side, he pricked his neck next to the stone and allowed a drop of blood to touch the dull grey surface.  The duke did the same thing with the second stone, and abruptly the two men could communicate mind-to-mind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The duke's face seemed to gain a ruddy glow as he contemplated finally erasing the De Fey bloodline from the city, "I have unfinished business with this one.  Bring her to the torture chambers".</p>

<p class="regtxt5"> *              *               *</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Bazzar of the Weaponsmiths stood at the centre of a maze of narrow, twisting alleyways, the heart of the ancient Old Town of Lucia. Evening always seemed to come early in the Old Town, as lanterns were lit and lengthening shadows merged into pools of darkness between the uneven buildings.  Hardly anyone noticed the slight, dark-clad figure stalking cat-like round the edge of the bazaar, flitting from shadow to shadow, and those few suddenly found their attention taken by some other incident, and quickly forgot ever seeing the slim woman in black.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As night fell across the city, even as Irma and Jenira arrived to collect their mounts from Arawat's stable, Janice trod silent, surefooted through the maze of the underworld.  Down forgotten stairways and along passages unknown even to the Thieves Guild, steadily she made her way to a hidden chamber buried in the foundations of a tall, narrow house near the eastern edge of the Old Town.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Originally built as a town-house by a wealthy silk trader six hundred years before, the solidly constructed timber frame building had seen many uses down the centuries, now it served as the mage-tower and dwelling place of the mage Mervyn deLante, a rising star of the Sorcerer's Guild. It was Mervyn who provided the spells warding Arawat's stable, it was also Mervyn who's blood-magic laid waste to the gardens of the Priests of the Rose, though he had been careful to ensure that no knowledge of that incident ever reached Lucia.  Some suspected him of at least dabbling in blood-power, to the sensitive he always seemed to have a faint taint of it, though he claimed that came from fighting and defeating blood-path mages in magical duels.  Levanne de Mar knew, for her greater skill had penetrated his protections and read at least some of the truth of his powers, but as he was of more use to her as a sub-mage she had seen to it that the knowledge went no further, once he had bound himself to her service.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mervyn had failed, however, to completely erase his tracks.  Janice knew.  Invisible even to mage-sight, protected by her Goddess and on a completely different mission, she had witnessed the slaughter of the Temple of the Rose.  As an ageless assassin, death seldom troubled her, yet even after all the ages she'd lived through, still she held to her ancient core beliefs, among which was that innocents should not be slain for the power or gain of another.  So when the survivors sought an assassin to bring vengeance, it was she who answered their call.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Safe within the hidden chamber, and with the door she'd entered barred against any who might follow, Janice knelt on the dirt floor, bowed her head, and invoked her goddess.  Mervyn was about to pay the true price of his blood magic.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was no sudden transformation, no avatar of fire, yet when Janice raised her head once again it was as if she glowed with some inner light.  Ancient, ageless, all but vanished from even the most learned minds, the Forgotten Goddess once more entered the mind of her chosen disciple, as a shaft of light entering a millpond.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hail and welcome", Janice silently projected.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hail my daughter", the lady laughingly replied, mind to mind.  "I see we have much work to do this night, come, let us be once more Chaos' servants!".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So saying the goddess threw her own protections arround Janice's mage-spells, drawing on the steadily rising pool of magical energy the priests of the Rose were filling with their continuous ritual.  Janice took a moment to steady herself mentally, having a goddess riding pillion on her shoulder, even after all these years, was not something for the faint hearted, and then she reached up, found the hidden passage to the upper house, and began to climb.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Three floors above, standing at the centre of his magical empire, Mervyn deLante was deep in a mental bond with Levanne.  Unknown to Arawat, the protection spells he'd bought from Mervyn had some useful additional functions, one of which was that they granted to Mervyn the ability to mentally "follow" anyone out of the stable and for a considerable distance beyond.  For this to work Mervyn had to be consciously driving the spell in it's active state before the target left the stable, hence why he'd merely reported Irma's visit to Levanne previously, but this time the spell was active and he, and she, were ready to invisibly follow their quarry, reports to be relayed to the Guard via the speaking-stones Levanne had prepared.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The twisting, secret stairway hidden in the fabric of Mervyn's house had lain unknown and unused for the last three centuries.  Vast cobwebs, heavy with decades of thick, heavy dust, all but choked the narrow shaft, and crumbling timbers threatened treachery with every step, yet slowly, carefully, upwards the lithe assassin climbed.  Her breath warded with a fine scarf across her face, testing each step, weighed down with ancient spider-silk and black soot, feeling her way with magic alone, upwards she went.  The hidden way had been craftily concealed within a solid block of timbers which formed one of the main supports of the building.  Passing the ground floor, it was buried deep in a solid wall, that no hint of it's presence might show.  At first floor level, there had once been a low door, beneath a shelf at the back of a cupboard, however at some point in the passing centuries that cupboard had been re-built as part of the armoury, and the little door now gave only onto more solid timber.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The second floor contained Mervyn's great chamber, the heart of his magical empire.  The hollow support column actually rose through one corner of the chamber, tapering inwards towards the third floor and roof above, while the outer walls of the house had been cantilevered out over the street.  Mervyn's own shield-spells cut through the hollow shaft at second storey floor and ceiling levels, yet some ancient passive magic in the building's construction had blinded him to the shaft's true nature.  Janice could feel those shields just above her head, pulsing with energy, driven hard as Mervyn sealed himself away from any prying magics his competitors might deploy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mervyn's shields were good, but like all his works, they had blood magic at their core.  Smoothly, aided by her own Goddess' powers, Janice reached into the lattice of pulsing power above her, and aided by her own blood magic, driven by the life-powers of those to whom her touch had been a blessing, she allowed her mental 'hands' to trace the lattice to it's twisted core, and then with a subtle hint of power, she opened herself a minor gateway in the floor of the shield, and held it open just long enough for her physical self to climb the last few steps to the ledge that served as a landing for the passageway, within the column, within Mervyn's great chamber, and within his shield-spells. Carefully she unwove herself from the angry red feeling of the pain and death-driven power, and released the lattice to re-take its natural form, once again sealing the passageway below her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mervyn, focussed as he was on following Irma, was completely unaware of the Assassin's presence.  High in her mage-tower in the Duke's palace, Levanne faintly felt the swirling and shifting of the blood-magic enwrapping Mervyn's domain, quickly she scanned his shields from within. For a fleeting moment she thought she caught the echoes of a collapsing magical doorway, yet they were so faint as to be almost undetectable, and a deeper scan found nothing but blood magic and swirling patterns, so she dismissed her caution and returned her focus to Mervyn's watch-spell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly, carefully, Janice again allowed her own magical senses to reach out, linking with and weaving themselves into Mervyn's overall magical controls.  This part, at least, was easy, for all his apparent ability, the sub-mage's work was coarse and unsubtle.  Little wonder he had resorted so often to blood magic, for a good tenth of his available power was simply draining away through shoddily constructed magical junctions, indeed as she wove herself deeper into the lattice, Janice had to take care to see that none of her own energies were likewise drawn off into the countless minor sinkholes she found within his structures.  Nevertheless, she persevered, and with the passage of a few brief moments she had sufficient linkage to be able to invoke her own witchsight and 'see' invisibly into Mervyn's workings.  Immediately she found herself looking down into Arawat's stable, where a woman and a child, swathed in shapeless black, mounted a pair of sturdy riding ponies.  That the beasts were of quality breeding was immediately obvious to Janice, and she wondered who the beggarly woman might be that could command a Lucian beast trader to part with such.  The assassin
also was aware of Levanne, as a hovering spectre of power, just beyond yet linked deeply to Mervyn's power structure.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is more to this than meets the eye", she caught the faintest hint of her lady's bright voice in the back of her mind, "watch closely and be ready my dearheart".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Clearly the woman in the scrying crystal had completed her trade, for she urged the child to mount and precede her out of the stable, and Janice gave a mental start as the woman drew a curious, yet infinitely familiar sigil in the air as she laid a geas on the child to flee westward should anything befall her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That sign, is she one of ours, then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes my daughter, it would seem that more wisdom than even I suspected lives still in the house of de-Fey.  Do all you can, but exact a fair price".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Janice continued to expand her magical grasp of Mervyn's energies, and now he began to notice that something was amiss.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My lady", he sent to Levanne via their shared link, "something else moves this night".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Again the greater mage inspected Mervyn's shields, and this time she did detect the gossamer-fine tendrils of Janice's own weaving.  She did not, however, guess their true nature, for to her sight they too appeared as the rest of Mervyn's work, blood-driven.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It would seem your blood bought powers are not entirely at your command", she sent back, "however your shielding troubles are not of my concern.  Blood magic always has its price, you can deal with whatever you have loosed once tonight's work is done".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So saying, she commanded Mervyn back to the task at hand, and bound to her as he was he had no choice but to obey, even as he felt the intruder's thought-strands ever extending reach probing, linking with, and penetrating his own control nodes.  Even he failed to see them for what they truly were however, taking them for little more than the residue of one of the many lesser blood mages who's life energies he had consumed in his own rise to power.  After all, nothing had penetrated his shielding, he was safe within his own protections.  "Indeed", he thought to himself, "once this work is done it will be a pleasure to devour whatever remains of this insolent remnant".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irma and Jenira rode swiftly yet almost silently west through the watchful darkness of the Old Town, away from Arawat's stable and towards the distant Westgate.  As the crow flew the distance was a bare half mile, yet through the twisting and intersecting streets that distance was at best doubled, while by the looping route Irma took, branching and changing direction to confuse any who might follow, it was almost doubled again.  Meanwhile, guided with unerring precision by the Duke's orders relayed through the blood-stone link to Kevran, the Duke's elite guard, led by the Marquis Servastio himself, their force arrayed to intercept Irma's path in the wider streets of the merchant quarter by the Westgate, slowly but surely closed in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At last, after what seemed an age yet was in reality just a few moments of time, Janice had completed her own control lattice within Mervyn's works.  She now had a linkage to every magical node and element within Mervyn's magical domain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For three hundred years the mage-hidden door from the upper chamber into the hidden stairway had lain disused, yet at the touch of Janice's own spell it swung smoothly and silently open.  One, two steps forward and she stood on the floor of Mervyn's great chamber, draped in ancient spider silk, the scarf falling from her face as her right hand levelled her small yet powerful crossbow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Startled, Mervyn jerked upright as she loosed the bolt, as it slammed into his body and pierced his heart he heard her words, "So die all who would defile the keepers of the Thorn!", his dying vision was of her soot-stained face superimposed on the great rose of the Planter's God.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The shock of Mervyn's death was still reverberating up the disintegrating yet still active link to Levanne as Janice poured all the power at her command into the lattice she had built within the dead mage's structures, simultaneously rupturing and igniting every fragment of his construction.  Power unstoppable ran in every direction, each exploding spell backlashing power back up it's own linkages in a vast chain reaction.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Across the city screams rang out as buildings, Arawat's stable among them, erupted in unquenchable flame as their bought protections imploded in incandescent fury. As the spells collapsed, their residual power backlashed through the energy grid, with a great roar the upper two stories of Mervyn's house blasted skywards in a great eruption of scarlet and purple fire, scattering blazing timbers and burning oil across a dozen surrounding houses.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The floor of Mervyn's great chamber, held in place by magic as well as building work, survived the explosion, though magical fires ate at the timbers and the structure would clearly not stand for long.  In the centre, by Mervyn's blazing corpse, on an iron stand stained with blood, Mervyn's scrying crystal, heart of his disintegrating power-lattice and anchor of his link to Levanne, stood among the flames.  Though she knew not what or who she faced, the Duke's mage had wisdom enough to throw herself away from her own crystal and down the tower stairs as the collapsing energy of all of Mervyn's spells finally backlashed into the focal point of his domain, however her master was not swift enough to follow and thus the Grand Duke Servastio, and through their blood-stone
link, Kevran of the Guard, died in the flames as the entire upper section of the western tower of the Palace of Lucia blazed into incandescent orange fragments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just beyond the borders of the Old Town, where one of the twisting thoroughfares gave onto a wide avenue bordered by merchant's halls, the men and women of Kevran's own platoon fought to get clear as their leader was instantly turned to fire upon his own horse.  The beast screamed and bucked as it's rider burned with white heat, maddened with unbearable pain it lashed out with iron-shod hooves at all who stood within reach before galloping madly forwards, into the old town and all but running down Irma and Jenira as it blasted across their path.  The galloping horse with it's blazing rider terrified their normally sturdy mounts, they had themselves galloped three blocks north from the road Irma had planned to take before she and Jenira were able to bring them to a heaving stop.  Thus, by the narrowest of chances, they evaded Kevran's squad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Meanwhile, flames from many premises formerly warded by Mervyn's spells leapt skyward, Lucia's landmarks and towers standing stark against the sullen orange glow, as desperate people hastily beat at the flames threatening to engulf whole districts.  Rumours already flew through the night of the grim and terrible assassin who had stalked, seemingly unharmed, from the blazing ruins of Mervyn's house, only to vanish in the darkness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mother, what does this mean?", Jenira asked in an awe-struck voice once they had calmed their beasts and dismounted beneath an archway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know not", Irma responded, seeing the orange glow from somewhere behind them tingeing the upper floors of the houses on the other side of the street, and smelling the growing horror of smoke upon the air, "but whatever the cause, it would appear our road was blocked ahead of us. That rider", she paused and drew a holy sign in the air to ward off evil, "was one of the Duke's men".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irma reached out and grasped her daughter's hand, "You must promise me that you will run.  If anything happens, if there is trouble, run, child, run.  West is your path, west and north, to the Islands of Mist. Promise me, Jenira, promise me you will go".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a long moment Jenira said nothing, holding her mother's hand and wishing with all her heart for things to be as they were before, but then her young-old wisdom reasserted itself, and she nodded her assent. "North and west to the Islands, in Duty I shall go".  It was the second part of the ancient geas Irma had begun in the stable, and Irma knew that despite Jenira's youth, she would obey it, though the pain should the geas be needed would be cruel.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For several moments more the mother and daughter lingered beneath the archway, while their mounts recovered from their fear, before setting out once again for the Westgate.  They almost reached it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A jingle of armour was all the warning Irma had, yet it was enough, she wheeled her mount and placed herself squarely between the guard platoon and Jenira just as the first crossbow fired.  The bolt buried itself in Irma's horse's heart, the beast screamed once and fell to it's knees as Irma shouted "run, girl, run", and grabbed for her own weapons.  She never got a chance to use them, as a dozen more bolts ploughed their bloody way into her dying pony and her own legs, pinning her in place and filling her with agony as Jenira, geas bound yet also bound by love to her mother, screamed behind her. With a heave the pony died, throwing itself sideways and crushing Irma's right leg beneath it's weight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The commander of the guard platoon, Tercia, a hawk-visaged woman, veteran of many campaigns and with a deep distrust of magic, strode towards Irma, her people following warily.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Take the girl!", she ordered, and six of her troops broke away to obey, only to be abruptly cut down by a hail of black crossbow bolts that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time.  Suddenly Irma was no longer alone, beside her stood a slight figure wrapped in darkness, the harsh smell of the magical fires drifting from her clothing, the far deadlier reek of ancient power seeming to flow from her very being.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She faced Tercia boldly, and in a low growl uttered "Woman, if you value your life, flee this place".  Two of Tercia's remaining platoon, one man, one woman, started to raise their crossbows, the dark figure didn't seem to move yet abruptly there was a fine dagger in the assassin's hand and those two were cut down where they stood, blood momentarily oozing from the precise stab wounds as their hearts juddered to a halt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tercia opened her mouth to speak once more, then her courage utterly failed and she turned and fled, the survivors of her platoon at her heels.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irma was growing weak with pain and blood loss from her shattered legs, while Jenira, in deep shock at watching her mother's slow agony, skittered back and forth, her love warring with her geas for control of her mind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly Irma felt her pain recede, as if pushed back by some other force, abruptly she was aware of another in her mind, the strange dark woman.  For a moment Irma resisted the touch, until a faint voice as old as Summer whispered gently within her, "She is of your own path and she is my chosen.  Your faith in her put, failed she never has".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In an instant Janice had the full tale from Irma's slow-fading memory. Abruptly Jenira felt a gentle presence within her own mind, and suddenly the screaming agony of the alleyway released it's death-grip on her soul, she remembered her promise, and with tears falling like rain from her face she turned her mount and made for the Westgate ahead of her, an unseen shadow following silently behind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In common with most cities of the East, Lucia was no place for an unwary child at night, however few children had Nemesis for a guardian, thus it was that the headless bodies of two slave traders and one dealer in women of pleasure were added to the chaos of the city that night, while a horse-thief quickly found another beast to shadow when poison darts exploded with potentially deadly, yet strangely harmless, ferocity against the wall all around her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Abruptly Jenira was through the West Gate itself, the gate guards throwing open the oaken portals and throwing down their weapons at sight of the deadly figure that stalked the centre of the wide road behind the child as she rode past them.  Through the gate, across the great stone river bridge, and into the moonless darkness beyond Jenira rode, her inner self swathed in layers of gentle magic, her physical being warded by shields which threw the physical senses into confusion and warned those with witchsight to stand clear in power and language that even a greater adept would hesitate to challenge.  For the remaining few hours of this night at least, Jenira was safer than she'd ever been before.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irma knew she was dying, but she went to her death in peace at least, for she knew in her heart that the dark stranger would ward Jenira out of the city at least, and she knew there was simply no more she could do.  If the gods were willing, the child's nimble wits and natural guile would carry her west and north to the ancient sacred isles, where she might find a home at least among those who suffered not from tyrants such as Servastio and his son.  Irma knew she was dying, yet she came from an ancient noble lineage blessed with strength and long life, and death did not come swiftly.  Suddenly the dark stranger was back, at her side, and once again she heard that ancient and magical voice in her own mind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Irma de Fey, do you know me?", the voice said, and Irma felt a little of her strength return as she answered with the words her own grandmother had taught her decades before, "Lady, you are she who men forgot, yet whom we still remember in glory".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Irma de Fey, ancient of the noble house", despite her weakness and pain Irma felt her heart leap as the ancient Goddess, far above all worldly titles, honoured her own lineage with the all but forgotten wording, "this night your daughter has been saved by the hand of my chosen one". The dark woman bowed before her, "and it seems your child has charmed her, for she offers you a final gift".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The voice stopped, and Irma found herself looking into the dark woman's surprisingly concerned eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lady de-Fey", her gentle voice, rich with hints of distant lands, "the one we both serve offers you a final gift.  Will you freely give your own life in exchange for your child's safe passage to the West?".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Irma held Janice's gaze for a long moment, measuring the strength and sense of purpose she saw there, even through her again growing pain and weakness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes", she finally uttered, "I will give anything in my power, even unto my life, to see her safe to the Islands".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*       *       *</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Terror and panic anew spread like the wildfire engulfing parts of the city as the dead woman, mounted on a dead horse, and bearing two sacred symbols, the great rose of the Planter in her left hand, and a staff topped with a horned crescent, which few recognised but all fled from, in the other, rode slowly through the ruins to the great bazaar before the Palace of Lucia.  There on a rude cross the body of Levanne, slain and butchered by the Marquis Servastio, using enchanted weapons of his own, had been hoisted not an hour before.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Newly elevated to the Dukedom by his father's death, the new Duke had already ruled by decree that all magecraft was hither on punishable by death.  The mob was already gathering to hunt down the remaining magefolk in the city even as the fires of Mervyn's destruction continued to burn, yet to a man they fled screaming as Irma, or at least what had once been Irma, rode to the centre of the square, and with one hand threw down in ruin Levanne's cross before turning to face the palace, raising the two symbols high, and then exploding in a sheet of blue flame that left nothing but bones and ashes where she and her horse had stood.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And so in the histories ended the ancient bloodline of de-Fey, for though Jenira, warded on her journey by Nemesis, reached the Western Islands in safety, never again did she use her mother's surname, or tell anyone of her parentage.</p>
