<p class="pagecaption">Death City - Kali, Early Past</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* about her past */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* talking about school and all */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You know, I just struck me the other day - high school really wasn't as bad as I wanted to believe. There were some good times and some good people there.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A curious kind of realization washed over her. I guess I was more wild that I thought. Shit, I slipped scotch into the jr. high play and substituted it for the ice tea. I skipped more classes in high school than I went to and still graduated with a decent grade point average. I hung out in the theatre instead of class. I ran with enough misfits that we kept each other sane. Tried smoking, drank, tried a few drugs, although my head was so scrambled then that the drugs weren't a good thing. Ducked under the radar of the teachers and principal, yet still skipped almost as much as the 'bad crowd'.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* about moving */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We moved when I was in 6th grade to a place where the kids were pretty clannish, although I made a couple good friends and even ended up being class VP that year. It was weird. Told me I really wasn't much suited to those activities..:)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* jr high */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Started to break away from the good kid model some. A friend and I convinced some really gullible kid we were robotic probes from the center of the galaxy.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lipped off once too often and learned abruptly that the power structure never was your friend. Got to watch those tactics you know. Better recon, better intelligence, and all that. Should have fought, but decided I didn't like the odds much. Took a while to forgive myself for it though.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Got to do things others never would like wiring in a dimmer system for the school play. Eating cat-food sandwiches, for real. One of the drama students was supposed to bring snacks one day and she made them out of cat and dog food cause it was cheaper. Funny thing was it didn't taste any different than the cheap human sandwich meats in a can...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Brought whiskey in and substituted it for the iced tea representing it in the play. That was fun, fortunately no one got so far gone that they couldn't handle their lines. The advisor probably caught it when everyone liked the iced tea for a change, but he didn't say anything more than don't do it again.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Oh yeah, and I forgot we put a listening device in the teacher's lounge. The av storage room was right next door and the smoke vent went out through it to the roof. So one weekend we slipped a microphone capsule into the vent and instant access. Didn’t hear much interesting stuff though.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris - Bugging the teacher lounge? Holy shit!</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - Yeah, well it would have been more fun if we could have caught some juicy stuff, rather than sports talk and grading stuff. Didn’t even hear anything about the trouble makers.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* about high school */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">That’s where I really learned to walk the shadow line. I have a brain and I test well, so I was lumped with the brain trust, but they were so boring. So I figured how to slip into the shadow line between being good and being bad. The place between where I wasn't bored with it but wasn't getting in trouble much either.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Survived through being part of the AV dept. with the other nerdy misfits. That and lots of theatre. Couldn’t get enough of it actually.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris - Theatre huh? What parts did you play?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - tech theatre, behind the scenes mostly, though i did a couple of bit parts cause i liked to read... it's a chance to get outside yourself for a while. something that was really important back then.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Didn’t find out until a good friend of mine was about to graduate that the reason I had it so easy was I had a reputation of being extremely dangerous. I still don't exactly understand it. Maybe it was the time in jr. high when I held someone against their locker, about half a foot off the floor, choking them cause they bugged me once too often and it was a bad day. (Looks embarrassed) kind of like the firefight on the rescue, snapped over into that other place where things become just targets and obstacles. It scared me silly, still kind of does...to know I could do that and not really remember parts of it after...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris - Wow. How do you get off saying you've led a boring life? Boring is the good kid who goes to class, gets good grades, goes to college and settles down. Did you do any of that? I didn't do half what you did and I was considered a troublemaker in Duluth. All I did was skip a few classes, get caught with alcohol on school grounds, get caught smoking a few times, and try and swipe a necklace I really wanted. Sure there's the punker look I had when I was singing with the band, but we never caused any trouble.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - Yeah, well we really didn't either.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris - And choking somebody isn't trouble?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - Well they never complained to the school and no adults caught the action, so...no trouble.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - grinning lopsidedly - Besides, it's not illegal if you don't get caught.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris - taken aback - umm...but, I don't...uh, that is...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - expression turning troubled - don't worry. I use that one mostly to shake people up. I have a bunch of lines I won't cross, even if I could be sure I wouldn't get caught.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris - ok...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - though it reminds me of a conversation or something...balance is the most important thing. not good, not evil, but the balance between all things.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on high school 2 */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Flying up to see friends and a lover during weekends, working at the local department store. Being crazy and weird and just having fun with it all</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* college */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Got into a serious relationship way too fast. One that turned from good, to ok, to bad and giving away the resources to make it better.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on parents */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - They tried, I guess. They weren't deliberately mean or evil or anything. They just didn't have a clue. I know all they wanted to do was make sure I wasn't an arrogant bitch, but instead they shredded what little was there. You know, it just doesn't matter much anymore, though it still hurts. I still wake up sometimes in the middle of the night convinced I’m the worthless thing they told me I was. My brain knows they were wrong, I just wish my heart would remember.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - Sometimes I need the madness, I need the pain, otherwise it all seems too.. shit I don't know what I mean.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris - the edge</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - yeah, the edge. I wanted to feel safe, that's all I ever wanted. But there isn't any not really...so I let that need keep me from so much I would have tried. Even now it sometimes claws at me. When I take Leopardess out it still claws at me. It’s only the thought of those I go to rescue that gives me a way to overcome it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on parents 2 */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* letter to parents - not to be sent */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I am curious what you wanted to accomplish with the fire and brimstone religion and the reminders of not being strong or capable. Did you want to make me a rational productive member of society? Did you want me to be happy and well balanced?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I see the results daily in the mirror and wonder what you were hoping for. I am hoping the results weren't what you wanted, I’d like to think you weren't that deliberately cruel.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the results:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">religion is the greatest force for evil the world has ever known</p>
<p class="regtxt9">it is followed closely by capitalist/corporate greed and governmental self serving</p>
<p class="regtxt9">power structures are suspect and serve only themselves</p>
<p class="regtxt9">groups of people are to be feared and avoided</p>
<p class="regtxt9">people cannot be trusted</p>
<p class="regtxt9">why try anything? failure/poor performance is the inevitable outcome anyway and failure is not acceptable, even when learning</p>
<p class="regtxt9">anything can be done better by someone else so why value personal achievement</p>
<p class="regtxt9">people won't like assertiveness even if a decision has to be made - don't be the assertive one</p>
<p class="regtxt9">people do good only out of fear of being caught/punished - it's not illegal if you don't get caught</p>
<p class="regtxt9">good sense of right/wrong though - don't screw other people just cause you can</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the good news - I am getting past some of these</p>
<p class="regtxt9">people can do good just because they want to</p>
<p class="regtxt9">people can sometimes be trusted - just don't let them in too rapidly</p>
<p class="regtxt9">try things anyway - failure is an ok option, just decide afterward whether to try again or move on</p>
<p class="regtxt9">some assertiveness is valued and necessary to get what is wanted</p>
<p class="regtxt9">even if someone else can do something better it is valuable to do it for oneself</p>
<p class="regtxt9">groups are ok if you know enough of the members individually</p>
<p class="regtxt5">others have not changed</p>
<p class="regtxt9">religion is still the biggest force for evil and should have NOTHING to do with real world laws</p>
<p class="regtxt9">governments are not our friends and should be reduced in power whenever possible</p>
<p class="regtxt9">safety and security are neither - they only protect those in power</p>
<p class="regtxt9">all the justice money can buy is how it really works</p>
<p class="regtxt9">large corporations should similarly be broken up and disassembled routinely</p>
<p class="regtxt9">it's not illegal if you don't get caught</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on parents 3 */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Creation of firestorms and after-effects</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What I wanted so long ago was someone to hold me and tell me it was going to be ok. But it never really happened. So it still howls in there. Angry, frightened and in pain, it screams for what it never got. I have no idea how to help it. That’s the irony. At the end of it all I’m still a kid who wasn't held when it hurt.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* parents 4 - not to be used currently */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - on growing up - "Susan was right, I wouldn’t have survived if I had been what I should have been. I wouldn’t have had the disconnects that allowed me to survive. It was the ability to distance myself from their words and actions that let me escape. I may not be thriving, but I at least survived."</p>
