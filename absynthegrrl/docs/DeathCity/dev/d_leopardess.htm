<p class="regtxt5">Notes on table</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Class 3766 was the first idea for Kali's locomotive. It was too small for the final train. For the stories Kali will have noticed the prototype for the K-666 series instead.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">The K-666 class is based on a hybrid of the Baldwin #227 locomotives used by Duluth, Missabe, and Iron Range RR to haul ore, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Pacific_Big_Boy">Union Pacific American Locomotive Big Boy class</a>. Kali has redesigned the rebuild using advances in materials and engineering practices to get the best performance out of her series of locomotives.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">The tender has been re-designed to use fuel oil instead of coal. For Leopardess, K-666 (first Loco of series - thus class number), the tender was designed with a narrow passage to allow Kali to get back to the rest of the train. This design element is carried through when it becomes apparent these locos will be used in single engine configuration more often than in multiple engine modes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali rebuilds the cab as a combination of <a href="../../../common/item_images/k666_Backhead_original.jpg">original equipment</a> and latest electronic enhancements for guidance and control. She tends to run the void with obscure mix of soundtrack, Celtic, metal, and industrial music thundering through the cab at ear-shattering levels. Many of her crew have noticed and commented to her and each other about this.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* might use this as a spring board for a mission or two for a small number of people to gather information or missing parts to restore her engine */</p>
