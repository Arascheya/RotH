<p class="regtxt5">/* first roof top run - cut from After the void */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Restlessness drove her from room to room, then to the closet for clothes. While she was dressing her thoughts turned briefly to food, then quickly away again as she realized she was too wound up to eat. She snarled in frustration and stalked to the bedroom where she pulled on a black top and black jeans. Half way out the window she paused then drew herself back into the room. Quickly she composed a quick note to Sammi and Jemima, ran down stairs and posted it on the door to her building. Still restless, she started to walk out into the early evening when the sounds of a group walking on the road drifted to her. Unreasoned terror drove her half way back up the stairs, before she even knew it. She paused long enough to realize she didn't want to see anyone, then returned to her rooms and headed back out the window.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The restless energy coursing through her pulled her into a run and before she even thought about it she was into a leap from her roof to the next one over. This time she had no fear of the drop. Landing lightly, she scampered for the next roof, then the next, and the next. Memories of the rage that drove her attacks earlier in the day fueled her restless energy until she was running flat out between leaps from building to building. Her energy drove her until she came to one of the central park areas of the city. There she ran out of rooftops and breath. Breathing in ragged gasps she slid to a halt at the edge of the last roof.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For a few moments she stood and surveyed the scene in front of her. Here and there gas lamps lit the streets around the edges of the park. Horse drawn carriages moved slowly past, some letting people off, others picking them up. Several groups moved into the trees of the park. In the distance fires gleamed in the shadows of the stately old trees. Overhead the moon drew a silvery blanket over it all.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A surge of energy pulled her closer to the edge of the roof. A sudden impulse drew her into an arcing dive-roll off the edge. It ended in her landing coiled on the street below. A quick spring up and slightly forward dissipated the energy locked in her muscled crouch. She stalked silently through the shadows to the trees and then slipped into them, working her way deeper into the park. Always she held back in the shadows, listening to snippets of conversations and easy laughter dancing in the night. Pangs of loneliness fought with the fear of strangers as she stalked the shadows.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In time she tired of the fight and turned her steps back toward the streets and buildings of the city. Slowly she edged her way through the darker streets and alleyways back toward her building. Architectural styles surged and broke against each other like waves on a restless sea. Fascinated she wandered a looping, spiral path back toward the cathedral and her home. She would often find her attention drawn by the odd juxtapositions of different styles, or an interesting bit of tracery here, or an odd bit of structure there. Several hours after leaving her place she was back to the streets nearby.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A large group approached as she neared her home, probably coming from the Adam and Eve. Quickly she ducked into the alleyway behind her building, only to be brought up short as a woman’s voice said, "Ye need not fear them. Ye be safe in Death City and in all Eternia from the rest of us. It be only yourself ye need fear."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Startled, Kali snapped out, "What do you know of me?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ye be one of the rare ones. Ye walk the shadow line by choice, that be why ye have the hand of the Dark Mother on ye. Ye did not die to come here. Your transition is a different one, it be of flesh and spirit. Yet e’ en so, ye be less than comfortable in yer skin."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shadow walker, fence rider, great, another place where I'm too much in the center to be valid. What gives you the right to judge me?!?" she spat out, her face twisted into a sneer by bitterness.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ye don't understand, do ye girl? Here Shadow Walkers have a place. Ye walk between worlds here, as ye walked between extremes and between genders in the realms. This is the place between, a place where the tasks of salvation and rescue are taken seriously. Balance and center are very important. Here those that understand Between have the best time of it. Here ye be judged only by how ye aid those around ye. Here ye be safe from all but yourself. Beyond these borders though, that be a different matter. The forces of evil will seek to destroy ye, to prevent ye thwarting them. The forces of good may walk over ye, confusing ye with the evil uns. Always the Dark Mother watches over, she who was before the Others. But here I'm chattering on like some crazy magpie and ye be cold of spirit. Go, find yer friends and let them warm you. Old Lizbet be here when ye want to talk again girl. This alley be my home."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Strangely calmer after her conversation with Lizbet, she emerged back into the street and turned her steps to the Adam and Eve. She didn't see the old woman shimmer and fade into the night. She found she was flinching less when groups passed her. Even the trip from the door of the tavern to the table by the fire didn't evoke the apprehension she usually felt when crossing a crowded room.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Old Lizbet - second time - after visit to portal station</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The train deposited her back at Central Station. Walking through the mid morning sunshine she found herself lost in thought. Her footsteps took her to the narrow alley behind her building. She came out of her trance as Old Lizabet spoke, "Ye be troubled. Be it somethin ye’d like to talk about?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, I'm just not sure even what is bothering me so much. Things just seem to be happening really fast. There are so many different directions I can go here and I don't know how to deal with it..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ye be good at ignoring what really troubles ye too, aren't ye? You have an idea about most things, don't ye? What be really troubling ye?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked down at the cracked paving stones before softly answering, "Merris. I don't know what she wants. She’s attractive to me and it scares me. I don't think I'm ready for anything more serious than friendship. Maybe that’s all she wants, but..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ye think she wants more."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ye want more..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, no, I think so...I don't want to get entangled. I don't even know who I am right now, or what I'm doing."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Listen to yer friends. Stop thinking so much and let things happen as they may. Ye might become friends, ye might become more. Let it unfold as it will. If ye want more romance her and see what happens."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But I'm not ready!" She remained silent. Kali sank into thought, finally continuing, "But I guess people rarely are, are they..." Lizabet smiled. They sat in silence a while longer, then Kali rose and headed home.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Scenes from Death Is Only...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The scene faded for a moment and then there was the sharp bright splinter of pain. Red blossomed in the deep slice. For a moment the feeling of despair faltered. Then it firmed again as the knife rose and fell again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali jerked upriight as sympathetic pain throbbed in her wrists. She stared at them, convinced she would see the knife tracks. Her wrists were smooth and unmarked as always. "Fuck, fuck, fuck. Will this never stop?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">NOTE: Nanaja - Summerian and Akkadian goddess of sex and war</p>
