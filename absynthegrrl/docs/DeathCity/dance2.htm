<p class="pagecaption">Of Dance and Danger 2</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty minutes later her eyes snapped open. With a groan she tossed and turned on the bed. Everything hurt. The bed was hard and lumpy. The blankets scratched and irritated her skin. Her cuts ached and muscles cramped. Grumbling she hoisted herself out of the bed. Pain shot through her feet as she placed them on the floor. She focused on them until she could stand the pain as she slowly placed more weight on them until she was standing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The room was tiny. There was a small cubby desk and chair near the window. A closet and set of drawers were wedged in between the desk and the corridor wall. The fold down bed took up the other side wall. There was enough space to stand and maybe turn around between the bed and the cabinets.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Muscles screamed and protested until she moved. The movement seemed to help somehow. She did a couple of warm ups in the tiny space of the room. Her hand hit the wall when she tried to expand her motion. Snarling in frustration she stepped to the tiny clothes closet. Inside she found a scoop neck top that hung loosely on her frame but still didn't quite come to her waist. A ratty pair of jeans fit loosely around her, hanging low on her hips and ending above her ankles. For a moment she stopped in embarrassment, then gave a sharp laugh. The last outfit had shown the team more of her than the ill-fitting clothing did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali opened the door to the narrow corridor and made her way toward the communal car. She heard voices raised in argument as she neared the common room. "She's a loose cannon." Alisha was saying.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But her instincts are true. The opposition would have kicked our asses if she hadn't known where they were coming in." Anastasia countered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She doesn't listen and she doesn't follow instructions. I can't protect her if I don't know what she will do next. You saw it yourself when she ran off into that other building."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I never asked you to protect me," Kali said quietly from the doorway. Alisha turned red and looked away. Anastasia looked up in surprise. Lauren, Lissa, and Mark looked up from their card game.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aren't you supposed to be sleeping and staying off your feet?" Anastasia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can't." Kali padded across the floor to an empty area and began to run through various routines. It took her only a moment to adjust to the slickness of the bandages on her feet before she was moving at full speed. Anastasia and the others watched her in silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What the hell do you think you are doing?" Danny's voice blasted from the other corridor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dancing," Kali replied as she finished a pirouette.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'll tear things open and hurt yourself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This feels better than being still." She locked her toes tight and spun up onto their tips and kept going back down, making a mental note to not try toe stands barefoot in the future.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You need to stop now." Danny said again when he noticed the fresh red stains on the bandages on her feet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can't," she said again as she dropped back down onto the balls of her feet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're hurting yourself this way. You have to stop." Danny reached for her but she danced away from him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't. Adaptation reaction won't let me stay still. It's this or tear my skin off to stop the burning in my nerves."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny stopped and backed away from her. "At least promise me you'll let me check your injuries when you can stop." She nodded once. He joined Anastasia at her table and sat in silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali continued dancing until she neared exhaustion. She collapsed in the nearest chair, not wanting to fall down in front of the others. Pain from her torn up back forced her to sit away from the chair back. The restless fire sped in warm waves through her, but not quite intense enough to force her back to her feet. When Danny started toward her she pulled the top up, intending to take it off until she saw Anton turn red. She stopped with the hem half way up the under slope of her breasts and let Danny check the bandages. "I need to check your legs too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She dropped her top and stood. "I don't have a room."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stas, may we use yours?" Danny asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Use the empty one next to mine. I was going to assign it to Kali anyway." Anastasia replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They walked off down the corridor, crossed to the living car, and entered the compartment. Kali skinned out of her jeans and stood shameless in front of Danny. "Not modest I see. That makes it easier."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"First time ever I like how I look. Besides, I could rip your throat out before you could do anything wrong to me." Danny looked just a bit nervous until he saw she was smiling.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bandages on her legs showed no new blood spotting either. She sat back on the bench and presented her feet. Danny unwrapped them and stared. Fresh blood had spotted them yet the wounds looked sealed and in good shape. "Ok, I guess it hasn't hurt you to be dancing. Doesn't it hurt to be on your feet like that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled and pulled the jeans back on. "Not as much as laying under the covers did. I just feel beter when I'm in motion."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Make sure you eat right and sleep. How are you sleeping by the way?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Badly, if at all, the last couple of days. Before that I was doing fine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If it keeps up for more than a day or two longer, I'll find you something to help. How about eating?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks. I'm doing ok with eating. Anything else? I might be able to sleep a bit more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. I'll grab you one of those blankets from Anastasia's room." Kali eased onto the bed and closed her eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is your problem anyway?" Alisha asked from the doorway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My problem? And what exactly do you mean by that?" Kali asked from the bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have your own agenda. How can you think you are part of this team when you go off on your own? You endangered all of us with those stunts of yours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I endangered myself. You were still the same team you were before I came along. I made a decision based on what I thought."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you were right. So now you want to gloat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked at her with a puzzled expression. "Is that what you think? Would it help you to know I wanted to be wrong?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If I had been wrong it would mean the opposition wasn't getting more dangerous and nasty. I wanted to be made the fool."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Whatever," Alisha snarled as she walked away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry, she usually isn't like that," Danny stated as he gently placed the blanket over Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not even sure what I did to her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alisha's a control freak. It's what makes her a good second, but she expects things to be done a certain way. So far you haven't exactly fit that ideal."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Try not to worry about it for now. You'll find your place and she'll get used to you. Now, try to sleep. It's still two and a half hours back to Death City." Kali pulled the blanket around herself and let her eyes drifted closed.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Fifteen minutes later Kali's eyes snapped back open. With a snarled curse she flung herself out of bed. Frustration rolled off her in waves as she stalked to the lounge and flung herself into motion. Alisha started to say something to her but backed quickly out of the way when she saw the icy rage in Kali's grey eyes. She remained in motion until the train came to a stop at platform ten in Central Station. She continued when Anastasia asked, "Coming by tomorrow? I can show you our areas here and get you equipment for the next time. Ask anyone near the station. They can tell you how to find me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I plan to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was wondering about something you said earlier. You may not even remember it, but you said something about showing you a good time. What did you mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had a good time." Anastasia just stared at her in disbelief. "Seriously. The danger has a purity I have rarely experienced. I know it sounds crazy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, it does. There is nothing fun about that kind of terror."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you do this then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"These people are my friends. I want to keep them safe and I'm good at making that happen. If someone else could do it better, I'd step down in a heartbeat." Once more the tiredness was plainly visible in Anastasia's eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have a good team there. Surely one of them..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"None of them could lead. Alisha is too rigid. No one else would even be willing to try. No, I need to keep the team going and hope a new truce comes soon. Are you going to keep dancing all night? You really should rest."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, but I can't stop quite yet. I'll leave when I can. Shouldn't be much longer." Anastasia almost missed the muttered, "I hope," at the end of Kali's reply.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Long after Anastasia had gone Kali finally stumbled off the train. Danny saw her as he was coming out of the station offices. "You need a hand getting home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stumbled again as she was about to say no. Instead she nodded her head slowly. They walked in silence with Danny catching her when she would stumble or fade. "May I come in?" Danny asked when they reached her door. "I'd like to check your bandages one more time." Kali stood for a moment, then nodded again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside she stripped off Anastasia's clothes, dropping them in a pile at the door to the sitting room, and let Danny check her over. "Looking really good, considering. You should eat something though. You lost a lot of blood."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She made a face and shook her head violently. "Only if you want me to puke all over you. You can sleep in the pillows if you like. I'm hoping for thirty minutes sleep instead of twenty." She managed a ghost of a smile as she pulled herself up the stairs to her bedroom. She was so tired she didn't even feel his eyes track her all the way up the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny gave his head a shake, muttered, "Out of your league Danny-boy," and walked over to the mound of pillows. He pulled and poked them into a comfortable arrangement and flopped down. He was asleep in moments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Upstairs Kali fell back onto her bed and stared up at the canopy. Random images of the day chased around and around. She rolled toward the edge of the bed, planning to get up and go talk to Dementia. Instead her eyes sank closed and she tumbled into sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Two hours later Kali jerked upright in bed. Fire chased along her nerves once more. Groaning in frustration she levered herself out of bed and carefully dragged on a flight suit. It was the only thing she could think of that was loose enough not to rub her wounds. She reached for her boots, then picked them up rather than pull them on. Slowly she eased her weight onto her feet. Like on the train, they hurt for the first few minutes, but rapidly toughened up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Downstairs she paused long enough to check on Danny. He was curled up in a nest of pillows. His face relaxed into boyish cuteness. For a moment he looked like a delicious treat wrapped up and waiting to be sampled. Kali shook her head in a sharp shake. Boys and cute. That was an entirely new idea. One she wasn't sure she wanted to consider very deeply.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She padded down the entry stairs on bare feet. At the bottom she sank onto the steps long enough to pull on socks and boots. Outside she quickly made her way to the Cathouse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two hours after Kali launched herself onto the dance floor she made her way back up to the main floor. At the bar she waved Dementia over, "A Morphine Drip please." When Dementia returned with the drink she added, "Do you have a few minutes later?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In half an hour or so, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I kind of need your help with some more questions," Kali started out apologetically.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"More questions, why am I not surprised? But don't you want to talk to Ennui instead?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"These are about seeing things."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh. How about I come and get you when I'm ready for a break? Will you be here or downstairs?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Downstairs. I'll watch for you. Thank you!" Kali took the last of her drink and returned to the dance floor. She left the empty tube at the bar and returned to dancing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Forty minutes later she spotted Dementia as she came down the stairs. She slipped over to intercept her and together they made their way around the bar. Dementia led the way up to her flat and settled into a chair. She took in Kali's pallor and the dark circles under her eyes. "Are you seeing things that are keeping you awake?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, that would be the adaptation reaction. I still can't stay still for very long. I think the two hours of sleep I got right after the extraction mission was the most I've gotten in the last two days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then what are you seeing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I went on an extraction earlier."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I heard several people talking about it. Something about an almost naked warrior woman taking on the opposition single handed," Dementia laughed at Kali's deep blush. "I'm sorry."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No you're not! Besides, their claws are sharp. They wrecked my clothes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"True, I'm not sorry. But for all your talk of shadows, you don't manage to stay in them very well, do you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled ruefully, "No, not any more. Anyway, I was drowsing, from lack of sleep, when we headed out. Next thing I was seeing the extraction site, complete with little figures moving through it. And if that wasn't strange enough I also saw where the opposition was going to strike from. How is that even possible?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know how it works. It just does. It started for me when I hit puberty. Is this the first time for you, or did you see things in the Realms as well?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This extraction was the first time," Kali paused. "Maybe not..." she continued slowly. Incidents returned to her, most were just vague feelings, but in each case the feelings had been true. "There was once I remember, I was in college and driving with a partner. Something told me not to go at a turn. I ignored it and another car blew through a stop sign and smashed into me. There were others, just not as definite as that. And a few where it felt like something might have happened if things had changed even a slight bit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have an understanding of it then. That's the way it works for me. Once I arrived here it all started to intensify. Now I see entire sequences, whole events. I can walk onto a rescue world and see the events that led up to the destruction. Unfortunately in full surround sight, sound, and smell." Dementia shuddered at the memories.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't that complete for me. I just saw personnel placements and arrival points. Then I saw the target of the opposition's efforts for that world. It wasn't until I actually found the target location that I saw what was desired."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You caused quite a stir in Anastasia's group from what I heard tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I guess. I couldn't just ignore what I saw. I had to be sure it wasn't real and when it was... How often do you see things that don't happen? How reliable is this likely to be for me, assuming it even happens again? In the Realms about half the time the impressions never happened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In the Realms mine were sporadic. Like yours, some would happen and some wouldn't. Here I have been right every time. They change if the sequence of events is modified, but, left without interference, they will play out as I see them, always."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey Kali," Ennui called from the door. "I thought you'd be sleeping after the mission. I hear you've been busy again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No shadows for me anymore," Kali responded bitterly. "Who's been talking? I thought everyone else would be resting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Natalya came in for a little while earlier. She was talking about a weapons cache and how you knew right where to go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's seeing things," Dementia commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is she passing out, getting headaches, or other side effects?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not that she's said. It sounds more like movements and placements rather than full on visions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, she hasn't noticed side effects yet, thank you," Kali replied. "And she's still in the room."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, right," Dementia grinned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will be leaving soon though. I'm needing to dance again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is it the rage stuff you mentioned last time?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think so. The last few days I keep getting too much energy. If I don't dance it off it keeps building until I want to claw myself apart."</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali staggered into her flat at 0400. She slipped off her boots inside her entry door and padded up into her flat. In the bathroom she stared at her reflection for a long time. "Stripping down in front of a guy. What were you thinking? And finding guys cute? When did that  start?" she asked the silent reflection. No answer came back. "Talking to myself in the mirror again. How special is that? Haven't done that since the Realms."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny was still asleep in the pillows when Kali took a quick look. Back in her bedroom she changed into a large T-shirt and fell into bed. Sleep claimed her rapidly for a change.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Sunlight woke Kali two hours later. Everything hurt when she moved. She stifled a moan as she eased out of bed. As she moved the pain slowly decreased to dull, throbbing aches. Downstairs she heard the shower start. She pulled on a thong under her T-shirt and slowly padded down to start coffee. Early morning sunlight filtered into the kitchen and bounced off the hanging pots, throwing sparks of gold everywhere. The ivy shown vivid green in the warm light. Kali stood for a moment and admired the painting like quality of the room before fixing the coffee.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The maker was just finishing when Danny walked in. He was still toweling his hair and making sniffing noises as he followed the fresh scent of coffee. "Ah, a goddess stands before me. She offers up the water of life at this unholy hour of dawn. Yet her feet must be of clay for she neglected to close the drapes and thus deprived me of long morning slumber."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cute Danny, real cute," Kali tried to sound mad but she couldn't stop the snicker.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Might I repay you by preparing an offertory repast?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You may." Danny bustled around the kitchen, assembling various items into a large omelet and seasoned potatoes. He brushed off Kali's offers to help. "Go, sit, if you can. I still want you off your feet." Obediently she perched on a stool and watched.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ten minutes later he placed a small serving in front of her and motioned for her to taste it. "Excellent. Your offering is accepted as a fair trade for the water of life." Kali dished up two large plate fulls and fell upon hers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And what are your plans for the day?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Temple Heath after this. Anastasia and I have an appointment at noon. Probably dancing at the Devil's Cathouse tonight. And yours?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Check your wounds one last time, since I'm here and can. Then restock the med kit on the extraction train and hope for no calls." Danny started water in the sink and reached for the dish soap.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can leave those. I'll do them later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to do them now. I wouldn't feel right leaving you with them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You cooked, that means you shouldn't have to clean up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad you feel that way. If this happens again I'll keep it in mind for then," Danny replied as he washed and dried. "You are on the injured list and I want you to stay there while I finish these." He worked on in silence while Kali dutifully remained perched on her stool. "There, now, if I could see your injuries, feet first?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali lifted her feet and presented them to Danny. He looked, then moved closer. Gently he poked at the balls of her right foot. "Does that hurt at all?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not really. Why? Is something wrong?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure yet." He turned her foot to get more light on it and pushed against her heel. "How about that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It tickles a little and feels a bit like you're pushing through heavy cloth."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've seen some people here adapt in somewhat interesting ways. Looks like you might be one. Take a look at your feet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali pulled her foot up until she could see the underside. Thick darkish pads covered the balls, toe tips, and heel of her foot, making it look like a cross between a human foot and a cat paw. When she poked at the pads it felt cushioned and spongy. "Okay..." She said slowly. "Is this dangerous? Will it spread? I'm not going to morph into a cat or anything, am I? I was getting used to looking like I am now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, you shouldn't. You might need new footwear though," Danny grinned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stepped down on her feet and did a couple of quick turns and jumps. "Wow, this will make dancing so much easier." She leapt into the air and landed on the balls of her feet. She felt very little jarring in her knees, feet, and ankles. "This is wicked fucking awesome!" She spun in place without any of the sticky, grabbing feel of human skin on floor. "Oh yeah!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Before you get too carried away, I'd like to see the others as well." Kali pulled her shirt off. Danny gave the wounds a quick look and said, "These are looking quite good." Kali slipped her shirt back on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How does healing work here? In the Realms I healed very slowly and scarred easily. I think my skin didn't like me much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's not all that uncommon of a problem. Here it just depends on the mind of the person. Some heal very rapidly, sometimes within days. Others take a more Realms style length of time. I've heard it's a bit different for the Shadow Walkers, but I don't know for certain about that. You seem to be one of the fast healing people from what I'm seeing with these injuries."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And the scarring?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Time will tell, but right now it looks like you won't have that any more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something perverse in Kali's mind remembered his blush as she stripped off her shirt. "So, did you like what you saw?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny turned bright red, thinking of how part of his motive was to get her shirt off again, "I may be a medic but I'm not dead. Ok, I am dead but I'm not dead dead. A beautiful woman still registers." He looked away from her and mumbled, "I'd make a play for you, it's just I think it would be rude right now. But when you're healthy and adaptation reaction is over, I'll be interested until you tell me to stop."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She bit back the half hysteric reply that tried to force its way out. Instead she smiled a tight smile and tried to breath out the tension locking her muscles. "I need to get moving. The energy is building again." She dashed upstairs and hurriedly dressed. "Off to Temple Heath. You can hang around here for a while if you like."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I think I'll finish cleaning up breakfast, then head out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outside the morning air felt cool against her flushed skin. She breathed in large breaths to try and still the pounding of her heart. She was calmer by the time she reached Temple Heath. Although she did take ten minutes to run through a few sequences in the yards before venturing to the door and stepping in. She had started toward Bart's office when he waved to her from near Shergar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And the legend of Kali continues to grow," he greeted as she walked up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not my fault, boss."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And whose would it be then? Lauren came in and was talking to Claire and Erick last night. Seems she needed to decompress before heading home after the mission. Our shadow walking woman doesn't seem to stay in the shadows much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh gods, not Erick. Shit!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, well, he might not be so much of a problem. Lauren did mention you taking Danny home with you. That cooled Erick right down. Then Mark came in looking for Lauren and mentioned her efforts. Erick might be off on another target now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Danny helped me home. That's all. He slept downstairs. Nothing Happened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Whoa, whoa, I'm not your parents. It wouldn't matter if something had happened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I don't want anything to happen yet. Do you have something you want me to work on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart stared at her for a moment, then replied, "I'd like you to check out another servo system. She's an EMD SD70M series and she's waiting outside. We don't have room for her inside right now. Let me know if you need a bay with a pit. I'm hoping it's something cab side. Remember, I'm here if you want to talk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know that. Seems like all I do is talk though. I'm not sure if it's helping much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It might take some time before you notice the benefit. Now are you going to stand here talking all day or are you going to get to work?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Work, yes indeed, right you are." Kali headed to the drawing storage for the necessary drawings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire looked up as she entered. "Welcome back. Sounds like you had an intense time of it yesterday. You doing ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your medic check you out this morning?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't like that. He just saw me home and crashed on the pillows in the sitting room." Claire seemed to loosen up slightly with the news. "I'm healing well and fairly quickly. Which is good, the slashes on my back and stomach were really painful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fighting naked runs that risk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was not fighting naked. How did that get started?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lauren. You should have seen Erick drool though." Claire laughed. "I thought he was going to lose it right there. Until he heard about your medic. Then he almost choked on his chips. It sounded like you got messed up pretty badly though. You sure you should be here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm ok. I can't really stay still anyway, so might as well do something while I'm restless. Speaking of, could you help me find another set of drawings? For an EMD SD70M."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, all the newer stuff is over in this corner." Claire led the way to the back left section of the room and pulled open a drawer. "In here. The other newer ones are in the rest of these drawers. So, you going to the Cathouse tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Planning to, yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cool."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know of any dance wear shops in town?" Kali grinned and added, "Fighting naked gets mighty chilly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire laughed in return. "There's one not far from the gothic shop we were in the other day. It's where I got my workout gear for dance classes. They have a wide selection."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks, catch you later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Drawings in hand, Kali headed out into the yard. She started to settle onto the floor to slip in to look at the circuitry. Pressure on her back and sides sent shards of pain radiating from her wounds. She stood back up. Sitting in the control chair wasn't quite as bad as long as she didn't lean back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A quick check of the systems indicated she would have to pull components out. She stood slowly and walked back into the shed. She found Bart in his office. "I'm going to have to wait on the locomotive. I'm a bit too sore to get at all the places I need to check. Sorry about that. If you need it quickly, someone else will need to take a look at it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It can wait. You don't need to apologize for getting injured on an extraction. You know you don't have to be here after yesterday. Will you need a bay when you are able to work on it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I don't think so. And I know I don't have to be here. I just can't stay still and I was hoping I could do something useful with the excess energy. Guess I can't though." Kali paced around his office. A drawing of a boiler section caught her eye. "Although... Do we have any scrap sheet metal? Say eighth inch thick?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure we do. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If I bent it right I could use it to protect my arms and shins the next time out. Who's the best at metal work?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tim, but if you really want precision work, there are a couple of absolute geniuses at Eternal Metal Works. Their shop is in Goth City, just up the line toward Portal Station. Ron Oestrander is the boss man. Or you and Tim can try and bend it up here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything going up there later? Maybe I'll do that today instead."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Check at Central Station, but there's almost always traffic between here and there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks boss." Kali spent the rest of the morning reviewing the servo systems for the locomotive. She could manage to concentrate as long as she sat forward on a chair, well away from the backrest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She left a few minutes before noon and arrived at Central Station a few minutes later. A platform agent directed her across platform ten and into a section of large storage areas that had been divided up with temporary walls. Following the largest of the narrow hallways she emerged into an office. Lauren sat behind the only desk going over maps and diagrams. As Kali approached she could see they were the ones from the last mission. "Oh hi Kali. Anastasia is expecting you. I'm just trying to record what happened yesterday for the Hall of Records. They've been trying to keep a history of Eternia going. Through the door to your left, down the hall to the second door on the right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked at her hands and kind of waved them a little. "That would be this way," she motioned with her left hand, "and then this way?" she motioned with her right hand. "Sorry, I'm right-left dyslexic."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali followed the instructions to another office down the hall. This one was smaller and more crowded than the last. A tiny desk, two chairs, and a book case were wedged into the small room. Scattered everywhere were stacks of plans, maps, and pencil sketches of various places and buildings. Here and there clothing designs in pencil, water colors, and inks were layered over the top. Two torchier lamps struggled to push back the gloom of the enclosed space.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia squeezed around the end of the desk, grabbed the piles off the guest chair, motioned to Kali to sit,  then perched on the edge of her desk. One of the images that flew by looked like one of the tops she had bought when shopping with Claire. "I've seen that before..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I design for the goth shop on Elm Hill."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked! I found some way cool things there the other day."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad. I enjoy designing. So, here we are. I have this prepared thing I tell the new comers, but it covers what you already saw. I could tell you to follow instruction better, but that seems like a bad idea after yesterday. I do want to say thank you for sticking to your certainties. I recommend you stay clear of Alisha for a while though. It will take her a while to forgive you, especially since you were right. Do you have any questions now that you've had some time to think over what happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not that come to mind. I can't promise I wont go off on my own again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, because I don't want that promise. Although your fighting style seems rather risky. The entire dive into the thick of them and lay about works as long as they don't have ranged weapons."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is a rather good point. Although, if you close fast enough the others in their ranks provide cover."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"True enough. What happens if they bring magic into it? We have started to as you likely noticed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then I'm screwed? Most likely we will field a mix like they will. We might try and get Ennui involved. She's a kick ass battlemage. With her backing me up I wouldn't be terribly worried. How is Lauren? She seemed capable, but I was rather busy at the time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lauren can hold her own. She might not be as powerful as Ennui though." Anastasia rose. "Now, let's get you settled in." She led the way farther down the hall to a door on the left. She flipped on a switch and harsh florescent light burst from a wall mounted fixture to light up the cubby of a room. Inside was a tiny desk, chair, and shelf. The walls were of bare plywood and the ceiling was open to the dark vault of the station ceiling high overhead. "All of us get one of these offices, but mostly they get used as a dumping place to keep things in easy grabbing range. You can use it or not at your pleasure. If you want to fancy it up, that's fine too. Your assigned compartment on the train is the same way. In mine I try and keep a spare set of clothes and maybe a weapon or two. Other than that, there is a cache of useful items in the storage area of the common car that everyone can use."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, I forgot to grab your clothes this morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok. Bring them next time you come down." Anastasia guided Kali back through the maze of small rooms, pointing out various ones and listing off whose it was. "You already know most of the train layout. There is a baggage and equipment car at the rear of the train. That's where the weapons and equipment gets stored. Otherwise, it's mostly what you saw yesterday."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked, I think I've got it. I have an unrelated question though. I would like to get to Goth City. Whom do I see in the station for scheduling?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could ask anyone on the platforms, or talk to Fred. I think she's usually at the information counter. She has a monitor showing her what Central Dispatch is seeing for local traffic. Are you doing ok? You took a lot of punishment yesterday."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Surprisingly well actually. Danny checked me out..." she stopped and blushed before amending, "Danny looked over the injuries and they are healing very rapidly and well. As for the bruises and the like, not nearly as painful as I feared."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ahh... So anything you'd like to tell me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Gods, what is it with everyone. I'm not interested in Danny that way. I know I could be and it wouldn't be a problem. I'm not ready to go there yet, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, ok," Anastasia replied, laughing. "Just one of the common adaptation reactions is the screaming hornies. And one of the most common reactions to a fight like yesterday's is also the screaming hornies."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well, ok.." Kali replied through her bright red face. "I'll be seeing you later." She mumbled as she slipped away. She ran for the nearest women's restroom. Inside she rushed into a stall, snapped the door closed and sank onto the stool. She shook as the emotions of rage, despair, and terror stormed through her. Her skin crawled at the thought of someone touching her. She bit her tongue until it bled to keep from moaning out loud in pain and fear. Tears leaked through her fingers and dropped on her lap as her heart pounded painfully in her chest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Long minutes passed as she shivered in the small cubicle. Slowly the tears stopped and dried on her face. When the shakes had stopped she pulled her head up out of her hands. Her eyes stared out with a glassy distant stare at her surroundings. She waited until she didn't hear any movement in the room before easing the stall door open. Using paper towels wetted in cold water she cooled her face until the worst of the red puffiness had receded. She stalked from the room with her face set in a neutral mask. Moving swiftly she made her way back to her flat where she collapsed on her bed as a second round of shakes hit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She slid down into troubled sleep. She ran through dark alleys and narrow caverns, always with hands pulling and grabbing at her. A pushed up section of bricks tripper her, sending her scrambling forward on her hands and knees until dark shapes tackled her and pinned her down. Claws tore and pried at her until her screams yanked her out of sleep. She twisted about in blankets pulled too tight, toppled off the bed, and hit the floor. Twisting and screaming she finally thrashed loose of the blankets. Her breath came in shuddering gasps as she huddled with her back against the bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rather than fading the terror built energy continued to increase, driving her to her feet. She ran downstairs to her studio, threw CDs into the player and turned it up full. The tiny and thin sound did nothing to help. After a few minutes she snapped it off and hurried back up to her room. She stripped off her boots and the boiler suit, reached into the closet, grabbed the nearest items and pulled them on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her bare feet slipped silently down the stairs and out into the night. It wasn't until she stepped onto the cold cobbles that she realized she was barefoot. Shrugging it off, she continued to the Cathouse. She danced off the stairs and into motion. The flashes of thong and thigh, through the slits in her skirt, drew many looks until the watchers saw her face. Then they quickly found other places to look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When her timing started to slip, as she approached exhaustion, she slipped around behind the bar and ran for the loading platform out back. There she continued to move until she fell. Immediately she sprang back up and continued. Soon she was falling and dragging herself back up. Her fingers tore and bled on the rough brick of the building. Splinters from the wooden decking left tears in her palms. In the far distance the pain almost registered, but it wasn't enough to stop her. Finally she fell and couldn't get back up. Her hands continued to twitch and jerk, trying to force herself up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali floated in a disconnected haze for an unknown time until Ennui's voice started to pull her back. "Kali? Kali, can you hear me? Delirium, run and get Dementia!" A faint warmth registered on her skin where Ennui touched her shoulder.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is it? Gods, what happened?" Dementia slid to a halt near Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I came out and found her here. She'd been dancing inside earlier."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's get her up to our rooms." Gently Ennui and Dementia pulled Kali upright. The half carried half walked her up the stairs and settled her on their bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She came in dressed like that? Where are her shoes?" Dementia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. She came in barefoot."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was there any trouble?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. A couple of the usual rowdies were eying her up, but no one did anything to her while she was dancing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not for them," Kali said in a flat, distant, and emotionless voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's not for them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not their choice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What choice is that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I choose who touches me. No one else has that right." Kali's voice was a little stronger, although it still came from a great distance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course it's your choice! What gave you any different idea?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Must keep moving. Help me up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, you're exhausted. You need to sleep, let your body heal." Dementia reached out and gently touched her shoulder. Shattering images poured into her head. Ruined cities, a bloody, burnt, and screaming child huddled in rubble, dark shapes gliding in the shadows. Her head slammed back into the wall with a crack and her mouth pulled open in a silent scream. Loss, pain, and despair washed over her in waves, followed by a raging stream of chaotic energy, demanding movement. It crawled along her nerves burning itching traceries across her skin. Instinctively Ennui reached for her, stopping when Dementia threw her head back and forth wildly. "Knock down tea, full strength, for Kali, please." Her eyes glazed over as the terrors chasing Kali became hers as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the kitchen Ennui's hands shook as she struggled to prepare the tea. Once the herbs had steeped she dropped ice into it to cool it and, moving as rapidly as she dared, she carried a full cup back to the bed. "Kali, this will help. Please drink it." Kali didn't respond. "Kali," Ennui reached out and touched her hair. Slowly Kali's eyes focused on her. The images released Dementia, slipping away in a receding tide. "Kali, you need to drink this. It will help. I'm going to help you up." Ennui slipped her arm under Kali and helped her to sit up. Dementia placed a shaky hand in the middle of her back to help keep her upright while Ennui held the cup.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It will relax you, stop the images for a while," Dementia whispered softly. Kali's empty eyes swung to her. "It happens to me too. This will help you rest without dreams and visions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The tea slid down her throat easily with none of the bitter, nasty flavor of the realms medicines. With it came a heavy black warmth. As she faded into darkness she heard a voice in the distance, "Rest now daughter."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui eased Kali back down and met Dementia's haunted eyes over her. "What happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia eased down and wrapped Kali in a tight embrace. "I touched her and everything in her mind crashed into me. I fear for her, Ennui. She is so very troubled. Slide in on the other side of her. She shouldn't be alone." Ennui grabbed a spare blanket from the closet, placed it over the two on the bed, then slid in on the other side of Kali. Dementia reached over and pulled Ennui close to Kali, then reached across to touch her.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali woke with the early morning light. Warmth pressed in from two sides. For a moment claustrophobia threatened, then she opened her eyes to see Ennui and Dementia snuggled up against her. A desperate need to pee forced her to move. Two sets of sleepy eyes opened as she tried to slip away. She smiled and slid toward the end of the bed. "Got to pee. I'll be right back." When she returned she started to sit down on the end of the bed until Dementia grabbed her and hauled her back into the middle of them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How are you feeling?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just ok?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, actually much better than ok. Thank you both. I'm sorry for being such a pain in the ass."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stop, right there. You were not a pain. Don't go adding this to the firestorms in your head." Dementia said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What? What did you see?" Kali paled suddenly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The wreckage, the screaming girl, and the ash. Don't add this to it. There is no shame in needing help." Dementia replied</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything else? Did you see anything else?" panic tinged the edges of Kali's voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia pulled Kali down and gently turned her head until she could look in her haunted eyes. "You don't need to fear me. I will not hurt you. That is all I saw."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should go," Kali struggled to sit up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia held her back, "No, you should stay here with friends."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are things in my past..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You need not tell anything of your time before Eternia. If you wish to, you may, but none expect it. Here you are known by who you are and what you do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I feel like I've lost so much, and I don't even know when it happened. One day I looked inside and all I saw was the barren waste. What was I? What happened to me? What was I supposed to be?" Kali drew a shuddering breath and continued, "Most of my life I've felt weird and out of place, and while things here feel so much better, I can't seem to shake the baggage. I survived by staying distant, building masks and shells, and letting no one underneath. Strangers you can shield yourself against. But friends, family, and lovers, they slide in under the radar and carpet bomb your psyche. And now I'm here and the masks are slipping and the old terrors are clawing free. Goddess, I just don't know what to do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, it's ok," Dementia said softly, stroking her hair.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How, how is it ok? I want to explore what this means but all the old shit boils up," She pushed herself toward the edge of the bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not this time. You might hate us when this is over, but you are staying and talking about this." Dementia grabbed her in a tight hug.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you dance?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you dance?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I told you, because I can't stop."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you dance if you didn't have to?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And why not?" Kali stared at Ennui. "Why not?" Ennui asked again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't want to." Kali dropped her eyes away from Ennui.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why not?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Leave it alone!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Why wouldn't you dance if you didn't have to?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alright! Because I'm ugly and clumsy and move like I have a board up my ass..." Kali yelled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is wrong with you?! Have you looked in a mirror lately? Have you heard what anyone says about your dancing? Are you deaf or just fucking stupid?" Kali's head shot up, eyes cold and hard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui..." Dementia started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, she's being stupid and she needs to hear this. I don't know who filled her head with crap, but it is not true. Do you hear me, Kali? It Is Not True. I don't know who wanted to destroy you, but do you want them to succeed?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why not? Why not let them succeed? Stupid, selfish, prideful, why shouldn't something like me just end?" Kali snarled back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Goddess, is that how you see yourself?" Dementia held her tighter. "That isn't you!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't know anything about me," Kali spat. "I am all those things and more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bullshit!" Ennui shouted back. She shoved her face right up to Kali's and snarled, "You know less about yourself than your friends. We see you every day. What you do, how, and when. Don't you dare wallow in self despair around me. You want an ass-kicking, fine! Mama y Mama, any time, any where. I'll make you understand if it's the last thing I do!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fuck you! Right here, right now." Kali hissed back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui, Kali..." Dementia started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two sets of burning eyes swung to regard her and two voices screamed, "What!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fine, just fine," she muttered, backing away slowly. They sprang from the bed and circled each other like two stalking cats. Just before they pounced Dementia leapt between them. "Gods damn it all! Stop acting like men."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">""Men?" two voices screeched.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, men, beating your chests and getting ready to pound on each other. Stop this before you both get hurt. Kali, you don't have the truth of yourself. No one does, not without all sorts of mystic mumbo jumbo, and even that rarely works." She slowly walked toward Kali, hands open and spread. Kali stood still, shaking and panting, but some of the rage had bled out of her eyes. Gently Dementia cupped her face, "You deserve so much more than you believe. If you can't think well of yourself, let us do it for you and listen to what your friends say. It is more objective than what you cook up inside your head. Religions have it wrong when they say what's in your heart is most important. What you do in the world defines you and matters the most. You have done many good things here and you need to accept that it makes you good as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali backed away, her head shaking from side to side violently. "No, no, can't be good. Don't want to be good. Good means responsibility, expectations, being judged, playing by someone else's rules. Fuck that!" She continued backing away until she hit the wall. There she stayed, hands raised claw-like in front of her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, it's not that way here. You belong. No one will take that from you. No one will judge you unworthy of it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I just want to belong. Why can't I ever feel like I belong?" Kali wailed as she slid down the wall, curled in on herself, and shuddered with long wracking sobs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui slid down beside Kali and wrapped her arms around her. "You belong here in Eternia." Dementia sat down on the other side of Kali and added her arms to the tangle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I just feel so empty and scared. I had dreams once. Insane, crazy dreams, impossible dreams, but they kept me alive and...operational...through my teens and early adulthood. One day I "woke up" and realized they could never happen. Ever since then I've just been empty, staggering through life because I was either too stubborn or too scared to die. I don't even know which, probably scared, that seems to be me, scared of everything and everyone. Once I leave here I'll freak because you know too much about me now. You've seen it, the shattered wastes," Kali stared at Dementia through distant eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let this place give you a dream back. This would be 'impossible' from a Realms perspective, wouldn't it," Dementia replied. "Try not to fear your friends. Why would we want to destroy you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why would my parents want to? Yet they were always telling me I was nothing special, that anyone could do what I do, that my ego was too large."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who knows, but they aren't here. You are free of them. And your ego isn't large enough from what I've seen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need to go. Bart'll be waiting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not today. Today you stay here with your friends and we show you we aren't going to hurt you. Ennui will have someone tell Bart the last rescue caught up with you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a few more minutes Kali was able to sit there, then her hands started to rub at her arms and head. Soon she pushed herself up and began to pace jerkily around the room. "It begins again," she moaned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can use the dance floor if you want. Turn on the amps on the lighting platform, shove some CDs into the changer and bring up the first fader on the sound board. That should get music for you. Are you going to want food?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks. Maybe food later, but not now." She practically ran from the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Go with her, see if you can stop her before she collapses again. I'll bring you some food and coffee soon," Dementia told Ennui. Kali was already in motion when Ennui arrived. She stood quietly in the shadows observing. Slowly a devious plan formed in her mind. She was grinning to herself when Dementia slipped in behind her and wrapped her arms around her. "Hey love, your coffee and food are on the bar. How's she doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui turned so she could speak into Dementia's ear over the pounding music, "Showing no signs of slowing down. I have something I'd like to try later." Dementia quirked her eyebrows. "If you could get her out of here just before band practice today, then arrange to bring her back when we are practicing. I want to see how she reacts to our stuff."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's not all, is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, but I want to see what happens before I say any more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, I'll try."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several hours later Kali slowed to a stop and approached Dementia on shaky legs. By the time she reached the bar a large glass of water was waiting. Kali smiled and asked, "Might I raid the kitchen for food?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could, or we could go grab some elsewhere."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I did want to go back to the goth shop and the dance wear shop on Elm Hill anyway. Is Ennui going to join us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She has a few things she needs to do here." Dementia replied as she led the way out of the club. The sky was dark and heavy with a damp grey fog woven between the buildings. "How are you doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want me to say? Everything has changed and I still don't know how to cope? My head is still full of shit and I don't know if it will ever get better? Why should I burden those around me with my trivial issues? I've already been hijacking your time, Ennui's time, and Bart's time. At this rate I'll be stopping people in the streets next."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui's right, you need to see yourself for what you really are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then tell me something you like about yourself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tell me something you like about yourself. It's a simple enough request."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali walked in silence for many steps before answering, "I'm not fat anymore."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And what else do you like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is ridiculous!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it's not. You see your flaws in sharp, over-examined detail, but you don't have a clue about your good points. While you are thrashing around in your head you might consider that you dance better than most professionals and you don't have the ego problems they do. You are brave and strong enough to fight for your friends and you have the courage to talk to people about yourself, something many can't do at all. You care about the people around you, even though you don't want to believe it." She grabbed Kali's arm as Kali turned. "Not this time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you think you can really stop me?" Kali asked in an icy tone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Only if part of you wants to stop running." Dementia said, staring straight back into Kali's stormy eyes. "What happened to you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know! I've asked myself over and over and I can't remember anything so awful as to explain my terror of being touched. I don't remember being raped, beaten mercilessly, or seriously messed with like some of my friends. Yet my first reaction to any contact is threat assessment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And why is that wrong? Things can be dangerous."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to understand how some people can smile at strangers, can say hello without their insides twisting. How can they be friendly knowing how anybody can be a hostile?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They believe the world isn't always hostile. It's not always easy, but it can be done. You could do it too if you really want to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali slowed as they entered Elm Hill. "Look, could we grab coffee and find a quiet place for a few minutes before I go shopping?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, but I thought you were hungry too?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was, but I'm not any more. Maybe later."</p>
