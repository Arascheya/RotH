<p class="regtxt5">/* there should be several extractions where Kali is not in charge, but distinguishes herself */</p>

</br>

<a NAME="closing"></a>
<p class="regtxt5">/* extraction where Ennui takes control of the magic and Kali takes control of the tactics - Anastasia was supposed to be in charge - will need to update Adventures with this new data as well - currently this is the old ver from Adventures - Kali will tell Ennui to think Balance instead of Destruction as she stabilizes the magic Anastasia, Lauren, and Alisha began */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stalked to the train, tension eating at her. She pasted on the most calm look she could manage as she boarded and hurried to a seat in the back of the passenger coach. Once the train had passed through the Portal she gathered her usual team of Danny, Lauren, Lissa and Alisha. She quickly briefed them on their real mission. "Ennui will be joining us on this mission. Before you protest Head Dispatch assigned her specially for this mission. I want you to keep her from getting hurt."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia gathered Ennui once the main team had spread out to begin the recoveries. She outlined the mission and specifically instructed Ennui to be careful. Then she headed up the ridge toward the location of the demon forces. As the team reached the top of the ridge Anastasia motioned for them to get down and move forward slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the team reached the drop into the adjacent valley they saw a cluster of buildings around a stone circle. As they watched, grey skinned beings emerged from several of the building and poured a large tub of fluid into the center of the circle. More figures emerged and formed a ring around the stones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later a larger being emerged from another building and crossed to the ring of beings. It strode into the center and began an intricate, hypnotic ritual. Anastasia motioned everyone back. She was ignored by the entire team. It wasn't until she turned each person's head away that she was able to break the trance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once everyone was assembled out of sight of the valley Anastasia whispered instructions. "We need to stop them from opening that gate. At least until the rest of the mission is completed. Lauren, Alisha and I have some magic that we can use to blast the stones and topple them. The rest of you need to keep watch to make certain we aren't disturbed. Ennui, you watch the valley for movement our way. Lissa, take the south section of the ridge. Danny, you take the north, and Kali, you keep watch back toward the main group."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the sentries headed off to their posts Anastasia, Lauren, and Alisha began a soft chant. Ennui could feel the energy ebbing and flowing in sluggish ripples, building, then falling back as they struggled to keep the rhythm. The grey beings ritual built into a frenzy as darkness began to coalesce in the center of the stones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui risked a quick glance back to the three spell casters as they continued their struggle. A small white ball was forming near Alisha. She tried to juggle it in a shaking hand. To Ennui the pattern looked ridiculously simple. She could see no reason why it should give them any trouble at all. Finally, in frustration, she called, "Transfer control. Give me the pattern. You are losing it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You haven't been trained. I can't," Alisha replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Transfer control, now! I can stabilize it. Give me the pattern!" A flash of anger flitted across Alisha’s face as she tossed the energy ball toward Ennui. It darted to a place above her head and began to pulse and wobble crazily. Sweat popped out on Ennui's face as she fought to stabilize the badly executed pattern. For a few minutes she tried to maintain it as a destructive blast. In the back of her mind she could feel the dark energies as they built to cataclysmic proportions in the circle below. The answer blossomed in a perfect moment of clarity and she shifted and turned the pattern in her hands until it became the perfect counter-point to the dark spell in the valley.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly the blob popped into a perfect ball of light. Looks of wonder formed on Lauren and Alisha's faces as they shifted toward Ennui. They fed energy into it, seeking to strengthen the destructive spell they had started. The ball swelled and began to fly apart as the balancing spell shredded under the onslaught of too much energy. Her face twisted into a silent shriek as she snarled out, "Too much! I have enough!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Energy crackled and sizzled in her hair. Lightning danced from her fingertips to the ground as she raged and fought to restore the perfect balancer. After long minutes the corona around her dimmed and the ball shrunk back to a dancing globe of white. Ennui looked up at it and smiled. With a gentle little push she nudged it toward the dark energies that were gathered around the stones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Like a ball rolling down a hill the little globe of light started moving slowly, gathering speed as it went. "Get down! The back-blast can kill you!" Alisha yelled. The rest of the team dove for the ground. Ennui stood with her head slightly cocked and a bemused expression as the little ball rolled closer and closer to its target. Mesmerized the rest of the team watched as it gently bumped into the roiling black cloud of energy. There was a firm whump and the black energy vanished. Little grey dust devils danced away from the stones and into the grey beings. Eleven of them dropped soundlessly to the dirt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stood shakily and stared at Ennui, "What have you done?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I balanced the gate with a counter-gate," Ennui replied calmly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali laughed as she came up to the group. "Very impressive, battle-mage."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, warrior woman."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali was about to continue the banter when a tickle of danger flared along her nerves. She dove into Ennui and brought them both to the ground. A black ball of energy sailed through where they had been moments before. "Alisha, the rest of you, get down, now!" Black energy bursts shot through the air. One clipped Lauren as she dropped slower than the others. "Ennui, can..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, get the rest of them out of here and warn the main team. I'll slow them down a bit and follow right behind you." Ennui's hands moved in a blur as she drew energy and channeled it back at the approaching beings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Patterns blossomed in Kali's head while she scrambled toward the others. Wire frame images formed of the terrain around her with red and blue dots scattered about. One of the blue dots moved where she crawled. Three more marked Alisha, Lauren, and Anastasia, and another marked Ennui. The last close dot showed where Danny was making his way toward Lauren. Grey dots appeared, moving toward them on the ridge. Complex movement plans danced through the image as her mind went off on its own and began running various sets of actions. Tiny little figures danced up and down the hillside, first moving one way then the other, always in a jerky kind of fast motion. In each case some or all of the figures on her side dropped and didn't move again. Suddenly one snapped into focus. The little figures danced a simple pattern and then ran for the train.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As soon as Kali reached Alisha she started the plan in motion for real. "Alisha, you move left and around the clump of trees, come up on their flank. Fire into the center of them. There's a leader in there, the third one up from the back and surrounded by the tallest ones. Don't kill it, just knock it out. As soon as the center figures drop, break around the back of them and run for the recovery team." Next she slid over to Danny where he was tending to Lauren, "Can you move her? If so, start back for the recovery team. We'll be right behind you. Warn them they have half an hour to get things wrapped up. Anastasia, could you go with them and provide covering magic if necessary?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stared at Kali for a moment, before nodding in agreement. "Yes, I'll get them out. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cover you. Lissa, can you do magic on your own?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She gave a frightened nod, "What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're with me. We are going around to the right, through the bushes over there, and provide cover while Anastasia gets the other two out," Kali pointed where they would go. "There's a small group coming up just to the right of those bushes. In the back is a spell user. I'll keep you safe, but you need to knock all of them out. We don't want to kill them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lissa stared at Kali with wide eyes, "How do you know that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have to trust that I do right now. Maybe I can explain later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Why not kill them? I know how to do that, I think."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It," the words began to form in Kali's head as she spoke them, "It's a balance issue. If we kill then they can kill as well. If we don't they won't either." Kali wanted to stop and think about this new development but there was no time. Quickly they crawled to the bushes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A very few moments later the predicted group of grey creatures emerged from the trees exactly where Kali had indicated. Lissa turned frightened eyes on her and stammered, "I, I don't know if I can do this. I've never tried to knock them out before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fear chased through Kali's stomach and she wanted to shake her something awful. Instead she reached out and put a hand on her shoulder, "Think back to how you do magic. It had to be terrifying the first time but you did it. You can do it now. I trust you. I can protect you, but if you do this, you will keep more of us alive." Lissa nodded shakily and chanted a few weird sounds almost silently.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stood to the side, watching the advancing line of beings. Lissa cast her first spell before the beings noticed them. The first three dropped soundlessly. Lissa grinned and began readying the next round.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The leader pointed straight at them and began to gesture. His hands were coming up in the final motions when Lissa's spell hit him first. two more dropped, leaving the last two in the line. They stopped uncertainly and stared at Kali. By the time they had decided to advance Lissa had fired her third spell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well done! I knew you could do it. Now we run for the train. I hope Alisha convinced them to get ready."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, I did it!" Lissa laughed almost hysterically. Twenty minutes later they were in sight of the train. It looked like Kali's message had not been taken seriously. The team was still scattered about the site merrily digging and carrying on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What the fuck is this? Weren't you warned? Get on the train right now!" Kali shouted. "Lissa, start warning people you know, get them headed toward the train."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thomas, the official team leader puffed up and bellowed, "Hold it! I am in charge here. I would do nothing to endanger this mission."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then why didn't you listen to Alisha? You know she's an extraction team member."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Her story was preposterous. There has never been any demonic activity on this world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali drew breath to shout just as Lissa spotted a clot of grey figures breaking from the cover of the trees. "Kali, behind you!" She spun and drew energy. Thomas stood rooted to his spot as an energy bolt shattered the ground in front of him. He staggered back stunned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone, fall back to the train." Kali ran at Thomas and shoved him out of the way as another ball shrieked toward him. It clipped her back. Howling in pain she dropped to her knees.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui burst into view behind the grey figures and let fly at them. Several dropped without a sound. Three of the trailing figures turned to rush her but the main force continued toward the train and the workers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lissa drew energy again and fired into the advancing force. Ennui continued to slam magic into them, dropping them two and three at a time. At last the final group slumped to the ground. Ennui dropped to her knees as Anastasia, Lauren, and Danny emerged behind her. Danny helped her up and wrapped an arm around her for support. He hurried her toward the waiting group.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thomas turned scared eyes on Lissa as the battle wound down. "How could I know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alisha got back. You didn't listen to her," Lissa interrupted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talk later," Anastasia interrupted over the top of Lissa. "There are more behind us. Too many for just the few of us to stop. Thomas, make up for it. Help Kali back to the train. The rest of you, round up the stragglers. We have maybe five minutes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali slid into unconciousness as Thomas lowered her onto a set of foldered down chairs. Danny moved over to her and began working her injury.</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, Kali..." Danny called as he bent over Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Want sleep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, come on, I need you to wake up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sleep now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, Kali, I need you awake."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She pried an eye open and looked into the face of Danny. "Prick," she mumbled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. You want to see it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali couldn't stop the giggles that prompted. "Ouch! Now see what you did, you brat?" She had wanted it to be teasing but it came out more like a whine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, now you are waking up. I need to check your shoulder and I didn't want that to be what woke you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali struggled to sit as she asked, "Are we ok? Did we get everyone?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, everyone's ok. You're the worst of the lot."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about Lauren?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lauren took a hit but it isn't as bad as yours. Ennui's sleeping off whatever she did and Thomas is wanting to apologize as soon as you're ready." Danny's fingers were moving as he spoke and a stab of pain followed. Gently he rolled Kali over and examined it. "Looks like you're going to be ok. No sign of infection or poison. Thank you, you did a great thing getting us all out alive." Swiftly he bandaged the wound and settled her back onto the set of seats that had been rigged as a bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ugh, how long have I been out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Four hours. We arrive at Portal station about an hour from now. And Thomas would like to talk to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I suppose I should give him his chance. It'll only get harder if I put it off. Could you help me sit up? I don't want to be laying down for that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No weakness in front of the troops?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali couldn't tell from his voice if he was serious, mocking or teasing so she just said, "Nope. Must appear super-human at all times. Passing out kind of spoils that, though," She finished through a very shallow laugh which still hurt more than she had hoped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're doing ok with it I think." He finished propping Kali up with a big wad of pillows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thomas hesitantly approached, leaking nervousness and worry, "I, uh, I'm sorry about all that. I've never seen that kind of attack before. I didn't mean to put anyone in danger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd say it was ok, but it really isn't. You can't take those kinds of chances with people's lives," Kali replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But how was I to know it wasn't hysteria?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thomas," Kali tried to be as diplomatic as I could. "Alisha is an extraction team memeber. Has no one briefed you about this? The extraction team only gets sent on missions where a dark force attack is likely. Our very presence on the mission should have you concerned. When a member of that team raises the alarm, it needs to be taken seriously. No one on the extraction team is known for hysterics in the face of danger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, I didn't," His eyes turned slightly moist as he tried to explain, "Look, I was in charge because I can coordinate recovery actions pretty well. You're the first person to tell me about an 'extraction team' and who might be on it. I'm not good when it comes to thinking about danger. I'm an archeologist, or at least I was. My skills are knowing what kinds of things are important, from an artifact stand point. I didn't sign on for war."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"None of us did. I fear that we are in one whether we want to be or not. Leading in ideal cases is easy. Leading during danger is not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Next time..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't worry about next time. I suspect there'll be a debriefing, if I know Merris. Things will get worked out and new policies decided afterward."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny walked up while they were finishing. He waited patiently until Thomas had returned to his seat before asking, "You still doing ok? If you start feeling worse, let me know immediately."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes sir, mister doctor sir."</p>
</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He smiled and said, "And don't you forget it missy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia rose when Danny moved away. She crossed to him and asked softly, "How is she?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Amazingly well considering the injury she sustained."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would it be ok for me to talk to her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Should be. If she starts looking distracted or pained come and get me. I'm going to check on Lauren."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How is Lauren?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She'll be ok. Her injury isn't quite as bad as Kali's. She's concious but I want to be sure she's stable."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked up as Anastasia approached, "Hey."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey yourself," Anastasia looked around nervously. "I wanted to talk to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry about that, stepping on your lead like I did."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, that's ok. I'm very glad you did."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not doing very well at this. Every extraction has been harder than the last and people are getting hurt. It won't be long until I get somebody killed. I won't be able to handle that. I'm resigning from this as soon as we get back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, but why are you telling me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want you to think about taking over. You're the best I've seen. You kept your head, even when injured, and you figured out how to get us all back. You don't have to, but there's no one else that can or will lead." Kali stared at her silently while her mind churned over the offer. "You don't have to answer now, in fact maybe it's best if you think carefully first." Anastasia settled back into a nearby chair and tried to still the pounding in her heart. She didn't know what she would do if Kali turned her down. A single tear trickled down her face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The request bounced around in Kali's head. Insecurity on insecurity scrambled into place. Thousands of reasons clawed at her to refuse, to walk away as fast as she could. Terror wrapped icy tendrils in the mix. Words of regret and refusal began to assemble themselves in her mind. She turned to tell Anastasia when she caught sight of the tear as it tracked down her face. Her mind blanked. Suspended between thoughts she stared at the slowly crawling drop of water. Reflected in it she saw death, terror, and so much sorrow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Without thought she wrapped Anastasia in a close hug. The flood gates opened and tears poured from her eyes. Anastasia trembled as she fought to not give sound to the sobs wracking her body. Kali held her, a silent and empty rock caught in the storm. "Daughter, please consider what she asks. You have the strength where she does not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ma, Kali," Kali's mind shrieked. "Why? I don't want to be responsible any more. I don't have that strength."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You do my daughter." Images flashed in Kali's mind. Her first battle and then other extractions where she had always protected those around her. The dark goddess faded into view in Kali's mind. "You carry one of my names. You are Destroyer and Mother. You have always been. Would you deny yourself?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, mom," Kali answered with as much sarcasm as she could manage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Insolent child," the dark vision roared through an enraged face. Kali flinched, then stood her ground. A lifetime of resentment, against religion of any kind, kept her staring back. As she watched the angry face began to shift and move until the dark goddess began to laugh. "Do you have any idea how rare it is for anyone to stand in the face of my rage?" Her image shimmered and shifted until an older version of Kali stood watching her. "Now you truly are a daughter of mine. You are one of few to receive that status."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You made me, mother, when you gave me everything I ever wanted on the first trip into the void. Yet I..." Kali looked away uncomfortably as she started to speak.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know of your hatred of religion. It causes me no concern. Even as you rage against religion and belief you remember me for what I am. It is more pure than many who dedicate their lives to me. Be at peace with yourself." She smiled warmly, "Now I ask that you consider your friend's request. The decision and choice remain yours." The image faded back out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you ok? I didn't mean to embarrass you," Anastasia whispered softly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Huh, oh," Kali replied vaguely as she tried to pull her mind back to her surroundings. "No worries on my side. How about you? Are you going to be alright?" She held Anastasia as her sobs subsided. "It's ok, I won't tell. Crying doesn't make you weak. Even if I agree with you and won't do it in front of others either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia pulled away slightly. Taking the sleeve of her top she scrubbed at her face and eyes. "I know, but I still can't let the others see it." She stood, shook her hair out so it covered most of her face, and hurried to the washroom. She returned a few minutes later looking almost back to normal. "I'll be ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"About your offer, I've given it a bit of thought and I accept. What do we need to do to make it official?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let Central Station and Dispatch know when we get back, then tell the team. They shouldn't be too much trouble, you have proven yourself, especially today," Anastasia stood and continued, "We can talk more once we get back. I'm going to try not to think about any of this for the remaining trip back. Danny said you should try and rest, at least I think that was what he was saying in doctor speak."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll try."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Kali talking to her new team - after the transfer and before the influx of the large crew */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stood nervously in front of the small group. "There is no easy way to say this. I am stepping down from leader of our team. I have been doing this since the begining and I need to take a break. Don't worry, I'm leaving us in good hands and I am not leaving the team. I have asked Kali to step up and she has agreed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stood up and crossed to the front of the group. "I don't know what else to add. I don't see our procedures changing other than the transfer of leadership. This is a dangerous thing we do and we are the best. All of you have taught me so much. We need to keep relying on each other and doing what we do best."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are the only," Mark mummbled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That may be, but we are still here. We are still alive. So, even if we are the only, we are still the best. There are a few things I want to make better. I've told as many rescue mission leaders as I can to find us weapons. We should be looking to do the same every time we go out. The proxy forces won't stay static in what they will use. We can't afford to either. The pressure is continuing to climb. We are being attacked more often and with stronger forces. Ennui has volunteered to pass on as much magical skill as she can. She and Dementia have agreed to come on those missions where Dementia believes things will be very bad. There are a few others we can call on as well. I don't want to over use them. If we burn them out, we all lose," Kali looked down. When she looked up again her eyes were haunted. "I fear some of us will die. There have already been deaths on some of the rescue missions. Remember, we are their best chance. Our purpose is to keep our friends safe."</p>
