<p class="regtxt5">/* once Tracy has moved in Kali will start realizing she isn't a home owner type - she's perfectly happy to turn over maintenance and the rest to Tracy - then for her company car, she starts out thinking she'd use the full car, but decides instead only to claim the dome for her bedroom. the rest remains team areas. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* introduction of larger team */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* replace Ennui with Anastasia */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi led the group across the station to a siding where a motley array of rolling stock sat. On closer inspection it was actually linked up to form a train of sorts. Gaudy circus stock from all times in history sat beside other rolling stock that would have looked at home in a post apocalypse world. Several people were working on various coaches, scrubbing, painting, and repairing signs of recent damage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi turned to one, a thin woman with purple and blonde streaked through black hair, "Ennui..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sammi, Jemima, what's happening?" She asked watching the group of people following the two women.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Got a present for K... for QBC. Is she around?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"QBC is inside, in the conference car. Ummm, the one with the jumping tigers painted around the windows." Ennui added at Sammi's puzzled look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Behind her Sammi heard someone mutter, "QBC? What the...?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She smiled as she turned, "Don't ask. You'll find out soon enough. Wait here a few would you?" She sauntered over to the train and entered. Stepping over the gear in the entryway she made her way to the open section in the center of the car. There she found Kali studying an array of drawings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jemima, heya." Kali smiled in greeting. "What's the what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Remember that new crew you asked for? We found it for you." Sammi laughed as Kali looked out the window in the direction Sammi pointed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"ALL of them? That's an army, not a crew..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well it's kind of a package deal of one hundred fifty-eight survivors. There were a few more at the start. We found them on a world where the Younger Ones were engaged in their usual game of proxy war. Yeah, I know, normally they'd go off in Sacred Units, but they all want to kick some ass instead. The Lady thought you could help them out. Besides, you've got a pretty big train here and I know you can find more rolling stock if you need it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali shook her head violently, "No, no way. I can't be responsible for them." All the while chanting in her head, 'Mother, no, please, no.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Daughter, yes you can, you must. They need this as much as you need.' The dark voice of power rolled in her head.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Mother...' Kali thought in agony. she dropped her head briefly in defeat, "Ok, let me tell my crew and I'll be out. Tell Ennui crew meeting inside, stat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once everyone was around the table Kali began, "Looks like we have the crew we needed." She waved toward the window, "Maybe even more than we needed. Sammi and Jemima just brought them over."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do they know how things work yet?" "How many are there?" Questions flew from around the table until Kali waved them into silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hold up a bit," she smiled to take the sting off. "I don't know the what of it yet. There are one hundred fifty-eight of them. I have no idea what they know of Eternia and Death City. We're going to have to assimilate them into our teams and find out. They all came from the same place. Another place of the Proxy Wars. They want to fight back. We have to teach them about the balance of things before we let them into combat." She stared down at her hands for along while. With a weary sigh she continued, "We'll divide them into teams based on previous experience and get them settled. We know the routine, it's just a bigger crowd this time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You ok boss?" Ennui asked as she watched Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I will be, just not at the moment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can take care of this if you want..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I need to make sure they know who's Queen Bitch in Charge from the start. Once we get them split up you can each take care of your new team. Ah hell, it's not like I haven't done this..." She stood and untied her boiler suit top from around her waist. She shrugged her arms into the sleeves and zipped it up over her crop top. Properly armored up she strode to the carriage door and out into the sunshine. The rest of her crew followed a few paces behind. As she walked they saw her assemble her public mask.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When she reached the crowd she began, "So, I hear there's a few of you who want to kick demon ass out here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah!" "Right on!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good!" She smiled at them. "We are going to break you up into groups and explain what I am about to tell you more completely, but first I want to give you the basic what of Death City. In the guide books, if there were any, it would be listed as, 'Death City. The Ageless. City of Power. East of Heaven and west of Hell, it stands at the center of Eternia, the realm between.'."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A woman shouted from the center of the crowd, "Well that sounds all mystical and shite, but what does it really mean? Where are we and what happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'I thought I could write better than that, how cliche, the token heckler from the crowd to force exposition...' She smiled ruefully at herself and answered, "Death City is a place Between. It is not the land of the living nor is it the land of the dead. The Death City Charter is to recover the beauty of the Realms before it is destroyed by war and disaster. These things of beauty are then placed back into Realms that are in need of them, that will treasure and use them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Our friends died getting us here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know and that happens all too often. That is the usual way of arriving here though. Your friends weren't the only ones to die. They just chose to go to the Havens. It seems the rest of you petitioned for a way to strike back and that is what I can offer you. There are a few rules that we have to follow though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rules, bah. I don't need this shit." A large man scoffed from the back. He might have been handsome except for a large nose that looked like it had been broken and flattened several times in his life. He stood half a head or more over most of the others with wide shoulders, heavily muscled arms and chest, tapering to a naroow waist and solid legs. Warm tingles fluttered in Kali's lower belly as she looked at him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She forced herself to stop staring befor saying, "You're right. You can go whenever you wish. I'm not here to recruit you. I can offer you a chance to strike back, but by all means, go find other arrangements if you can. Anyone else who isn't interested can go with you." There was a smattering of laughter from the crowd. "For those of you who might be interested here's the quick what of it. The charter of Death City, where you are right now, is this: We rescue beauty from the ruins of the Proxy wars. We are not to directly interfere with or attack the combatants of either side. If we are attacked then we can fight back. If Death City draws first blood then our people pay a price in the same level of damage or death as what they caused. That said we are an Extraction Team. We go in and rescue the rescuers when things go wrong. So we often fight since we usually aren't called unless Death City people have already been hurt or killed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And who might you be?" the large man challenged.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're still here? I thought you weren't interested. I'm the Queen Bitch in Charge. Who might you be?" Kali replied, fighting not to lick her lips at the thought of him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali heard several muttered "QBC...no wonder..." comments from the crowd as well as a few more laughs before the large man answered. "I am Petrov."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well then Petrov, are you in or out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to strike back, so I'm in. For now. And what kind of name Queen Bitch anyway? Don't you have a real name?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled enigmatically, "Yes, and those who remain will get to know it. There are a couple more rules for this team that I should mention right now. We don't waste the living on the dead. If one of us dies on a mission we don't try to go back for the body. Also the mission is the critical item. If we are rescuing another team we finish that first. So if some of us get cut off, we are on our own until the primary objective is complete. We won't risk anyone outside our own in a bad situation."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali let the mutterings and comments flay for several minutes before she held up her hand. When the crowd didn't notice right away Ennui gave a piercing whistle, "Listen up people."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali waited while Ennui held fingers to lips to give another whistle if it was needed. Once the crowd had wound down to silence Kali asked, "Now that you know the basic what of it, who is still in? Those of you planning to stay will be split into small groups and assigned a crew chief. They will explain the details and answer your questions." She waited as the group shuffled their feet and watched to see if any would leave. She was surprised when none did. "Ok then, count off by numbers, one through sixteen, then start again. There will be sixteen groups of you."</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">/* Extraction Mission - much later */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stepped off the platform into the dining car (probably something ornate and circus-like - i still see her train as being a mad-max mix of circus cars and oddly assembled bits from everywhere - need to have descriptions of various train bits as they fit). where the team leaders waited. She sat in her chair at the head of the table and stared at the stack of printouts she had brought in for long moments before looking up at the waiting faces. One look at her face told them it was going to be a hard one. Seeing the looks she smiled and said, "Well, let's get to it shall we? We like challenges, remember?" She </p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* new crew issues */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* squad - ten person teams, Platoon (maybe) - 5 ten person squads, company - the full team, about 3 platoons or a6 squads */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked up from her screen and growled, "Arg, Leopardess doesn't have the power to pull the new train. I suppose we could go to diesel-electrics, they are easier to control. It's just they lack that primitive elegance of Leopardess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* add in decision tree about how to solve the issue - build another steam and use computer systems to slave, go with an all diesel solution, go with a hybrid - instrument Leopardess and slave diesel boost units, multiple steam with additional engineers... */</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">/* Petrov */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Petrov - promotion to second */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked up from the stacks of paper spread out on the table in front of her. "Ah, Petrov. Anastasia and I just had a very interesting conversation..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't like that..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Petrov..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You need to hear my..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Petrov!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can't just..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Petrov, Shut UP!" He stopped finally. "Sit down, I have something I want to talk to you about." Petrov settled himself into the chair at the far end of the table and watched Kali. "Anastasia is stepping down as leader of your team. She is quite aware that you were right in your handling of the situation. She wants me to name you the new squad leader."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wha-what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have the respect of the others, you are smarter than you let on, and you keep cool in a crisis. You are quite qualified, I just need a few assurances. First, I expect you to question me as you questioned her. Second, any such questioning will be in private. Third, I won't always defer to your viewpoint. In those cases you will carry out the instructions I issue. If you can abide by those rules you will be my second in command and the leader of your team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Second in command, so soon after joining? Won't this alienate your older team members?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"None of them want it. There are sixteen from before and over one hundred and fifty that came with you. And, so you know, Anastasia is leaving the team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Leaving, completely?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's returning to regular Recovery Missions. Could you let her know you agreed and have her gather the rest of the team leads?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Petrov and Kali talking about team structure */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Permission to speak freely, ma'am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What the fuck was that, Petrov?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm just trying to be the good XO, ma'am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's just fucked up. Don't start yanking my chain with that military crap! And don't call me ma'am, I hate being called ma'am. And what's this XO bullshit, anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A way to yank your chain. And a way to start a discussion about needing a bit more structure now that there are so many of us. You started military like structure when you split us into squads. You have borrowed the other good parts as well, such as reprimand in private, respect those under your command, challenge command descisions when necessary and always in a respectful manner. I think what needs to happen is for you to publicly acknowledge that as the model. It will give us direction and stability in the chaos we are facing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, what have you done with the real Petrov? The real Petrov wouldn't propose any of this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes he would, actually, if he thought it would be a good idea. Where I am from military service was required. I hated it for the most part, but there were a few good things to come from it as well. I learned I could rely on myself and my team. The military looks out for their own. You know what is expected of you and you know you have a place to stay, food to eat, and basic necessities are provided. There are sixteen teams of ten people. The old style of informality won't work if we all have to go out on a really big mission. You can't keep leading from the front. When you were a small team it might have made sense, but not any more. I know you seek death, any with eyes can see it. As our leader, you can no longer be that selfish. We need you to believe in and trust us to take care of ourselves and we need to trust and believe you are doing the same."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I won't send someone out to die. I won't do that, not if I'm not taking the same risks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have to. That's what being the leader is all about."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I never asked to be the fucking leader!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you are and we rely on that. We need you to be making the best possible decisions for us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Petrov  - as second, early in the sequence of large missions*/</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* tighten up - Petrov is blunt and direct */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petrov stood and folded his arms in the doorway. "You should not come this time boss."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Out of my way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know you seek death, any with eyes can see it. As our leader, you can no longer be that selfish. We need you to believe in and trust us to take care of ourselves and we need to trust and believe you are doing the same.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't let you go out there. When you were just a small squad it made sense for you to lead from the front. Now we are a small army and you are the one we choose to follow. If something happens to you out there we are the worse for it. Sure someone else could do as well or better than you." Petrov ignored the ice forming in her eyes and continued, "however you are the one we choose to trust. No one else has that. You need to stay here where we know you are safe and where we know you can keep an eye on us. We need you to believe in and trust us to take care of ourselves and we need to trust and believe you are doing the same. I know you seek death, any with eyes can see, but you need to live for more than just yourself now." He gestured at the head mounted camera and headset, "Besides, all this fancy new shite will keep you in the loop. Your strength is planning and tactics, use them for us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bullshit, my strength is making it up as I go. I can't plan my way out of a bag."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So make it up as we go from here. We need you to be safe. Something feels very wrong here. And you know if I can feel it, it has to be bad."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">kali - voice breaking in anguish - i can't send someone else out to die. i won't do that.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petrov - you have to, that's what being the leader is about. we can't afford to loose you, so you have to let us do and risk for you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* to entire team */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do the others seem to hate us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They don't hate us. It's just that we show up when things are going to be bad. Most of Eternia only sees us when they are or will be in extreme danger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* talking to Ennui later */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Kali is freaked because she has serious hots for Petrov - she is still dealing with parts of her new attraction to boys */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">KALI: This is different. Sometimes I like sex with boys. There's something about that hard, sharp, fast energy that can be an interesting change, but I don't fall for guys. Petrov interests me and it troubles me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* could consolidate this into the discussion after their indiscretion, that's really going to flip her switches because of what she wants after the fact */</p>
