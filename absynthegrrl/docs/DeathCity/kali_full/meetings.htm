<p class="pagecaption">Dreaming in Death City</p>
<p class="pagecaption">part - Meetings</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She saw them stop, stare, then continue toward the table. Suddenly the one in the back grinned and shoved her companion ahead of her. "Kali, well here is a welcome surprise! Oi!" The last bit was directed at Sammi who was still trying to distinguish Kali’s features in the flickering firelight. "Come on love, she’s even got the beers in for us, and after what we've been through I think we could both do with a drink or three." She said as she guided Sammi over to the table and pushed her into the seat opposite Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi seemed to come back to herself as Jemima pushed one of the bottles into her hand. "Don't mind me...I...I mean we, that was a bad one. But," she said as she took a long pull from her beer, "We survived. Come, love", turning to Jemima, kissing her gently on the cheek, "they say a pain shared is a pain halved. Shall we talk about it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima took a long drink of her own, then reminded Kali to do likewise, "Hey, come on, if we two are going to get sozzled and pour our hearts out to you, the least you can do is return the favor. Cheers!" Another long pull drained her bottle and she immediately waved to Jo for another.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali took another deep drought of her Imperial Stout. While she was still savoring it Jo flitted over a tray with three more drinks, expertly sliding them within easy grasp of the three at the table. With a flourish of her black skirt she was off again to check on the other patrons.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima looked at Sammi who was gazing into the fire and said, "She’s had a hard trip. In fact we both have. Just now I think we both need to talk a few things over, at least you should get an interesting tale out of it!" Jemima paused for a long time before she began, "It was a hard mission. We had gone out as a standard recovery to a world where the dark side involvement was higher than normal. We had finished our mission and were headed back when we received word that one of the other teams had been captured. As a result, we ended up becoming an Extraction Team without any warning or preparation." She took a long shaky sip from her beer. "By the time we arrived back the other team had been taken to one of the temples and were being prepared as sacrifices to the Dark Ones. Sometimes...sometimes there is no way to...sometimes the only rescue that can be performed is to send a team member into death to release them from the demonic forces. This was one of those missions. Most of the others were lucky. We found them caged outside the temple, all except Kerith."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima paused again and reached out to lay her hand to Sammi's shoulder. For a long moment they just gazed at each other, a stream of love and affection seeming to flow between them, then Jemima resumed the tale. "Kerith is dead and need never fear suffering again. You were right about those bastards", She nodded at Sammi, "when we smashed through the barrier they had her staked out on the altar, naked, and the vermin were pushing red hot needles into her skin. That wasn't the worst of it, though, that black priest was there, and had her mind in some kind of torment - as we raced down the nave she must have heard the noise of the engine, for she looked towards us with all of Hell in her eyes". Sammi flinched and tears ran unchecked from her eyes, remembering how she’s had to wait at an outlying spot. She had held the counter spell up so the others could get through to the temple.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At least she is beyond their reach now", Sammi fought the words round the cold lump in her throat, "but to think she died like that -"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. No!" Jemima interrupted, finally realizing what had upset Sammi so for the last two days, "Megren gave us a perfect approach, old "Shergar" rolled right up on the altar and cut poor Kerith in half - but while demonic magic ends instantly, life takes a second longer. I was leaning from the leading window, and just for a second, while we thundered forward, she was freed of her pain", Jemima gazed intently into Sammi's eyes as she went on, "Never in my life have I seen such bliss on a human face, I swear she found the havens there in front of my eyes! Her death was a release, not a torment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For long moments it seemed that Sammi didn't hear what Jemima was saying, the relief washed through her and she threw herself into her lover’s arms. "She really died in peace?" Sammi asked, as the pain faded realizing Jemima would never lie to her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She died in peace, with 55055 running down her torturers", Jemima answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What happened next?" Sammi asked, after a long moment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shergar rammed the tabernacle and all of hell erupted around us", Jemima answered, "I was still at the window, and I saw the temple engulfed in magic fire just as I was thrown to the floor. Then something, with the power of death itself, grabbed hold of the train. I came to where you found me, scorched and smoking".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi took up the story, "We were supposed to back them up. Get them out if anything went wrong. So we followed along about twenty minutes behind them in one of the steam freight trains. Where the temple had been we found only a shattered wasteland. Beyond the still smoldering bits and pieces we found Shergar, stopped and smoking. Every last bit of paint had been burned away. The carriages were wrapped in smoke. When we entered we found blackened smoldering figures collapsed on the floor. It was the most awful thing I have ever seen. None of them looked as if they could possibly be alive. It was only as they began to struggle back to consciousness that we realized how lucky they had been. There were minor burns and injuries where people had bounced off the carriage sides as everything went up. Megren was the worst with second degree burns over all her exposed skin from where she was in the engine. We hooked up to the other train and pulled it to the nearest depot for emergency repairs. After that Shergar was able to limp back here under her own power. And that's our tale", Sammi said as she sat back, relaxing at last, the last traces of tension draining from her face in the firelight.</p>
<!-- REVISE or move?
<p class="regtxt5">For the first time Sammi really looked at their guest, blushing a bit as she realized how she's been acting. Kali was an attractive woman, at least to eyes that appreciated true beauty. Her boyish figure served to accentuate her curves, producing a figure that was both androgynous and feminine at the same time. Combined with her long auburn hair, mysterious sea-grey eyes and warm, friendly face, she made quite a figure sitting in the firelight. Sammi continued to gaze at her above the rim of her tankard, taking in the long green skirt, black long sleeved top and green waistcoat, "she's like one of the faery folk", she thought.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Meanwhile Kali was examining her two new friends almost as closely. Sammi was the shorter of the two, just over five feet, with long flowing blonde hair, dancer’s build and deep blue eyes set in a high cheek boned face. Jemima was taller and a bit more solidly built with dark curly locks and pleasant rounded features.</p>
-->
<p class="regtxt5">They were still sitting after Sammi had finished her descriptions. Jemima was reliving parts of it, Sammi was still locked in the images of the aftermath, and Kali was seeing fragments of it. As they shook their heads, trying to clear the images, a band entered and began setting up. Something about them seemed very familiar to Kali, like she should know them from somewhere. After a few moments the lead singer turned and she could see her. "That's not Inkubus Sukkubus over there, is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It most certainly is", Jemima grinned back at her, "I trust you can dance?" she added, laughing eyes smiling at her above her tankard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She grinned back, trying not to let the clawing fear show in her face. The old familiar patterns of it began to build in her, but the music was so infectious that it began to ease a bit. Soon she was swaying and moving in her seat to the power of the music swirling around the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the second song began she suddenly found herself on her feet moving and swirling among the other dancers. Softly it slipped into her mind, driving the fear out and slowly becoming the focus of her every thought. At first her movements were stiff and awkward, but as the music slowly worked its way into her she could feel her joints popping and loosening like cracking the ice on fall puddles to reveal the water, still fluid, underneath.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The music wove a bright shimmering pattern in her head that her feet were compelled to follow. Surprise flared briefly that she could dance at all, then the music drove itself back to the center. Her random and disjointed movements slowly coalesced into a woven tapestry of cat like grace and flow. She became obsessed with matching the ethereal pattern she could sense only dimly. Then it happened, like stepping through a doorway. The pattern flared into three-dimensional brilliance and everything became one. There was no Kali, there was no music, no pub, no band, no people, just the dip and flow of the pattern. Within it was the peace and completeness she'd longed for all her life. For an instant she saw windows and doorways into the past, the future, the now, saw what she had only imagined as she had tried to write of racial memories, of pasts back to the beginnings of time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was no sense of time or space until the music slowly faded away and the silence brought her back to the pub. Without a thought she bowed deeply to the band, then the thunder of applause rolled over her. It was only then she noticed everyone else had drawn back into a circle to give her room to dance. Panic surged through her as she realized she had been the center. Her gaze flicked and darted as she sought a way to safety. As her eyes darted across the gaze of the lead singer, the singer saw her, laughed, and launched into "Wytches". Suddenly the pattern surged and beckoned once more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi grabbed one hand as Jemima grabbed the other. Soon everyone was linked in a circle snaking and turning through the pattern. For a time she held back a bit, enjoying the contact with new friends, then as the band shifted into another song she let go and returned to the pattern. Too soon it was over. Exhausted, they staggered back to their table. Soon Jo had brought pints of water. Gratefully they sipped them and slowly regained their breath.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The promise of a hot bath drew her when she arrived home. She discovered one of the joys of being a Writer was not having to wait for hot water, even on the top floor of a building. Within moments she was curled up in her tub, relaxing in the lightly jasmine scented water. When the water had cooled to discomfort she pulled herself out, dried off, and made her way to bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As she lay there the oddity of Inkubus Sukkubus drew her attention again. The more she thought about them the more she wondered how had they been at the bar. That led to wondering if they had been shifted like she had, or if they were an echo of their presence elsewhere. Which led into wondering if a Writer had Written them there. Here she was a Writer and yet she was also a character in what was being Written. It did seem to fit, in an odd sort of way, as she realized she had always been a watcher who would sometimes participate. Her next thoughts were more disturbing. She began to wonder if the Story had come to have a life of its own. She guessed it must have, at least on some level. Was that level enough to sustain it if she or Jack died. She didn't know and hoped she wouldn't have to find out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was reminded of a theory a gaming friend of hers had once mentioned. It stated that gods were created by the beliefs of their followers. The more followers, the more power, the more influence on ‘reality’. Maybe it worked the same with Written worlds. After all, words were symbols linked in patterns, and reality was patterns. Maybe, she thought, the old alchemists had it right when they said power resided in words, words as symbols. Other thoughts struggled to intrude but sleep pulled her down before they formed.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">She awoke the next morning refreshed, quickly dressed, and headed off to meet Sammi and Jemima for breakfast. They laughed and carried on over huge amounts of food. At last she asked the question that had been on her mind during most of the meal, "Umm, I'm still not too certain what I should be doing, and I need to be doing something. I don't want to feel like a parasite here, and I know I told Jack I wanted to visit. Now that I'm here I don't want to go back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We thought you might not want to. He was sure you would. What are you good at, besides dancing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, I'm good with technical things. If I can get it apart I can usually get it back together and working, I am also good with computers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know, you might go check at the train yards, last I heard they were needing more help. If you don't mind getting dirty it might be fun."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I'd enjoy that, although I'd like to go on some of the rescue assignments also."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't worry, almost everyone here goes at some point or another, some only the minimum number they can get away with. Some of us can't live without the excitement, even though there is great danger. Since it is the reason Death City exists it is a requirement that all residents participate in rescues once in a while. But enough for now. We can talk about that later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Soon Sammi and Jemima were finished and hurried off to their appointments. Kali set out, past the pub, toward the dark river, running silent through the city. Following the path she passed through a gate, out of the cathedral lands and then along the river walk until it passed under the great railroad bridge a bit further down stream. There she climbed a set of worn stone stairs up to the rail bed and crossed the river. Once across it was a short walk near the track to the Temple Heath Locomotive Depot. A couple of different people pointed her in the direction of one of the running sheds and Bartholomew, whom everyone called Bart, the man in charge.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She knew she was in the right place as soon as she opened the personnel door on the side of the huge old building. The warm scent of diesel oil, mixed with old smoke and lubricating oils rolled over her. She was so busy inhaling deeply and savoring the smells to notice the stares she was getting. Just as a man near the door started to ask her what she wanted she walked over to him and asked after Bart.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He answered, "Over near Shergar, he’s checking her after last night’s excitement. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I heard he was looking for techs, um I don't think I know the right term," She replied blushing under his scrutiny.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He looked her up and down a few times before pointing across the building to an older diesel electric locomotive. "He’s over there, in the large group of people near the engineer’s position."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks." She could feel his eyes on her as she crossed to the large knot of people. Conversation slowed at her approach, finally stopping as she asked, "Hi, I was looking for Bart? I wanted to talk with him about a maintenance position, but I can come back at a better time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm Bart, and nonsense young lady, this is a fine time. We were just rambling on about old Shergar and all she’s seen. Come with me a moment and we'll get you fixed up." He was huge and resembled the locomotives under his care. Tall and wide with a barrel chest and arms that looked as big as her thighs. Suddenly she wasn't so sure about this. She began to remember the pictures of locomotives she'd seen, most everything in them came in sizes large to huge.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time they reached his office she was having serious second thoughts. Just as she was about to apologize and slip quietly away Bart spoke, "I guess I should ask what your credentials are. What have you worked on? What background do you have?" At her dismayed look he just grinned and added, "None is really required, other than a willingness to get dirty, to learn, and to work hard, but I would like to know what you've done before now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She could see his opinion of her change as she described her experience, especially the time she spent as a seismic field service technician. "Good, we can use someone that understands that computer stuff and who can work under difficult conditions. Several of the latest locomotives have ‘microprocessor’ control systems in them. If you can start today I can assign you to the checkout of Shergar, that'll let you see how the older diesel-electrics work. She’s a good old one she is. It looks like she’s ok, but we wouldn't want her to quit in the middle of a run. Go over to the locker rooms and grab yourself a pair of dungarees and meet me back by her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Soon he was showing her oil points, valves, controls, pistons, vents, and numerous other things she was sure she wouldn't remember for many weeks. "Got all that? I'll test you on it tomorrow," he said with a grin. "It'll take time, but not as much as you expect."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She only worked half the day but still it was enough to exhaust her. Her arms felt like limp noodles from all the lifting, pushing, pulling and twisting that she'd done, but there was a great deal of satisfaction too. She couldn't remember when working had felt so good.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She hurried home, changed and headed for the Adam and Eve, trying to remember if Sammi and Jemima were going to join her that night.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">She was headed for Sammi’s table when Bart’s voice stopped her. "Hey Kali, don't be a stranger, come sit with us." She quickly spotted Bart at the tables grouped in the center of the room. Cheeks flaming, embarrassed by the attention, she hastily made her way to an empty chair. "You're one of us now, for good or ill," Bart continued with a huge smile. He turned and waved at Jo, "Bring Kali one of her usuals, would you? Thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali’s stout had just arrived when Sammi walked in and headed toward her table. She looked around for a few moments before she spotted Kali. "So, already abandoning your friends for these guys?" she asked smiling. "Hey Bart, how’s the loco?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not nearly as bad as you had me believing you scamp. Where’s your better half?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Setting it up so Kali can ride in the cab with us to Portal Station tomorrow. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just thought she should be keepin’ an eye on you is all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You! Kali, watch out for that one. He’s trouble."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, she just starts at the yards and already you're taking her away. It’s a wonder I can get anything done around here." He turned and winked at Kali. "Just remember, the longer you keep her, the longer it'll take to get your locomotive back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi was about to reply when Jemima burst in and started toward them. "Got it!" She said, waving a scrap of paper in one hand. She pulled Sammi into a tight hug before turning to Kali and continuing, "Tomorrow morning you get to go to Portal Station with us, in the cab of the loco."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pull up a couple of chairs and join us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes sir, mister Bart, sir." Jemima answered with a smile as she grabbed a chair and spun it to the table. Sammi quickly settled into one of her own and they spent the rest of the evening in pleasant conversation.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">As Jemima rose to leave she turned to Kali, handed her the cab pass, and said, "Meet us at Central Station, at sunrise, with the permit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Muscles protested as Kali stood. She stifled a groan and waved at the table, "See you guys later. I'm home for bed." She slowly made her way home and labored up the stairs to her rooms, where she quickly started a hot bath, after dropping a generous amount of bath salts into the tub. As the steam rose, she stripped and sank slowly into the rising water. Soon she was drifting through half formed thoughts as the heat loosened her tired muscles.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tired and finally pain free she slipped into bed and drifted right into sleep. The next thing she remembered was the full moon shining into her room. It must have been the middle of the night, yet it seemed almost as bright as day. Worse, she was wide-awake. She lay there for long minutes, willing herself to sleep again. At last she gave it up and climbed out of bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She wandered the room for a while until the pull of the moonlight became too much. Hurrying to her wardrobe she pulled out the cat suit, saw how tightly it would fit, and threw it in the back corner. She pulled on a flight suit instead. As she turned to the stairs, the doors and the balcony above her garden caught her eye. In seconds she had slipped onto the balcony and from there onto the slope of the roof. She waited for the fear and vertigo that had followed her most of her life to overwhelm her once again. It whispered in the back of her mind, but didn't come forward very far. After waiting a few minutes she prowled along the left ridge line to the end of the building. There was a three-foot gap and a ten-foot drop between her roof and the next one over. Looking over to the end of the right ridge line showed the same three-foot gap and a drop of 8 feet. Frustrated she stalked back to the windows and headed down into the building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her hand was on the main doors when she remembered the horrible squeal it would make if she opened it. Not wanting that level of noise she slipped deeper into the building. A hallway led down the left side and ended at a door. Carefully she turned the knob. This door opened on silent hinges and let her out into the narrow canyon between her building and the ones behind it. Here and there shapes huddled in the deeper shadows. A closer look revealed people under blankets and in large coats. They had to be street people, but they didn't look quite as beaten down as the ones she was used to. The clothes they wore were somewhat clean and in reasonable repair and they didn't smell like they feared water and soap.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She started toward the street when she heard a large group approaching, probably from the Adam and Eve. Quickly she ducked back into the alleyway, only to be brought up short as a woman’s voice said, "Ye need not fear them. Ye be safe in Death City and in all Eternia from the rest of us. It be only yourself ye need fear."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Startled, Kali snapped out, "What do you know of me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ye be one of the rare ones. Ye walk the shadow line by choice, that be why ye have the hand of the Dark Mother on ye. Ye did not die to come here. Your transition is a different one, it be of flesh and spirit. Yet e’en so, ye be less than comfortable in yer skin."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shadow walker, fence rider, great, another place where I'm too much in the center to be valid. What gives you the right to judge me?" she spat out, her face twisted into a sneer by bitterness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ye don't understand, do ye girl? Here Shadow Walkers have a place. Ye walk between worlds here, as ye walked between extremes in the realms. This is the place between, a place where the tasks of salvation and rescue are taken seriously. Balance and center are very important. Here those that understand 'Between' have the best time of it. Here ye be judged only by how ye aid those around ye and ye be safe from all but yourself. Beyond these borders though, that be a different matter. The forces of evil will seek to destroy ye, to prevent ye thwarting them. The forces of good may walk over ye, confusing ye with the evil uns. Always the Dark Mother watches over, she who was before the Lessers. But here I'm chattering on like some crazy magpie and ye be cold of spirit. Go, find yer peace. Old Lizbet be here when ye want to talk again girl. This alley be my home."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Strangely calmer, Kali made her way to the front of her building, where she could see the cathedral in all its glory. She didn't see the old woman shimmer and fade into the night. The cathedral drew her closer as she studied the flying buttresses and spires arrogantly poking into the heavens. As she neared the building she began to see small cracks and gaps in the stonework. Before she really thought about it she was climbing. Each new foothold spurred her hands to seek the next space. Slowly and steadily she worked her way up a buttress, across an arch and higher up along the roof line. Her fingers and feet seemed to know just where to go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After an hour of steady climbing she reached the top of the highest spire. Wind whistled through her hair and the moon bathed her in silvery light. Something started to shift in her. The last terror of heights faded quickly before the light, wind, and stunning views. To the east and north the river curled it's way around the cathedral close. Very slightly to the north and east was the Adam and Eve, and to the south and west, Central Station, where she would join Sammi and Jemima in the morning. To the west was her building and another section of the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the sun began to color the wispy clouds in the east she began the climb back down to the street. Her body protested, stiff and sore from the exertion of the climb and unused to it from years in office jobs. When she saw the openings to the belfry, she figured what the hell and slid inside. From there she boldly strode down the stairs and out onto the street, receiving a couple of startled looks from others in the cathedral, but otherwise no one said a word.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She headed toward the path along the river. As she turned past the Adam and Eve she headed as if to Temple Heath. Once she reached the rail bed she turned away from the river and followed a pathway to the front of the station. She stopped in awe of the beauty of that massive old building. Victorian architecture soared skyward and massive sections of glass glistened in the coming light.</p>
