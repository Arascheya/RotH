Below is a brief description of what I had in mind. It is not cast in stone, so it can be fiddled to make it better. :)
For a more complete picture of Kali you can read the Death City story about her starting with this chapter: http://www.snowdancer666.com/forbill/docs/DeathCity/kali_full/arrival.htm
you will need the following to access the pages (both case sensitive):
UserID:  Dev
Password: angelique

follow the links to the next chapter on each page - this is a slightly hidden section at the moment, so don't use the link back to the Writings Index or you won't be able to get back to this section.

The basic scenario for the dance related questions:
Kali, of the Death City stories, has figured out she has the coordination, for the first time in her life, to dance. She has been doing so at the local goth club since she figured it out. Her style is more interpretive than just regular person dancing at the club. As a result she has been noticed for this.

Through a series of circumstances she is asked by the house band of the club to be the stage dancer during their performances. When she starts working on things to do she begins to realize she may have some basic moves, but she wants to learn more, to really understand and figure out what would make her good.

A friend of hers has been taking lessons at a place in town and recommends Kali come and check it out. The first scene would be Claire (Kali's friend) taking her off to class. - so some questions are - what should Claire tell Kali to wear, bring, be ready for at her first class. Claire is a beginner basically, although she's been taking classes for a while. The classes are more of an independent thing rather than for a specific dance troupe. although, this could be changed as well if you have some good ideas for a more interesting situation.

The town is maybe Madison sized or a bit smaller, composed of various Death City persons - many who have not yet been designed...:)
