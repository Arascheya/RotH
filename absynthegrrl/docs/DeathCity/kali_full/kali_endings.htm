<p class="pagecaption">Endings</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Petrov entered the car and found Kali staring out into the passing void. When she made no sign of noticing him he said, "Ma'am?" A few minutes later, "Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Petrov," she replied. Dementia would have recognized the empty, distant voice, but it was one Petrov had never heard. "Do not ask the universe for a purpose, it may grant your wish. If you already have, pray it never answers you," Kali spoke without turning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned a bit, twisted her mouth into a brief, grimaced smile that fled almost before he saw. "I asked once, and now I have been answered with the solution to this war." Kali shivered. "Our indiscrete relationship meant far more to me than I dared let on. Thank you." She turned back to the window. "I have one regret, that I could never believe my friends love me as much as they do. I wish I had time to remedy that failing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali?" real fear entered Petrov's voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would ask two things of you, Petrov."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stopped and he waited. At last Petrov prompted, "Yes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Keep them safe when I am no longer able to. And don't forget me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Forget you? Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are three avatars in this war. The one for the powers of 'light', one for the powers of the 'dark', and one for Eternia. When we meet this last time, we must cancel each other out. Keep everyone from interfering, it would only cost more lives." Kali stared out the window in silence for a long time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I suppose you have to do this." It was as much a statement as a question.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned toward him a tiny bit and gave a very small nod. "All my life I wanted to die. You saw it, and I knew it. Now that it is upon me, I want more than anything to live."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have friends and lovers now, holding you here." She nodded again. "Does Merris know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Again Kali nodded. "She was there when Dementia and I figured it out. If you could make sure she doesn't do anything foolish, I'd really appreciate it." Petrov noded. A tear slipped down the side of her face. "One last thing, if you could..." Petrov waited. "Hold me and tell me everything will be alright."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned uncertainly as he akwardly gathered her in his massive arms. She clung to him and shook as she cried for all the might have beens of her life. He gathered her up, carried her to a chair, and settled into it with her in his arms. They sat in silence for hours as the sounds of the train continued around them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At last Kali pulled back a bit and said, "It is time. Gather the squad commanders in the dining car. I will be there in a moment." Slowly his arms released her. She rose and walked to the bath room. A few minutes later she followed him from the car.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali strode into the dining car, set a thick stack of papers on the front table, and sat. She </p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need actual phase 1 in here and lead up to this last bit */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Its about balance - there is an avatar for the "good', an avatar for the "bad", so we got an avatar of the Lady. We can continue fighting this escalated war or it can be returned to the way it should be. But the balance has to remain, to end their avatars we must loose ours as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I told you how I begged for a vision, a purpose so very long ago. It has finally been answered and now I no longer want to go. But this has to end, before so many more of us die." her eyes were empty and old in a face etched with age and sadness. "It is time to end this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stepped away from her friends and began a slow dance of seduction. Softly and slowly it built until it was a siren call to the dark and light. Pale tendrils swirled out from her and drew the opposing leaders closer to her. Black ropes and shimmering white flowed in toward her until she danced in a tangle of it. The dark priest smiled and pulled on his web, the priestess of light laughed and tugged on her strands, and Kali danced on, unaffected.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The smiles faded into masks of rage, then fear as Kali danced a swirling spiral tug, pulling the two opposing leaders closer and closer to her. Sweat poured off her as energy snapped and crackled around her. The Death City forces pulled back as the fringes pulsed over them, raising hair in static laden tufts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali sent a last sad look at her friends as she pulled the two leaders into her arms. A soft pop was all they heard as the three ceased to be. The demonic and angelic hordes bearing down on them paused, then broke and ran. The dark portal rapidly faded leaving only a grey stone wall where once it had been. The pillar of light snapped off, as if a giant switch had been flipped. The forces that had been running for their gates slid to a stop and milled about, uncertain of where to go or what to do.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Eternia forces drew back in a somber procession, entered their train, and headed back to Eternia. Here and there people sat together, holding each other, crying. Others stared resolutly ahead either trying not to cry or with slow tears tracking down their faces.</p>
