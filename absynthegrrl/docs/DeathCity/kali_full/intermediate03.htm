<p class="regtxt5">/* Baldwin Locomotive Works info */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Baldwin locomotive works
The Baldwin Locomotive Works was founded in 1831 by Matthias Baldwin. The original plant was on Broad street in Philadelphia, PA where the company did business for 71 years until it moved in 1912 to a new plant in Eddystone. An arial view of the Baldwin plant is shown on the right. Today, F. W. Hake's Trucking Co. occupies this land.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Baldwin made its reputation building steam locomotives for the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe.and many of the other railroads in North America and for overseas railroads in England, France, India, Haiti and Egypt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the late 1940's it was very clear that the steam locomotive days were over and each of the big three steam locomotive builders were far behind EMD with diesel designs and customers. Lima merged with engine builder Hamilton in an effort to get a foot hold in the diesel market but made little progress. In despiration Lima-Hamilton merged with Baldwin in 1950 to become the Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corporation. However, by 1956 BLH ceased production of common carrier size locomotives.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the later days of the steam era, Baldwin was in the forefront of locomotive construction with the many 2-8-2 Mikados it built and its ability to build small quantities of unique designs, such as the Cab Forward 4-8-8-2's it built for the Southern Pacific. Also it was envolved with its various railroad customers to develop new and improved locomotive designs the last being the 4-8-4 Northerns.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Most of the records of Baldwin were destroyed in 1954. What survived has found its way to the De Golyer Library at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX. A few drawings are located at the Pennsylvania State Archives in Harrisburgh, PA. The Builders Photos are located at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg, PA.</p>
