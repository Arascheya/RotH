<p class="pagecaption">Journeys - Into the Void</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali stood and admired the station as the sun climbed higher into the sky. At last she turned and entered. A quick flash of the cab permit from Sammi and the conductor waved her past, pointing toward the head of the train. She slowly walked toward the engines, stopping once and a while to admire the gleaming blue and gold coaches along the way. Soon she emerged from the traceries of the overhead glass and ironwork. She passed the last three coaches and reached the twin diesels, already idling in preparation for departure. Even at idle they radiated power and presence. Fascinated she walked slowly by them before stopping to lean against a nearby signal gantry. Sammi had told her this wasn't their normal train. Shergar and her coaches would be in the works for many weeks yet. Sammi had managed to wrangle a driving turn for the upcoming short trip to Portal Station. These locomotives were Class 37 diesel electrics, not the Napier Marine Deltic that Shergar was.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">While she waited she looked around at the other platforms, watching the other trains arriving and departing.  Railroad equipment from dozens of different countries, or worlds, were waiting or being serviced. It produced a wonderful riot of color and shape. Abruptly a short train roared away from the next platform, rapidly disappearing into the dawn brilliance across the rail bridge. As it vanished in the distance strong arms grabbed her from behind while Sammi’s voice asked, "What shall we do with this one then?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She spun when Sammi released her and grabbed her new friends in a quick hug, "Bright greetings!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I suppose we'll have to take her with us." Jemima answered.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The sound of moving pulleys caught their attention as the signal above their heads changed to ‘Clear’. Sammi led the way to the lead locomotive and they scrambled aboard. Behind them there were shouted good-byes and sounds of slamming doors. Somewhere in the distance was a shouted, "Hey, wait for me!" Followed by an answering, "Hey, Kyrnan, can't you ever be on time?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi moved to the driver’s seat and motioned Kali to the other chair while Jemima moved behind Sammi and settled her hands on her shoulders. Sammi unlocked the controls and activated the warning devices. Kali watched with intense interest as Sammi went through each step of departure. A whistle blew in the distance, which Sammi answered with a short blast from the horn as she released the brake. With a jaunty grin she eased the power controller open. There was a slight lurch as the traction motors took up the load. With a snarl the locomotives began to ease forward. Like a waking beast it slowly gained speed as it clawed its way down the track.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, Stick your head out and have a listen", Sammi called over the rising roar of the engines, "I'm going to thrash this one!" Jemima reached over and opened the cab side door near her while Kali and Sammi opened the windows near them. Leaning out, as the slow moving train cleared the end of the platform, Kali could see the varnished coaches smoothly gliding along behind.  Sammi opened her controller a bit more, now the two Class 37s really began to roar, and Kali felt the train surge forward.  With a clatter of wheels on joints they were on the river bridge, glancing back into the cab Kali could see the Cathedral spire through the open door beyond Jemima.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jemima’s eyes were shut as she drank in the singing of the diesels. Sammi kept the regulators set just below the maximum limits as they roared along. Power sang through the floor and chair that Kali sat in. She leaned out the window again and reveled in the whipping wind. Soon they thundered through open park land and then over a small rise and down through an industrialized valley. It took only moments to rush through the brick lined cuttings, under plate girder bridges, and back out into the warm sunlight.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As their speed passed sixty, Kali pulled her head back out of the brutal wind. Her gaze drifted to her new friends. Jemima was leaning close to Sammi, stroking her shoulders while one of Sammi’s hands rested on hers. They almost glowed with the love they shared. Suddenly Sammi looked at her and winked, letting her know they had been aware of her gaze.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi reluctantly shut the power down when their speed reached eighty. The engines dropped back to the low rumble of their idle as the train coasted along at eighty-two miles per hour. Other routes branched off to the right and left with growing frequency. The main line had increased to four tracks and was running under an elaborate overhead signaling system. Kali could make nothing of them but Sammi seemed to know exactly what they were saying.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soon the four main lines increased to six and Sammi smoothly eased over to the right hand pair of lines. They were running through what looked like the industrial zone of a large Victorian working city. Factories, mills, and brick works stood along the lines and canals and wagon ways wove a tight web tying the rest of the city to the tracks. Ahead, on a hill rising higher than the chimneys and warehouses, were buildings of white stone, surrounded by spaces of green. The four left most lines headed toward it, curving slightly to the left, then running straight into a gradually deepening cutting. The twin tracks they were on branched to the right and ran through a valley of rock walls, swinging away from the city center and arrowing toward the distant mountains.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi pulled the controller wide open again as they cleared the city junctions and headed out into the suburban areas. Large houses with tree shaded lawns and gardens swept past while another junction brought two lines in from the city to join and form four lines again. Then they were climbing, here just gentle slopes that slowly brought them out of the green valleys and into the rolling foothills of the approaching mountains. Sheep placidly gazed at them as they roared by.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Could I ask you about this place? About Death City and Eternia?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You can. What would you like to know?" Jemima replied.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why everyone is so reluctant to tell me about it. How I got here. Why I got here. How does this place work?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Truth is they aren't being guarded on purpose, it's more that most of us don't know much. The Dark Lady determines who comes here and she hasn't told any of us how she decides. She arranges the way you get here as well. Again it's different for everyone and it is sort of a hard thing for most to talk about. There's usually loss and pain when it happens. As for how this place works, well, that's a bit simpler. Everyone has a desire to contribute, so they find things they don't mind doing and then they do them. You've met Big Joe and Jo, they enjoy running the Adam and Eve. Bart likes to work on the trains. And so it goes. We like the rush of missions, so we are out most of the time. It varies from person to person. It is expected that you will go out once in a while, but if you don't like it, you don't have to do it very often."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">An hour later they were clinging to the side of the Mountains of Chaos. The four lines ran along a narrow ledge of stone blasted from the living rock of the towering mountains. Deep shadows blanketed the tracks, where the high peaks blocked the sun, and lent a dark mystery to the scene. The engines strained at maximum power rolling along at just under seventy-five. Narrow valleys and high waterfalls broke free in spots, one so close the spray left patterns on the wind screen. Moments later they screamed into a short tunnel, its walls throwing back the pulse of the engines. Immediately beyond the tunnel was a long span arching over a dizzying drop to a large river far below. Once again Kali was glad her fear of heights had faded. As they twisted and climbed higher the tunnels and bridges grew in numbers until they seemed to be alternately burrowing through the bones of the world and soaring through the heavens. Ahead, Jemima explained, lay the Great Portal, the main gate between Death City and Eternia and the rest of the universe. At the Portal lay Portal Station where Sammi would hand the train over to the regular crew who would take it into the void.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Abruptly the line swung around the shoulder of another mountain and Kali could see the Portal. Vast it was, huge and ancient, forged by the gods themselves in the ancient deeps before time began. Its boundary was a massive oval of metal, the color of age stained bronze. Within it was a pulsing, writhing something that no matter how hard Kali looked it wouldn't define itself. It pulsed with all colors and no color, at once a flat sheet of nothing and a view of everything that ever existed. As she stared at it she found herself drawn into it. Always feeling if she stared for a minute longer it would resolve itself into something.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's best not to look at it for too long". Kali started slightly as Jemima touched her shoulder. Kali's mouth formed a silent "Oh", as she gradually brought her mind back from  the distant realms the Portal had carried her to. She was still aware of its vastness, towering above everything beyond the next range of mountains, but now she had recovered herself she would not again allow it to draw her gaze. Instead when she felt she just HAD to look at it, she would slip a sidelong glance its way, then quickly look back at something else.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sorry!" Sammi called above the roar of the engines, "we should have warned you. To be honest, it still freaks us out, and we've been here for years"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok", Kali responded, smiling across the cab at Sammi, "I'm glad I saw it. It's when you see things like that, things made not for mortal eyes, that you realize how precious a gift life is". Now the view of the Portal was being slowly cut off, as the train swung closer to the next range of mountains.  On the other side, Jemima explained, was the Junction she'd spoken about, right at the edge of the Portal.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The chasm the line was following branched in two, and Kali found herself crossing an impossible bridge, a slender arch of lattice girders carrying the line right across the bottomless void below, then they were over and plunged into utter darkness.  This final tunnel cut through the heart of the Mountains of Chaos. It was a four mile stretch of deepest black, cut through the living rock. Above it were the highest peaks of the range, one of the great barriers of Eternia. It threw back the sound of the diesels in ever increasing echoes until there was no escape from the pounding, crashing noise. Kali had never heard such sound before, on and on it went, amplified  and boosted, nothing could escape from it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As the pounding drove into her, she began to build a refuge of dance in her mind. As she danced her way deeper and deeper into the pattern a form began to take shape in front of her. Black as the void around the shining pattern, a necklace of skulls hung around her neck, the figure shimmered in front of Kali, ghostly, yet solid. Her voice blended in the echo of the roaring engines, "You have taken one of my names for your own. Yet you doubt yourself still. I gift you your word of power and I curse you to live the name you have chosen. You shall be as mother to your friends and as destroyer to your enemies. Your anger shall be quick and powerful, your love shall be boundless, yet the control of these sides shall be yours to master. You shall be remembered in the register of Death City - it is your choices that shall form the manner of that memory." Light flashed across her eyes, blotting out the vision as the train thundered out of the tunnel and began slowing to come to rest at the Portal Station.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She was still slightly dazed and disoriented as Sammi led her down from the cab and into the station to await their return. "Intense isn't it? It’s never become common for me! Now I don't know how long we'll have to wait. The Portal is always busy, but it could be some time before there’s room headed back."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Several trains came through during the next two hours, but they were all full of personnel or supplies. Shortly after yet another full train had slowly accelerated into the tunnel a voice boomed out over the announcement system, "Sammi, Jemima, Kali please come to dispatch."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi shot the other two a puzzled look as they quickly walked to the door next to the information counters. Kali looked from her to Jemima and back and asked, "This isn't normal then?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, usually we just wait until a train has space available and then get on." Sammi answered as she knocked on the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The door opened immediately to the cluttered office of the dispatchers. People were huddled in front of computer monitors displaying glowing traceries of lines and symbols. Beside each symbol was a name and number. As they entered a blond woman turned from her console as she pushed a hand through her already mussed and tangled hair. For a brief moment she just looked at Kali before saying, "We have a situation on Delestra 6 where the rescue mission has encountered heavy opposition. There is a team trapped under heavy fire. I need a small group to go in and set up an extraction. Try and get the train out. Failing that, set up a Rescue Beacon and Power Shield then dig in until we can get you. I'd like to send more people, but I don't have anyone close enough right now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi glanced at Jemima and quickly agreed. Then she turned to Kali and said, "If you want to come, you can, but no pressure. If you don't feel ready to jump into this high a danger, no one would have a problem with you declining."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali considered briefly then replied, "No, I'm here to make a difference. I'm not experienced yet, so if you think I would be a liability, then I'll stay, otherwise I'm in."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good! I have a train and driver waiting to go as soon as you board." She handed Sammi a large packet and continued, "This is all the information we have on the area. It was supposed to be a quiet zone so we didn't prepare for this. Good luck!" She then turned back to her console and keyed a couple of switches, then began talking softly into the headset she wore. With a grin and a wave to the room Sammi was bounding out. The other two followed almost as quickly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They were met at the train by a long haired boyish looking man who Kali was certain she should recognize. "Welcome aboard!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once on board Sammi and Jemima took Kali to a weapons locker. Sammi pulled out a blaster rifle and handed it to her. "Have you ever used a gun before?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A pistol a couple of times with a friend of mine."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good, this isn't a lot different. Actually it should be easier, there’s no recoil to worry about. This is a MK986 heavy assault blaster. It can deliver one blast every two seconds and has a power pack good for 50 shots. It comes with an optional backpack assembly that boosts the number of shots to 1000. This particular one also has the add on grenade launcher attached. It holds five grenades and has a range of about 40 meters. It doesn't take long to get used to it and where we're going it sounds like there will be no trouble finding targets."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The train began moving as they dropped into nearby seats. Jemima snagged the packet and tore it open. Soon she had papers and maps spread out, covering a small table, and was intently studying what she found. Her finger traced a subway route then stopped under a large building. "This is where dispatch believes the team is right now. They were supposed to enter the subway system, then use it to access three additional locations. The last communication from the team indicated they had completed recovery operations on two of their three targets but were pinned down in the subway while trying to get to the third." Jemima pointed to another page of drawings and continued, "This is where they recommend we go in. Rather than risking getting trapped in the subways, we'll come in at the old train depot on the surface." She traced a small dotted line over to the first page. "Following this drain system should put us near the museum section of the tunnel. With any luck we won't have to fight our way through major forces until we reach the subway tunnels themselves. After that, we play it as it falls. Our main goal is to recover the team, after that we'll see what we can do."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't understand, what is a Rescue Beacon? Can't they just send a train in the way the original team went in?" Kali asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Normally yes, except the regular routes might take a long time to traverse. A Rescue Beacon allows dispatch to create a track route directly to the trouble spot. Help can arrive very quickly that way. A Power Shield is a magic device that raises a shield around an area. If we can't end the battle we can hide inside the shield until help arrives."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Almost too quickly a large thump and bang announced the train was back on real space track and slowing as it thundered through wrecked buildings and stacks of rubble. With a final hiss of brakes it rumbled to a stop in the center of a burned and tumbled shell of old stone and brickwork. Within moments they were standing away from the tracks as the train clawed its way into motion again. Quickly it accelerated down the tracks and roared through an opening in the far wall.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi and Jemima were already settling their packs and gear as Kali turned from watching the departing train, still trying to remember why the driver had looked so familiar. Then it came to her, she had seen that same picture on a web page. He was Jack, the other Writer. With a grin she turned and joined Sammi and Jemima, adjusting her pack and blaster as she walked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It took some searching to find the stairs down under all the rubble in the main areas. Then it took more time to slip and crawl over and around it to the old subway passages below. By the time they reached the lower platform they were covered in old soot, ash and cement powder. At first the going was easy as they followed the old passages to the subway station located below. Then they pulled up a large grate and dropped into the storm drains. For about 20 meters it was dry and easy then it turned and angled down. Slime and oil covered the bottom of the tunnel as it descended to meet a larger pipe. Here there was a thick floor of viscous mud and water.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The tunnel slanted down a ways further until they were wading through thick water or thin mud. Sammi grinned at Kali and commented, "This would be fun at any other time! Well, except for the stench. Right now it’s just a nightmare." About 500 meters along this tunnel Jemima motioned to the left and up a short ladder to a smaller tunnel. Single file they climbed up and into it, crouching as they went to avoid the lower curve of it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The unease started slowly with a prickling at the back of Kali's neck. As they silently crept single file through the tunnel she found her hands tightening up on the blaster she carried. Eyes seemed to stare at her from the blackness around them and every sound seemed more and more ominous. Insecurities whispered to her of failure and death. Heart pounding she focused on Sammi in front of her and tried to ignore her rising panic. Her hands were beginning to hurt from clenching her blaster when Jemima signaled a halt at the last ladder up. She scrambled up for a look then trained her blaster on an old, rusty lock. It took only one shot to destroy it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">No surprise attacks greeted them as slipped into the tunnel above. They passed a side branch and another curve before Jemima held up her hand to hold. A reddish glow pulsed and throbbed from around the next bend. They could hear screams of pain and howls of rage broken every so often by the sound of weapons fire.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Softly they crept forward and rounded the bend. Grotesque lanky grey figures shrieked and gibbered as they threw themselves into the small knot of people huddled behind piles of rubble on the subway platform. Sporadic weapons fire would drive back the closest grey things and for a moment there would be a break then the grey things would close again. Sammi motioned at Jemima to take one side and for Kali to follow her into the other side.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For the first few seconds they had surprise and cut into the ranks of the grey beings. Then they turned and charged. Black bolts of energy leapt from a tall shape in the shadows of a stairway. It blasted a chunk of cement from the floor where Sammi had just leapt from. Kali froze as the mob of creatures rushed toward her. Then Sammi shoved her back yelling, "Snap out of it! Dance, damn it!!" A long narrow hand with razor claws ripped through the space where she had just stood. It was enough to break her loose. With an cat-like roar she spun and began firing back into the charging crowd. Twisting and dodging she kept herself out of danger while hurting her share of the enemy.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly the shadow spotted her and let loose with a wicked looking blast. In a move of pure desperation she dive-rolled over a fallen chunk of tunnel and heard an ominous crunching sound as she landed on her right shoulder. Sparks flashed from the damaged weapons pack on her back. Instinct drove her hands to the quick release on the straps as she dove away from it. A brilliant flash of heat and light told her how narrow her escape had been.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Now weaponless, she turned to retreat and saw Jemima knocked down by a glancing blow to her head. Something snapped inside her. An inhuman shrieking roar ripped through her throat as she hurled herself at Jemima’s attacker. Claws raked its throat out as she howled in triumph. Teeth pulled back in a snarling rictus of rage and feral joy she danced and wove her way through the left flank of grey beings. She left broken and bleeding corpses in a dark wake behind her. Teeth narrowly missed her and claws whistled around her as they tried to bring her down. Always she was just a fraction faster. Once she glanced back and saw Sammi, frozen, watching her. In a voice both terrifying and seductive she called, "Come, dance with me." The grey beings stopped and turned toward her, people started to rise from their covering locations, and Sammi walked toward her. The demonic forces shook off the thrall first and fired into the rising group of refugees, startling them into diving behind cover once more. Sammi blocked a blow by instinct, then shook her head and whirled back into the battle.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali continued her mad frenzy of destruction until a black blast shattered the floor at her feet. A howl of rage shredded her throat as she grabbed the nearest grey thing and hurled it into the stairs. It was still flailing as it slammed into the shadowy figure hiding there. She had a quick glimpse of a pulsing sparkle of light before slashing claws drew her back into the fray. Soon the entire left flank lay in bloody tatters at her feet. Still in a frenzy she spun seeking new targets and launched herself toward the nearest ones. As she drew back for a swing Jemima’s voice broke through, "Kali, it’s over. They're all dead. It’s over. We need to check the train and get a power shield readied before they bring in more."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As quickly as the frenzy had arrived, it departed. Kali was left standing and drained, with greenish blood, grey flesh, and ichor dripping from her curled fingers. It coated her clothes and clung to her skin. The smell of death slithered through the last of her adrenaline haze causing her to gag and retch. Confusion crossed her face as she croaked through her raw throat, "What happened? What have I done?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She touched you in the tunnel. The Lady touched you, didn't she?" Jemima asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I...I think so...No...she did, I remember..." Kali whispered as they walked toward the other team.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi had reached the other team and was making introductions as Kali and Jemima walked up. "Merris sent us to get you out of here. I am Sammi, this is Jemima, and this is Kali."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jemima asked, "Where is your driver?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Tom is," A woman replied, pointing to a man where he sat cradling a broken arm.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Are you able to drive?" He shook his head. "Anybody else know how?" The rest of them shook their heads no as well. She looked back Tom, "Do you think you could give Kali enough instruction that she could take the train out? We need to..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I can try..." Tom started to reply.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We need to go. All of us." a woman broke in rapidly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wha..." Tom started to say.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Trust me," she said with absolute conviction. "We'll be cut off in  minutes if we don't. Everyone, get the wounded on the train. We are leaving." She returned to speaking quietly into a com unit.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The team gathered their wounded and loaded them aboard. Tom stood shaking his head. "We aren't going anywhere. I was trying to tell you, the engine is damaged."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, think you could fix it?" Jemima asked. "Sammi and I can put up a shield in the passage before they come back. It should slow them down a bit."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe I can. Come on Tom." Tom trailed slowly after Kali as she hurried to the engine and disappeared on board.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The woman turned to one of her team mates, "Max, you're with me. The rest of you, whatever happens, don't let the train stop for anything."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Take the Power Shield," Sammi called.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, you need it to block the passageway by the stairs, where you were going a minute ago." She hurried up the rail tunnel with Max following along behind. Sammi stared after her, shook her head, then headed toward the passage with the shield device.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Inside the locomotive Kali was peering into the smoke from the engine section. Taking a deep breath she plunged in. Hoses, wires, and pipes ran everywhere. Narrow spaces snaked and twisted their way through the packed equipment. Nothing looked too bad until she came to a junction box for the traction motor feeds. Melted copper, charred bakelite, and burnt insulation greeted her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Tom, are there any tools? I need a socket set and some really big pliers."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Should be one in the back of the compartment. How's it look?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Bad. I may be able to cobble something together, I'll let you know." She reached for a melted section of wire then stopped. "Tom, how long would it take to start up again if we shut the diesels off? I don't want to get fried here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A couple of minutes. They'll still be pretty much warmed up."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good, would you please?" She waited until the engines wound down then began pulling on wires. Everything had been precisely installed, allowing for no slack. "I can make this work, but it will mean scavenging parts from the dynamic braking feeds. We will need to be really careful going down from Portal Station."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She worked rapidly cutting and joining, using scavenged connecting blocks and insulation pieces. At last she stepped back from the cobbled up mess. "Ok, start her up and lets see if this works."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The diesels slowly wound back to life. Everything seemed to hold together as Kali stepped back into the control cab. "Now, let's see if we can get out of here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Here, as driver you need to be in communication with the team lead." Tom picked up a com set from the control console. "There's a switch on the panel, there," he pointed to a selector, "That determines if you are talking to the train, the team wireless channel, or dispatch." Then he talked her through setting the Automatic Warning System. She cringed at the noise as it began to sound. She spun around and stabbed the cancel alert button before she even sat down. She dropped into the control chair and moved the reverser control lever to engine only and pulled the power handle towards her. The change in engine she expected didn't happen. Tom looked at her nervously, "That's not right. It should have responded immediately."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After a nervous glance out the windscreen she turned and climbed back into the engine compartment. Inside the compartment she could hear a ragged edge to the idling of the large engine next to her. As she moved toward the rear of the compartment she heard a faint hiss coming from the far side of the engine. Twisting and sliding around the engine she found a vacuum hose split where it slipped over a fitting on the fuel injection system. Grabbing it she pushed and twisted it until she managed to shove it far enough onto the fitting to get past the break. The slightly ragged edge immediately quieted as the big engine settled into a deep rumbling purr.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She scrambled quickly forward and took another nervous glance out the windscreen. The power shield was up and glowing a rich golden although behind it she could see moving forms collecting.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With hands suddenly sweaty she pulled the power lever again and was rewarded with a slow winding up of the engine behind her. Next she pushed the brake handle to the running position, drumming impatiently on the power handle as the vacuum gauges slowly crept up to 21 inches. When the needles touched the lowest edge of the mark she shoved the reverser into forward and pulled the power handle hard towards her. "Easy," Tom called. She grinned back at him and moved it back only when the ammeters almost touched red-line. Slowly the train began to move. As her speed started to climb she kept pulling the power handle to keep the ammeters just below the red. "Nice touch," Tom said.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The train continued to accelerate smoothly until it hit the first incline up out of the tunnel system. It began to slow quickly as its momentum was lost to gravity. Her speed continued to drop as she rounded a bend and saw two figures engaged in a magical fight with a horde of demons.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She started to push the amps harder when a voice crackled in her com, "Kali, coast a bit, we need to get those two."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm losing momentum, too much and we won't get going again..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Give us just a little bit. It'll be enough."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She kept her hand on the controller but didn't advance it. Their speed continued to drop until a walking person could out-pace them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Got them. Let's go!" Jemima called. Kali pushed the controller hard, running right at the bottom of the red zone. The smell of ozone filled the cab as she heard sparking coming from the back.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Jemima, prep for battle. My fix may not hold."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly the train strained forward. Ahead the tunnel banked right and continued to climb. Through the com she heard Jemima giving directions.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She rounded the bend only to see a figure standing in the tracks before her. Soon she was close enough to see Sammi waving at her to stop. One look at her speed and the ammeters convinced her there was no way she would be able to start again if she did. Instead she reached up and grabbed the horns, sounding them in a long blast. The figure ahead seemed to flicker slightly as the sound crashed over it. With a mumbled, "Shit, shit, shit..." she pushed the amps into the lowest area of the red zone. The figure flickered and changed into a smallish grey creature as it tried to dive out of the way of the train. With a whoop of triumph she stormed over it and around the next bend, into the light spilling in from the surface. Another minute brought her out of the tunnel and onto flat track. Moments later they were climbing away from Delestra 6.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You could be a driver if you wanted," Tom spoke from the jump seat.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You have the touch and you're good in a crisis. All you need is to learn the procedures and road rules." He leaned back and closed his eyes. "You need to call dispatch and report in. Ask for Merris and explain...No, wait," He stood awkwardly and fumbled in a cabinet behind the jump seat. He jammed a com unit on his head and continued, "I'll handle dispatch, you just listen and observe how it works."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dispatch, this is Delestra 6 train 2."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Delestra train 2, this is dispatch. Good to hear your voice again Tom."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Janine, wasn't sure we were going to make it. We need routing back. Be advised we are coming in with a damaged train, an inexperienced driver, and wounded."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Delestra train 2, so advised. We are giving you clear and direct routing. What is the nature of damage to your train?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dispatch, I will let Kali, replacement driver and mechanic, give you the details."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Um, this is Kali. To get moving I had to disable dynamic braking and use parts to get the traction motors back on line. We have air braking only."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Understood. What level of driving certification do you hold?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"None. I am the only one available. Tom is injured but able to talk me through the process." She heard a sharp indrawn breath on the on the end.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Delestra 6 train 2, this is Merris, head dispatcher. I will be your contact for the rest of the journey. Kali, how did you end up driving?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sammi and Jemima had to tend to the power shield, and then there was a secondary attack. We didn't have time to switch. Most of the original team are injured and none were driving rated either."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok. Is Tom well enough to help for the entire journey to Portal Station?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Merris, yes I am," Tom replied.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good. I'm going to give you the simplest routing I can. Please stop at Portal Station. I might be able to provide a relief driver at that time. Otherwise maybe Sammi could take over."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It felt like hours and like minutes at the same time until they reached the Portal and Portal Station. Not knowing the finer points of when to release power and begin braking caused Kali to finally stop about a hundred meters past the station buildings.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Merris, I'm afraid I didn't do so well on the stop. I'm still on the siding, but just barely."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good enough for now. Could you come on in? I'd like to see you. Ask Sammi and Jemima to as well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali made the call back to the train and then climbed down and slowly walked back to the station. Sammi and Jemima joined her as she neared the station doors. "Knew you could do it!" Sammi commented as she pulled Kali into a tight hug.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The station seemed to be deserted as the made their way to dispatch. Kali knocked on the door. After a long wait the door swung open and a frazzled man’s face came into view, "Yes?" His eyes widened as he caught sight of the three of them and the state they were in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We're back from Delestra 6. Merris wanted us to check in."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just wait here a minute." He turned and shouted back into the room, "Hey Merris, it's the group from Delestra, you want to talk to them?" She couldn't quite make out the reply before he turned back and said, "Wait here a moment."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris stood and rapidly make her way toward the door. She stopped and stared at Kali for long moments. Slightly uneasy from the scrutiny Kali began, "Sorry for the mess..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">""No, no, it's ok. I know you guys had it rough..." Her voice trailed off as she looked again. Just as Kali was about to speak again she said, "Sorry, just a lot on my mind... What were you saying?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The train's back. I don't know what to do with it next and I was wondering if you had a relief driver. Or if Sammi had to take it over."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"First congratulations are in order for getting the train and crew back. And congratulations to you, Kali, on successfully driving it back. We're short on drivers right now, so Sammi will have to take it down. I'll clear you the simplest routing to the Temple Heath yards and call ahead to have the healing teams standing by."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali turned to follow Jemima back to the coaches as they approached the train. "Oh no you don't. I think you should drive down. Tom and I can keep you out of trouble."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But Merris..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, she won't know, will she? I'll take the com and Tom and I will help with the signals and procedures. Unless you really don't want to?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali hesitated for long moments until a wicked grin finally split her face. "No, let's do it."</p>
