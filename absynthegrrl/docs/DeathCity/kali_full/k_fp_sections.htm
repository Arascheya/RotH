<p class="regtxt5">I was staring at the damn schematic and still couldn't figure it out. The more I tried to concentrate the more angry and restless I became. The calm after dancing at my flat and the Cathouse flashed across my mind. "You doing ok?" Bart's question coalesced the anger into a hot brand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. It isn't making any sense. I don't see anything that could cause the problems we are seeing." I pushed a hand through my tangled hair. Irritation and frustration burned like acid under my skin. "Damn it, what the fuck am I missing?" Suddenly I had to move or explode in Bart's face. "I'll be back," I snarled as I leapt up and stalked to the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outside I found a clear section near some track and launched into movement. At first it was sporadic and crazed until my body found a rhythm. Muscles flowed and joints stretched as the routine slipped together by itself. Slowly the anger burned away to be replaced with calm. An image of a small notation floated into my mind as I slowed to a stop. I glided back into the shop and over to the stack of drawings. Pawing through them rapidly I found the reference and headed for the storage area.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption"><a NAME="fp_shop">Shopping with Claire</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Claire led the way to an older section of town. A a maze of narrow cobbled streets twisted a snake path through brightly painted wooden beam and plastered wall buildings with slate roofs. Bright flowers and plants struggled bravely against the chill of late fall. Here and there small clots of people sat at outdoor tables enjoying coffee or food and soft guitar music drifted on the breeze.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire stopped in front of a small shop window displaying black corsets, leather, and lace dresses, and heavy boots glittering with buckles and zippers. "Here we are, best Gothic fashion shop in all of Death City." Claire commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I followed her in and felt the brain freeze starting. I couldn't remember what I was going to look for or what look I wanted to try out. I took a few more steps and stared around blankly. It all crashed in again, small, beautiful clothes for small, beautiful people. Nothing here for someone like...and then it stopped as I remembered the body in the mirror.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't even know where to start." I wanted to run back out the door and head for home. The brain lock went from knowing there was nothing for me to knowing there were too many choices to choose from. In fact I had already started to turn toward the door and didn't really catch the look on Claire's face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I try to start with an idea. Focus on a look you like and try it. That way I only grab a few items at a time to try. Once you have a few items, try them on and see how they look."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took a long moment for her words to penetrate. I tried to remember what I had seen while dancing that I might have liked. In desperation I turned toward the nearest rack. Black crushed velvet tops hung there in a wide range of sizes. Sizes, I had no clue what size I had become. I barely remembered what I was able to wear in the Realms, other than most fashions were too small. Hesitantly I approached and pulled one off the rack. It had purple front panels and was laced up the front. Low cut, it still had long sleeves, large and puffy at the top, form fitting on the forearms. It caught my interest enough that I grabbed several sizes and slowly made my way to the nearest fitting room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had guessed too large with many of my choices. The second to the last one was just about right. I laced it up and looked. It looked better than I had expected. Buoyed by a new sense of possibility I tied the arms of my flight suit around my waist as a make-shift belt and returned to the store. Slowly I began to appreciate the joys of shopping with someone. Claire was a good second opinion and it was fun to see what she was picking out as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time we finished we were laughing and having a great time. I had two tops and two skirts, giving me four combinations. Claire had found something she liked as well. Rather than wear the flight suit I changed into the longer black skirt with lace bottom panels and my first top selection. Buckle up heavy boots finished off the outfit nicely.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had several moments of panic as I stepped into the streets. After so many years of wearing pants the freedom and draftiness of the skirt was unnerving. It had seemed like the almost ankle length skirt would have been less terrifying than the shorter upper calf length pixie cut and slashed one. Now that I was actually in the street the pixie skirt with the grey leggings underneath might have been a better starting point. I tried not to let Claire see how twitchy and paranoid I suddenly became.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dinner? We could go somewhere other than the usual tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, is there something wicked around here?" I tried not to show my relief. I wasn't sure I felt ready to enter the Adam and Eve in my new look quite yet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, interesting, exceptional, fun?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh. Yes, there's this great Armenian cafe just down the block from here. Or there is a good pirogie kitchen a little farther down."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pirogie sound good. I haven't had them in a long time." I followed Claire the block and a half to the small shop. It was little more than an aisle next to a long case of samples. It reminded me of a similar shop on Broadway where a room mate and I had gone a few times. After selecting several for each of us we found a table on the street nearby. I settled into the chair closest to the buildings and forced myself to relax a little bit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We talked of easy things, Temple Heath, the Devil's Cathouse, food, and trains while we ate. When we were finished Claire asked, "Cathouse?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still feeling the fears crawling along my spine I replied, "I think I want to go back to my place for a few minutes first. I'd like to change my look a bit and drop off the rest of my stuff."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I left Claire in the sitting room staring out the window at the cathedral as I darted upstairs. I felt much better as soon as I had the leggings on. It looked like I would have to work up to the other skirt slowly. Slipping on the pixie skirt I hurried back down stairs. The urge to dance was building rapidly and I wanted to get going. "Do you want to leave your stuff here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, thanks. I live at the Cathouse. I'll just take it with me." Claire made a show of looking around. "Nice place you have here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I liked it when I found it," I smiled. "Ready?" I asked as I headed for the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In a hurry?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sort of. I need to dance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Need to?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Need to." It boiled and bubbled in chaotic waves beneath my skin. I didn't know how to explain, so I just kept walking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where did you learn? I've been taking lessons ever since I got here and I'm still not very good."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I just knew how to once I was here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh wow!" Adoration shone out of her eyes and scared me. I was only here a few days and already too many people were interested in me. I wanted to run back to my place, lock the doors, and never step out again. The screaming energy in my nerves cried out for the pounding music of the Cathouse. Claire hurried to keep up as I walked even faster.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside the club I almost ran for the dance floor, leaving Claire to make her way to her room by herself. The dance soothed the screaming rats scurrying around in my brain. Peace slowly settled back over me as the music slammed me around, spun patterns from my flesh, and drove me from myself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several sets later I slipped over to the bar. "Warrior woman, I approve of the new look." Ennui's smile was appreciation without pressure. "Morphine Drip and water?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes please." I smiled back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Conversation later?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't, but you looked a bit spooked when you dashed onto the floor. Like two nights ago kind of."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, still a lot on my mind. I need to dance for a while longer first. And I don't have to bother you if you'd rather I didn't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok. Come get me when you're ready."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Near midnight I was finally ready to talk. At least I was until I arrived at the bar and the Monk said, "Can I get you anything? By the way, Ennui said you can go up any time, if you still want to talk with her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Morphine Drip and water please." I sat and sipped the drink after slamming the water. When the test tube was empty I asked for a second one. I sipped it even more slowly than the first and wondered what I would really say to Ennui. I had so many questions, but was she even the one to ask? She had tried every time I had intruded, but how much longer could I keep bothering her. I stared at the second empty Morphine Drip, sighed, and slipped around the end of the bar. The Monk just nodded as I headed back into the private areas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly I climbed the stairs to the top floor. Outside Ennui's door I hesitated for a long time. I had started to turn away when Dementia came up the stairs. "Were you looking for Ennui? I think she's in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, no, I'm not really sure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia stared at me for a long time before saying, "You should come in." She opened the door and motioned for me to precede her. Slowly I walked in and stood nervously as she closed the door. Ennui was curled up in a large chair, reading a book. Dementia crossed to her and gave her a quick kiss. I turned away embarrassed and looked out the nearest window.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are troubled," Ennui began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Always," I replied bitterly. The chaos I had burned away dancing returned in full force. "I'm doing it again. Not even here a month and I'm doing it again." I had started pacing again. They waited silently for me to continue. "I don't want to be attached and I do. When I get attached to someone I hide myself to be what they want. Why do I do that?" Again they let the silence stretch out. Almost against my will I spoke to fill the void. "They won't like me if they know me. Knowledge is a weapon, every bit of me someone knows about is another weapon they can use against me. Better not to hand out weapons. Merris intrigues me, yet I didn't tell her I had been dancing here. We could have come over last night. Instead I tried to sleep, couldn't, and ended up dancing in my room anyway. When she asked about it I was so embarrassed to tell her. This drives me crazy, this shame over everything I do." Ennui drew breath to say something but stopped when Dementia shook her head. A twisted smile curled my lips when I continued, "I always try to attach to someone. That way I don't have to be as pro-active in what I do. But over time I start to resent them for that. It's not really their fault, but... the resentment is still there. Now comes Merris and I fear doing the same thing again. And Erick is interested, and now Claire, and the gods alone know who else. Why can't I stop talking? Why am I telling you all this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why don't you tell us?" Dementia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tried to stop talking then, but it twisted inside me until I had to blurt it out. "I'm so sick of hiding. I can't stand what I've been. I want to be more." The sudden rage thawed some of the ice. "I want to be..." The words died as I realized I was most of what I wanted to be. For the first time ever.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want to be?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Me," I answered with solid conviction. "I want to know what I am, who I am, whether there is anything left under all the masks I have assumed through my life. All my life I've hidden in the shadows. It was safe and comfortable. Here, here I can't hide anymore. I have become...things...done things, gotten... abilities...that are needed. I like to be needed. I don't want to be responsible and being needed means being responsible. I'll just screw it up and then where will everyone be? I don't want my actions to impact others and what I am now, well, it could impact so many."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You didn't have to go on that rescue. What prompted you to?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wanted some excitement. Then I didn't want to die. Then..." I stopped abruptly. not wanting to admit what I had told Bart.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something about that scared you, didn't it? Was it the danger? Was it that other people died?" Dementia asked. "Or did you enjoy it?" My shudder told her everything even as I tried to remain silent. "You enjoyed it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just like Bart the words clawed their own way out. "I didn't want to. There were screams, blood, and I dealt death, so much death..." Even now I could see the torn flesh and ichor on my hands, smell the horrible odors. Unbidden the killer slid forward to stare about the room. Ennui edged back in her chair but Dementia remained calm, watching me. "Yesss," It came out in a weird purr, "I enjoyed it. The ultimate dance, the dance of life and death. There is not one without the other. And I was so alive with it!" Terrified I scrambled back to the wall and slid down it, hands pressed hard into my eyes, trying to drive the beast back. "Ahhyyiii," escaped in a long shuddering gasp. "No, no...I don't want to be this...."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are scared you will be a killer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia's analytical words brought my head up. "I don't want to be a killer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You killed them to save us. It has always been this way. There is no shame in saving your friends." Ennui added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I enjoyed it!" I shrieked in agony. "I fucking enjoyed it and I want to do it again! It itches and crawls under my skin. The craving for that intensity of feeling."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you want to kill me? How about Ennui, or Bart, or the Temple Heath gang? Is there anyone in Eternia you want to attack right now?" Dementia pressed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Gods, no!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then maybe you are scared of the wrong things." Dementia finished. It wasn't much, but a small knot loosened a bit at her words. "You were touched by the Lady when you arrived. Were you like this in the Realms?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not really..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then might it not be a gift of hers? And if it is, might there not be a reason, a purpose? You said you wanted to be useful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You dance it away don't you?" Ennui asked. "The crazy energy?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With a thump the pieces fell into place. "Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then keep dancing." She said it as if it were the simplest thing in the world. "So many here haven't found an outlet for what eats at them. Allow yourself yours. You deserve it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui missed the twitch that caused but Dementia didn't. It drove me to my feet as the fear driven energy sizzled along raw nerves. I rose quickly and turned to go. "And dance I feel the need to do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia reached the door before I did. Her calm eyes held my wild ones with total immovability. "Running won't make it better. You deserve better than you allow yourself. Think about that as you drive yourself to exhaustion." She stepped aside and opened the door as terror propelled me into a run. I leapt almost from landing to landing as the headlong rush tumbled me down the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ear splitting and flesh pounding sound crashed into me as a ran onto the dance floor. Energy flew from me in shimmering sheets driving the rest of the club goers into a frenzy of motion only slightly slower than my own. The DJ picked up on it as well and kept the music hard and insistent for the next hour. Dancers dropped in droves until I was the last one still in motion when closing time neared.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the last song faded into silence I staggered to the bar and collapsed onto a stool. "Water, please," I croaked out when the Monk asked. Silently she handed me a pint glass and set a full pitcher next to it.</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">For a moment it looked like she was going to push harder, but something in my look must have dissuaded her. Instead she said, "You came here. That would be a start at doing something for yourself. Maybe this is the time for you to figure it out." Dementia asked. "Oh, and about Merris and relationships? You won't need to worry too much about loosing yourself in her. She is intrigued by you, that is obvious, but Merris first love is Dispatch. She won't throw over her first love for anyone. She won't move in with you and she won't take over your life for you. Even if you begged her." I relaxed as the topic turned away from me and back to safer ground.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Erick is a friend of mine, but I will be the first to say he's fickle. The next ass-kicker that comes near him and he is gone." Ennui added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Claire, Claire I don't know too well. She has done lighting for Love's Bitch, the house band here, and I've talked to her a bit, but I don't really know her. She works at Temple Heath doesn't she?" Dementia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She does. She seems nice enough. We went shopping today and I guess I kind of freaked when she came on to me a little. She's nice enough, it's just I don't want to settle into anything just yet. Yet I do, so I can retreat and hide...although I tend to spiral in on myself without external input. Living alone is at least as dangerous for me as living with someone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thought about a room mate? Seems that might be a better bet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It did work well for me in the Realms. Maybe, I don't know. If I found the right one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you need it, it will happen. That is how it works here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* add this section to Adventures */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I turned to Dementia after Kali had left. Will she be ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I believe she will. The Lady never selects anyone that is a danger to Eternia, so I must believe Kali is not as well. She won't have an easy time of it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You've seen her, haven't you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have. I've seen enough now to know she is one of the signs of a coming storm." She pulled me tight against her and whispered sadly, "I fear things are going to get so very much worse."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But they get better, don't they?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If Kali can keep herself together, it might." She pulled back slightly and stared at me. "Being a seer is both better and worse than not being one. Often you see enough to know what might be coming, which can give you a chance, but rarely enough to be very sure of the outcomes."</p>
