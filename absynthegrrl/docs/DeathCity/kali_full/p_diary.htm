<p class="pagecaption">Kali Personal Diary</p>

<p class="regtxt5">First off, I suck at these kinds of things. Once, long ago, a counsellor suggested I start a diary. Her thought was by writing down what I was thinking, I would somehow be better able to understand it. I think that try lasted two entries. Maybe this one will last longer. There is so much happening right now that I can barely keep up, and it shows no sign of slowing down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If you are reading this, it will be posthumously. I don't see myself ever sharing this with anyone while I'm alive to be embarrassed by it.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">After The Rescue - Eternia, Day 4</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was scared crazy when we started. Nothing had prepared me for any sort of combat and there I was, skulking through a ruined city, waiting to encounter an enemy. I hadn't thought it could get any worse, but when we found them fear froze me in place. I fired a couple of shots at the nearest ones, but only managed to attract their attention. Only some basic instinct saved me when one of them hit the weapon power unit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was about to curl up and prepare to die when Jemima went down. Rage boiled up inside me. Rage for the fear I felt every moment of my life. Rage at the bullies and tormenters that I'd never faced down. It flashed white hot through me, sizzling along nerves and throwing me back to watch myself become a perfect war machine. The mind would find a target and the body would deliver a perfect lethal blow, working together in a grace I had never possessed. I told everyone it scared me, what I did in that fight, but I didn't tell them how much I loved it. The freedom of unleashed fury on those that deserved it. No ambiguity, no grey area, just kill or die.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When it ended I felt different. What a simple statement, but at the time I didn't know what kind of different. It could have been residual adrenaline, or something else, but I didn't get a chance to figure it out. We were already on to the next crisis, getting the train out and defending against a second wave.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everything kept cascading in a series of nerve wracking events until I finally staggered back to my flat. Green ichor and bits of the creatures  clung to my hair, were ground into my clothes, and reeked with a wretched odor. I stepped into the shower, clothes and all. I slipped off the boiler suit and finally understood what felt different. The surges of energy had changed more than just my reflexes. I was no longer the fat, lumpy hybrid I had been in the Realms. In one chaotic series of events I had become one of the lucky ones that could look in a mirror and see a reflection that perfectly matched my internal self image.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A full hardware test revealed...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oh gods how I hate my background. The one that taught me anything related to sex was dirty and evil, that any pride in my appearance, abilities, or self was wrong and sinful. Why can't I just say I played with myself and achieved an awesome orgasm with my new body? Why can't I feel good saying what I see in the mirror is hot and perfectly matches how I want to be? Instead, even the stupid machine euphemisms feel dirty.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Okay, okay, wait a minute. This is a diary, it's supposed to be Personal for fuck sake and here I am writing like an observer, embarrassed by everything. I'm sitting in the window of my flat, sixty or so feet above the street, in a floppy T-shirt and nothing else, not really caring if someone looks up and sees something, because, gods damn it, I love my new look. No one is in the room watching me, no one can see what I'm writing from the street, and I'm writing in fucking observer mode. Maybe it's good this is a paper diary, otherwise I'd just delete that first part because it's just weird and fucked up. This way I almost have to leave it as a reminder this is a Personal Diary.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Okay, enough ranting for now. Where was I? Oh, right, ch-ch-ch-changes as the old Bowie song used to say.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The greatest change happened during my first time fighting, but there had been a few others before that. The first morning I woke up with bleary vision and realized I no longer needed my contacts to see. The next morning I woke up and didn't have a coughing fit either before or after eating.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Oh yeah, and I danced, I actually Danced, and didn't suck at it, like I had been so certain of in the realms. People stopped and watched, apparently I was doing that well. I'm blushing as I write this because I'm still terrified by attention. But it feels good too. I had sought to disconnect from the world through writing and reading in the realms, and it had somewhat worked, but it was nothing like the absolute peace and tranquility I felt once I had let the dance wash through me. My fear of attention wanted me to never do it again, but my craving for peace and quiet will make sure I do.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the time I thought those were the best, but they were only starters for what was to come. Sammi and Jemima took me to Portal Station, to see the sights, but while we were there a call came for people to help rescue a stranded recovery mission. That was the first time I heard about the war between the proxy gods and Eternia and the first time I went into battle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If I had known what it was really like, I might not have gone, instead, I eagerly agreed and found myself dropped off on a dead world with my two new friends. We were to find the trapped mission and get them out. It sounded so simple while we were on the surface, but they were in the old subways under us. Nerves hit once we were in the sewers, trying to make our way around a blockage. By the time we reached the other team I was scared crazy and shaking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had thought it couldn't get worse until we rounded the last corner and stared into the back of a wave of ugly grey things that were hurling rocks and magic at a group of people huddled near a train. Sammi and Jemima launched themselves right into the mess. I fired some shots from the back, hoping to hit something without having to get close. It worked for the first two shots, then a group split off and turned to rush me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A magic blast hit my weapon and instinct had me dropping the power pack and leaping behind a fallen section of ceiling before I knew it. Fear kept me frozen there until Jemima was knocked down. I remember running into the mass of enemies and lashing out with hands and feet. Bodies flew around me, flesh clotted under my nails, and I howled with a pure joy I have never felt. At the same time I watched in horror as my brain and body worked together as a flawless killing machine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the end I had taken down half the enemy by myself and everyone was congratulating me. Once the killing stopped, the savagery faded away and left me confused, shaking, and feeling odd. I didn't have any time to figure it out because the next disaster was on us. A second, stronger, wave of enemies was headed our way. If we didn't get the train running and away, none of us would walk out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thomas, the engineer from the mission, helped me get the locomotive patched together enough to get it moving. Again, something felt strange when I slipped in to work around the diesel engine and electronics, but still there was no time to ponder it. As soon as the locomotive was running Thomas insisted I drive back. He was afraid his broken arm would interfere and he promised to talk me through everything. Sitting at the controls felt different as well, like my clothes were bunched up differently.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time I reached Temple Heath and all the disasters were behind us I was too tired to worry about anything except getting home. I was covered in greenish grey goo, bits of flesh, and I stank. Once inside I spun the shower on and stepped in, clothes and all, hoping to rinse off the worst of the mess. I unzipped the boiler suit and shrugged it off my shoulders. The sports bra that had been tight on me in the morning hung loosely around me, too large in chest and cup size. I pushed the suit down and found my underwear fitting very differently than before.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It had happened, that magic transformation that all of us with identity issues pray for. In a single day I had morphed from some over-weight, lumpy hybrid into the gender of my dreams. I skinned out of everything, leapt out of the shower, and shoved the door closed. The mirror confirmed it. A long, lean dancer's body reflected back at me. I spent a long time twisting and turning, examining my reflection from every angle. My face was harder, sharper, with a strong narrow jaw, high cheek bones, and intense grey eyes. Not only had my prayers been answered, but I had been gifted with a self that perfectly matched my self image. It was there when I opened the door and closed it again, afraid I was dreaming.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly I dropped to the floor and sat facing the mirror, intending to explore the other changes more closely. Careful work with scissors and a razor solved the issue of curly hairs that wouldn't stay out of the way. My touches started out clinical and exploratory, examining the new parts. Soon, however, they turned into stroking and fondlings, leading to a mind shattering orgasm. I had tried to image how it would feel, what would be different, but wow, I hadn't imagined just how much better it would be!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once I was finished with the last of my shower, I towelled off and ran to the dance studio. I spun and danced for the mirrors, watching how this new me moved and flowed. I know it's a bit narcisistic, but I couldn't stop looking at myself and how all the new pieces fit together into a wonderful whole. Warmth flowed through my muscles and the slightly jerky, clumsy movements morphed into a grace and elegance as I spun and turned around the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I might have danced myself to exhaustion if the gong of the doorbell hadn't pulled me back. Bart's voice floated up the stairs, "Kali, hey, are you home?" I ran for the bedroom, slipping up the stairs just before Bart came into view.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm here. Coming, just a minute..." I called back, trying desperately not to sound out of breath. Panic clawed through me as I grabbed a large t-shirt and slipped it on. I stumbled down the stairs and skidded to a stop, back against the wall.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart's a great guy and I love having him as a friend, but when he came in last night, all I could feel was terror of what he would do, now that I was pretty. I think he would have hugged me, until he saw me flinch when he came too close. The pain only showed a tiny bit in his look before he moved back and sat quietly, waiting for me to settle down. The saddest thing is the hug would have felt wonderful about then. "How did you find me?" I pulled my arms across myself, then realized what that would show and quickly dropped them again. I backed quickly into the sitting room, held my shirt down as I dropped into the pillows, and frantically piled them up over me. Something cat-like stirred in the back of my mind and padded forward on silent claws. It poked at the fear, wondering why I should be afraid of the man in the chair. 'You could kill him easily,' it purred silently.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We talked. It sounds simple, but it wasn't. Everything had changed, he knew it and I knew it. I had thought I could stay in the shadows, like I had in the Realms, after all the changes. He pointed out that I was never in them. Not before the big change, and certainly not after. It wasn't my new looks that lost me the shadows though. It was the dancing I had done and the fighting. I had saved people in a spectacular way and there would be no way to pretend it hadn't happened.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I don't want to say I broke down in front of him, but I did. It scared me silly, the notice I wouldn't be able to avoid. Broke down, that might be too simple as well. I don't think I passed out, but it was damn close. I had friends who talked about panic attacks, suddenly I understood as blackness pushed in from the edges of my vision, intense dizziness spun the room around me, and a fist crushed my chest so I couldn't breath. Bart was wonderful, managing to talk me back slowly and calmly, until we could resume our talking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tried to explain how attention was never my friend. How any time I was noticed it was to be ridiculed or beaten down for any infraction of the ways my peers and parents thought I should be. I explained the rage and how much I feared it. Gods, the rage, it's always there, clawing away under my skin. I want to tear at them, the ones that made me feel this way. The ones that made me fear everything in life from the simple act of walking down the street to the mode complex tasks of school, shopping, and friends.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I think he understood some of it. And, to his credit, I don't think he came to fear me, even when the predator I had become in that battle stalked forward part way through. He calmly faced it until I could force it to retreat again. Or maybe it just retreated, the more I think about it today, the more certain I am that it made the choice, not me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart would have let me hide in my apratment. It was the sweetest thing he could have offered, and I was so tempted to take him up on it. The old me would have. The me that had faced down real monsters wouldn't let me, so we went to the Adam and Eve for food and drinks. Of course, going to the Adam and Eve was never quiet. The Temple Heath crowd was there and would have been hurt if their boss and their newest member ditched them for a separate table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I would have tried to stay in the background, but Bart, smiling evilly, announced me when we arrived. After that, the entire table was talking about the rescue and my part in it. I wish Sammi and Jemima had shown up. They were more the heroes of the hour than I was, at least I could have tried to make them such. I mostly did alright except when Erick pointed out how much I had done. I panicked and drew even more attention to myself. I would have run, but Bart and, surprisingly, Erick, wouldn't let me. Oddly enough, as the evening wore on, my discomfort actually lessened. Even the terror of being noticed faded a bit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">"I asked Jo at the Adam and Eve. She pointed me here. You still look like you're not doing too well. You sure you don't want to talk about it?" Bart slowly followed me into the room and sat in the recliner by the window. "This place changes everyone. Often not as quickly as you changed, but then you seem to have your own momentum here. Extreme things in the Void speed it up as well. It can be hard..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The word changes echoed in my mind, pushing the cat back and calling terror from the biggest change of all. Would I get periods? Could I get pregnant? Yuck! Turn into a bloated parasite carrier for some sperm shooter? At least my opinion of breeding hadn't changed. I couldn't think of anyone to ask and certainly no one I would want to have to explain everything to.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An icy fear of Bart crept into the terror. He had seen me in just my shirt. Worse, he would have noticed how good I looked. In an instant I knew the shadows were lost to me. I was hot and would be noticed. What if Bart thinks I'm attractive? I shivered at the thought.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali? Are you ok? Is there any way I can help?" I tried to answer, but all I could do was twitch my head from side to side in a series of twisting, jerking motions. "Kali?" Worry colored his voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Gods, what's happening to me? Look at me. This morning I was dumpy, ugly me and now, now I'm...oh gods." I almsot blurted it all out, but  I had gotten so tired of being Kali the trans-person instead of just Kali. Tears spilled over and traced silent tracks down my cheeks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You weren't ugly before, but you thought you were and you hid behind it didn't you? It let you avoid attention." I had thought the fear of Bart was bad enough, but when I realized I was no longer a shadow person, real panic set in. I relied on not being seen, not being noticed, and in one sentence Bart shredded that illusion. I don't think I passed out, but it was damn close. I had friends who talked about panic attacks, suddenly I understood as blackness pushed in from the edges of my vision, intense dizziness spun the room around me, and a fist crushed my chest so I couldn't breath. "Kali?" Bart tried again. He sat rigidly still in the chair, afraid to move at all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His stillness allowed me to grab enough control to finally get a small breath of air. I nodded slowly as the black spots faded slightly. "Attention was never my friend," I started to explain. "From little onward, I only got noticed for the things I did wrong. The shadows became my friends as I learned it was better to not be noticed. I don't want anyone attracted to me. I don't want to have to deal with it. I don't want it!" I forced myself to stop as my voice climbed into shrill shrieking..</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, shh, it's ok. It's really ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no, you don't..." I stopped again, not wanting to reveal anything. "It's not ok. Why did this happen? Big Joe said we look like we see ourselves. Why do I look like this? I didn't see myself this way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He only mentioned part of it. We think we're who and what we were in the Realms, but it isn't true. This place lets us be what we could have been. I bet somewhere inside you wanted to be athletic and you wanted to look good, but you couldn't let yourself. The Lady makes adjustments as well, things to help you heal or grow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What I could have been...gods, I..." my voice failed as the last few days overwhelmed me at last. "I don't know how to handle this. I was a shadow in the Realms. I just want to be a shadow. I want to be left alone," I croaked out in a faint voice. I had wanted this for every moment of my life. I had craved coherence, completeness, but I had always imagined nothing would change, I'd just feel good looking in the mirror. Realization was a cold twisting fear in my guts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry. I want to tell you that you can remain a shadow here, but I can't. You haven't been since you arrived. Jo told me of you dancing with Sammi and Jemima. You have already made a name for yourself by what you did today."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His words pulled my eyes up from the pillow I had been staring at. His eyes were sad and his face troubled at what he said. "What I did today. Oh gods...I did things, I've become things today..." the shredded bodies snapped into focus and the cat paced forward with them. 'Idiot child,' it chided, 'Why do you hide from yourself?' It lazily reached up a paw and swatted at my fear, shredding it with a stroke, and then it paced forward. "I killed, with my bare hands, and I fucking enjoyed it!" Hysteria tinged my triumphant confession. I fought back, wrestling for control and achieved a momentary balance of a form. "What's happening to me?" It came out more anguished than I had planned, drawing a sad look from Bart.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are changing, becoming..." Bart paused.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Becoming. Becoming what? I see the blood and flesh on my hands. But even worse I remember the pure joy I felt in ripping them to shreds with my hands." For a moment the mask slipped and I saw Bart almost flinch, but he caught himself and stared resolutely into my eyes as I continued, "I liked it Bart. That's the worst of it. I liked shredding those things, feeling the flesh tear under my claws. Even now part of me still likes it, wants to do it again. How can that be right? It's not anything right in any of the things I know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart spoke slowly, "I'll tell you something few know. In the Realms I was the class nerd. Everyone picked on me because I preferred to use my brain and I was a skinny little thing. I can't begin to describe the rage I felt every time I looked at my tormentors. When I arrived here I got a chance to see what it was like to be strong. It was a new chance but I had to learn what to do with that rage inside. Change always brings fear and uncertainty. Trust the Lady if you don't trust yourself. She thinks you belong here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A new chance..." I whispered. Suddenly I thought of Merris and her surprised look at Portal Station, "No wonder Merris looked at me funny when I came back. And I thought it was cuz I was covered in ick..." We laughed for long minutes and then I slipped back into a pensive silence. Bart sat and waited until I said, "I should try and get food I guess. Gods, what about everyone else? I don't know if I can see them right now. I feel so...fragile."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't have to. Do you have anything around here? I can make you something or go out and get us something..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wanted to slink into my room, close the door, and hide away forever. I had opened my mouth to tell Bart when the anger hit. It bubbled up from deep inside, rising in a flaming wind through the shattered mess that was me, and bursting behind my eyes in a brilliant flash. It was a firestorm of resentment and self loathing from years of letting my terrors rule. "I, need to try to go out. The fear is so seductive... If I don't try it'll be the Realms all over again. But they won't even know me, will they?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It'll be fine. I'll be right there with you. Everyone's used to seeing the newer people change. No one will think it unexpected."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll be right back. I should wear more than this..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">""I don't know, the pillows are quite fetching really."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Riiiight. Uh, could you close your eyes?" I dashed for the stairs as soon as his eyes were closed. The shapeless boiler suit calmed me a bit. I could hide everything in it except my face and, since I wasn't sterotypically pretty, I didn't feel too afraid. "Ok, guess I'm as ready as I will ever be."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">We went to the Adam and Eve for dinner once I had calmed down. I'm not sure why I was so nervous. Maybe everything seems less scary now that I have seen my new friends adjust to the new me without becoming monsters.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Last night I was barely holding it together as we walked to the bar. When the door opened and the sights and sounds of the crowd crashed over me I froze in place. Bart placed a hand on my shoulder and whispered calming words to me, which got me through the upper room, to the vault, and over to the Temple Heath table. I was almost calm until he announced the news of what I had done as way of introduction of my new form. If looks could kill Bart would have been a raging pillar of fire. I mumbled something to try and deflect the attention but another voice almost cut me off saying, "Not get in the way? We would have died there if it hadn't been for the three of you. Don't let her fool you she leapt into the fray like an avenging angel and single-handedly took out half the demon forces."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He thought I was a hero. I couldn't understand how someone could think that. It goaded words out of me I did'nt know I had. "It wasn't me. I wasn't in control. My gun jammed and I was terrified when they came at me. I lost it. I couldn't have stopped even if I'd wanted to." My voice rose in pitch and volume as I leapt to my feet almost shouting, "Don't you understand? I COULDN'T have stopped..." My shouting startled me into silence and I dropped back into my chair, trying to slide under the table while everyone else looked on in stunned silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart came to my rescue with a calm question of, "So, what are you drinking, Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Conversations slowly started back up after that and the original speaker, Erick, told me he refused to fear me, even if I feared myself. Things settled back into a routine until Bart looked up, noticed someone, and waved them over with a shout, "Merris. Merris, over here. Decided to come down from the mountains and join the rest of us for a bit?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hadn't paid much attention in dispatch when I had talked to Merris. I had been too exhausted and stressed to notice just how beautiful she was. She was dressed in a black leather jacket that looked like it had seen a few too many years. Underneath she was wearing a dark blue or black top. Worn black jeans and scuffed work boots completed the outfit. Her hair was still tousled and as I watched she reached up and ran a nervous hand through it before easing her way toward the table. As she drew closer I saw care lines worn into her face and I realized she wasn't as young as she had appeared. Her face was striking, oval, perfectly formed, and her smile was radiant. She ended up wedged between Erick and I once all the shifting of chairs was over. I had read porn in the realms and seen the phrase about instantly hot and wet. Now I got to experience it and the sudden tingling and warm dampness were things I'd never felt before. At least I was still attracted to women, I think it would have shattered me if I hadn't been.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stories were swapped around the table and the pints were kept full. Before I realized it, everyone was looking at me expectantly. Even more surprising, I hardly hesitated before telling the tale of the rescue. Afterwards, I felt better, realizing that I had done ok and that no one found fault with my momentary terror. Some of my fear and nervousness from my changed state fell away as well and as it did I realized how exhausted I was. I stood to leave and immediately sat back down again. I had lost track of how much I had to drink and it had caught up with a vengeance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you like a hand getting home?" Merris whispered to me. I nodded, not quite trusting my voice and she helped me stand. I swayed a bit until she placed a steadying hand on my arm. It was enough for me to walk almost normally back to my building. Her hand was warm and strong and I wanted it to...I wanted her to touch more than just my arm and I didn't want her to touch me at all. What I wanted and what I didn't want were exactly the same and a part of me was thinking, 'Great, puberty, round three.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, are you ok? What floor do you live on?" Merris asked when I came to a silent halt just inside the door of my building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Umm, top floor, but I can make it from here," I replied after a quick shake of my head to clear it. "Too much to drink," I moaned, to explain why I listed sideways and almost toppled into her. At least I wasn't quite to the full-on spins yet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm coming up with you," she announced. We made our way up to my place, stopping at every landing to catch our breaths and for the world to stop spinning, at least for me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe you could answer something for me?" I asked her, at one of our many stops.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's quite a few empty rooms in this building, yet there are people camped out in the alley behind here. Why haven't they moved in here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Eternia is a place of healing. Sometimes that healing is from bad things done in places like this. If your worst memories are from inside, maybe the street seems like a better place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn. Guess I didn't think of that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone finds the place they need to feel safe here." She paused and looked thoughtful before continuing, "For example I have bad memories from my bedroom, so I like places that don't remind me of it. Places like the couch in dispatch."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The couch in dispatch?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah - there's this green leather couch that I sleep on. Since I'm a workaholic anyway it saves a lot of time. I have an assigned room where I can wash up and change, but I can usually be found in Portal Station Dispatch." We finished the rest of the climb in silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once Merris was settled in a pile of pillows in the sitting room I got myself upstairs and to the bed. I was drunk enough that sleep took me before I could think about anything., but not so drunk I could ignore the strange feelings I was having after being with Merris. She was beautiful in a non-glamorous way, the way I prefer. Heavy black leather boots, dark work pants, cut tight enough to reveal a glorious ass, but loose enough to not show everything. Her top was low cut and showed very nice breasts. Wavy light blonde hair framed her face in a perpetual tangle since she would run her fingers through it when she was nervous. Her green eyes were warm and happy above a strong jaw. Just thinking about her gave me the screaming hornies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few moments were all it took to remedy that, but sleep still wouldn't come. </p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* should re-work this section - Kali is thinking about Merris the next night - remembering how hot she is and also remembering how she always latches on to a partner, never "playing the field" before settling with someone and then resenting her quick sublimating of her own self */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* the contact is confusing to Kali - she wants it to mean more than it probably does, and wants it to mean less than it could because of the new complications it would start */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">on sex - need sections like this throughout as she grow to enjoy it and want it</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I like sex with myself. I still feel somewhat dirty and weird for wanting it, but that doesn't stop me from having amazing orgasms with this body. Even better ones after I found the toy in my closet. I'm glad it was there since I'm not quite ready to go looking for one and I have no idea who I would feel comfortable enough to ask. The toy vibrates and slips inside, but it doesn't lick. Eventually, I will need to find someone to experiment with, but that can wait. There's still a bit too much crap in my head to want to go looking for that yet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">as part of this - explore the "mystical change" should fix everything myth - Kali is still the same person, with all the other issues, the only thing "fixed" is her physical shell</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">on dance</p>

<p class="regtxt5">wish i could have let myself dance in the realms - it is a wonderful release - bring in memories of "constructive criticism" and the inability to do anything right - see larger sections below</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">On Life</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Why are we so obsessed with the detritus of the past? So many stupid and hurtful things programmed into our culture about sex, relationships, clothing, modesty, and the rest. Why was it started? Was it just to control people? The monogamy thing I can almost understand since relationships can be really painful when someone is insecure about their place in them. But why all the taboos on sexuality? Clothing makes sense for protection, seduction, and fun, but why be so weird about nudity? And it is cultural. The area I came from was particularly fucked up with modesty. It was acceptable to show people being killed in awful ways, but completely wrong to show two people making love, or even naked for that matter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">on piercings</p>

<p class="regtxt5">need to show how the pain works for her and how she has always understood cutting</p>

<p class="regtxt5">on battle and the like</p>

<p class="regtxt5">make the battle functions a bit of jekyll-hyde - a bit separate in thought from her, she starts out by trying to keep it at a distance because it scares her so much. over time she begins to integrate it and rely on it for other things besides battle</p>

<p class="regtxt5">many of her team want to live, it sometimes holds them back, Kali doesn't care, almost actively seeking to die</p>

<p class="regtxt5">bring over some of the inner demons thoughts and salt them through-out</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petrov</p>

<p class="regtxt5">multiple sections for this - she starts thinking he's a loud-mouth, but he turns into her second, then into a very close friend</p>

<p class="regtxt5">write the indiscretion scene to be as hot and intense as possible - this effected her in many profound ways</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">also include a section on tattoos, piercing, cutting, and dance - she might have become a cutter or a piercer if she hadn't discovered dance first</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">dance class</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire took me to her dance class to introduce me to her instructor. On her recommendation I had on a more modest leotard and tights. The leotard was alright, but I didn't like the way the tights clung to and pulled against my movements. I kept pulling at them under my cargo pants, trying to get them to stop grabbing in sensitive spots.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The dance classes were held in the rooms over Freda's gym. I had never been in a real gym after I escaped from high school. This one looked like a cliche, straight out of the movies. It smelled of sweat, old socks, and slight mildew. Industrial lights spilled bright pools over equipment and shadows crouched in the corners. Sweating bodies moved through workout routines that were obviously well-practiced and automatic. Claire lead me past all this to a narrow stairway and up past fading ballet posters.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Upstairs was another large room, obviously a dance studio with mirrors and barres on the walls. She guided me around the edge, avoiding the few students already warming up, and into a small office. A Short, thin woman sat behind the desk, studying notes and diagrams. She looked up as our shadows fell across her work. "Claire, what can I do for you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jessi, I brought my friend Kali today. She would like to join one of your classes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jessi looked up and then stared at me for a few moments, "Do I know you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think so," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali dances at the Cathouse most nights and she's the stage dancer for Love's Bitch," Claire added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's where I've seen you. You're the one that stands out of the crowd. Where and what have you studied?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Studied? Um, electrical engineering..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, what styles of dance and who were your teachers?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"None and none, I'm afraid. The beginners class would probably be best for me. I don't know anything about dance, other than a few moves my body just knows how to do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want to get out of classes?" Jessi said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know how to do these moves to music, but I don't know what they're called and some of them don't feel quite right. I guess what I'd like to know is what the elements are, how to do them better, and how to know which ones to put together to make my performances better and more evocative."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here's what I would suggest then. I'd like you in all the classes. The beginner and intermediate will teach you proper body form and posture and the names of all the positions for legs and arms, basic steps and improve your technique and the advanced class will be focused on choreography, expression, and developing your style. Since this is your first exposure to dance classes there are a few things you should know. First, everyone watches everyone else but no one cares about you. If I see you exhibiting bad form, I'll correct you. In the absence of comment, understand that you are doing your movements correctly.. Bad form is the greatest contributor to dance injuries. The other thing is, some people take themselves much to seriously in these classes and they tend to target the better dancers when their egos are bruised. You need to be able to take the blunt and harsh in critiques," Jessi explained. "Now, I will give you an example of a typical review from an instructor or casting director, "Your moves are at a professional level, however, your form is sloppy and imprecise. Come back when you can demonstrate proper form."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">dancing</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wish I could have let myself dance in the realms. Had I known how perfect it was for disconnecting and recharging. In fairness, I was so tied down with shame and fear and expectations that doing anything to bring notice on myself was to be avoided. Thank you again parents for all the shit in my head. Of course being told you are stupid and clumsy doesn't help inspire any confidence in physical pursuits either. Fortunately, here, everything give the lie to clumsy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Now I know that one I am dancing, everything else drops away. I don't have to notice anyone watching what I do and thus, for those moments, I am finally free.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* transition into talking about battle and killing and Kali's pinging concepts about it */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I guess I should talk about the fighting. I am a killer. I don't know how to feel about it, though, and it scares me. All my life I've been afraid of what I could do. It started so long ago that I don't remember a time before it. My parents told me I was selfish, cruel, and cold and that no one would ever like me if I didn't learn to think of others. And, the sad thing was, there were enough things I did as a child that let them convince me. Every child is cruel sometimes, and I was no exception, yet nothing was ever said about any good things I may have done, only the bad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time I reached early school I already hated myself. My first experiences with others in my group taught me they were as loathsome as I. Now I know there were many that weren't, but, like me, they were unable to push back the truly despicable ones. I vividly remember wanting to kill many of them. As I grew, those feelings never stopped, although they were moderated by some wonderful friends I finally made.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The feelings never went away, though they retreated quite a ways until junior high. Someone pushed me on a day when I was already angry. The reaction was intense and terrifying in its intensity. I think I would have killed the person if a friend hadn't woken me up. I still don't know exactly what happened. When I came back, I had the person off the floor, pinned to the lockers by the hand I had around his throat. He was already turning reddish-blue. It freaked me out, but I had learned to show nothing so well that I don't think anyone else realized it. After that, no one picked on me again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had been scared of myself before that, now I was terrified. I dropped even further into the shadows, never wanting to be pushed to that point ever again. And I wasn't until I went on the first rescue mission. Once I started fighting it happened again. A thick red haze dropped between me and what I was doing. I was a weapon, deadly and effective, while I was locked in the back, watching my body kill.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At first I tried to fight against it, but stopped when I saw I would get myself hurt. After that, I tried not to watch, but that was just as dangerous. In the end, I let it wash through me and rode out the fight. I felt remorse, but exhilaration too. So many times in my past I had fled in fear of physical threats, fearing I would be hurt or killed. In this first battle I learned I was dangerous and capable. I could kill if I had to and I could keep myself from being hurt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And I am a killer, and I like it. Life and death, two sides of the dance. One is impossible without the other. I'm not sure yet whether I like the killing itself, or I like knowing I can if I have to. So far I have only fought demon-like things. I suspect it won't be this simple if we face people in battle. No one knows what to expect with the breaking of the Truce. Will the proxy gods try to bring their believers into the fight? What will it mean if they do, and is it ok to kill them? Welcome to the grey area of the real, just like in the realms. But I am borrowing trouble. I will wait until it happens before falling to the indecision. Well, it sounds good on this page, anyway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">sex - after the first time</p>

<p class="regtxt5">parent's words bubble up, all the admonitions and guilts - drive them back by reveling in it, by embracing the "badness" of loving it, wanting it, craving it - if it feels like it is pissing on the crap they fed her, it will make Kali relish it all the more</p>

<p class="regtxt5">one thing Kali doesn't really want or understand would be BDSM - pain just makes her mad in that context, humiliation makes her dangerous, and hurting someone for fun just isn't something she can bring herself to do, partly from not trusting herself to be gentle enough and partly because it just seriously creeps her out to inflict pain on those she likes</p>

<p class="regtxt5">some things are hard for her at first - particularly oral sex with boys - mostly from lots of baggage - Petrov is the first one she does where she enjoys doing it as much as he enjoys reciening it</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* add confusion over Petrov, add conversation with Merris about it, her, love, etc. - Merris will never commit and Merris knows this about herself - she is fine if Kali finds additional love with another - tells Kali she uses her head too much and her heart not enough, that her heart can love more than one person and her head needs to step back from it */</p>
