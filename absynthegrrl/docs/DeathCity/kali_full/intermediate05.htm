<p class="pagecaption">Intermediate 5</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* first time the team fights minions of the proxy gods that look like them */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Kali and Petrov had managed to stay apart until this event, they connect again and will remain partners until Kali's end */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need to sort out how Merris/Kali/Petrov works - determine if Kali is the only one to have troubble with a three-way relationship or if it effects all of them */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali was staring out the window of the command car. The void slipped silently past her empty gaze. She raised the bottle of slivovitz she clutched in her left hand to her lips and gulped down a large swallow. The face of the first proxy victim swam in her vision, as if mirrored in the glass of the window. The scene was vivid in her mind, the horde of men and women charging at her team, the shock on the team's faces, her barked commands to attack, and the crumpling form of the woman as she had slashed her throat out. Her right hand traced where the blood had spattered her face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali?" She flinched at Petrov's voice, then turned to see him enter from the next car. "You never served in the military or saw combat, did you?" He saw her face harden and the breath she drew to speak. He cut her off with, "You are a brilliant commander and your grasp of tactics and strategy is mystical. You have saved us from so many things with your skills, but fighting others of your own kind is different. It changes you. Some people can handle it, others die because they cannot. You have to find a way to deal with it or it will consume you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I still see her face," Kali whispered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petrov moved closer to her, hesitated, then reached out and offered her his arms. She stood frozen for a long moment, then let him enfold her. "You will, for a while anyway. It will fade as you adjust."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His scent shot fire through her, bringing surging lust with it and forcing a small whimper from her before she could clamp down on herself. His eyes bored into hers for a moment, then he dropped a hand to grab her ass as he lowed his lips to hers in a hungry kiss. He broke free just long enough to whisper, "Celebrate life. It's a way to cope."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she wants it hard from him - "Fuck me like there's no tomorrow!" */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* afterwards they talk about the first kill */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Does it ever get better?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The intensity fades, but if it gets easier, then you worry. The people I know who aren't bothered became or started as sociopaths, and that never ends well. My first one is still prominent in my memory. It was my first tour in a police action, a pretty euphamism for a war that we weren't officially fighting. This kid, eighteen at the most, came at me from an alley as my patrol was passing. I spun, shot, and hollered at my team as the grenade he had been holding rolled free. If his body hadn't landed on it, we wouldn't be having this talk." His words were casual, but his face looked old as he spoke. "I see that kid's face every time I sleep after combat." Kali pulled tight against him, holding herself pressed hard aganst him until her arms started to shake with fatigue.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she will also talk to Alice after this confrontation - taking her the necklace worn by the woman she killed for analysis - need to figure out who points her at Alice */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* still need to figure out how Merris plays into all of this */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she will really rely on Enui and Dementia for advice and support as she tries to come to terms with her dual attracions and the situation in general */</p>
