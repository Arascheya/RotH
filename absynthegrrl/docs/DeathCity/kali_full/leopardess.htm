<p class="regtxt5">/* building Leopardess (K666) */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Additional Notes</p>
<p class="regtxt9">She worked with a fabrication facility in the city. One of the people she met often went to the Dans Macabre. She and Kali started hanging with each other whenever Kali had to check on various items for Leopardess. Need to determine if this woman was in charge or just part of the team working on her parts. The facility is a large foundry and forging facility that provides metal items for many uses in Eternia.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Rainy is her contact. she is about Kali's age and a well muscled. In her time away from the plant she enjoys creating iron work sculpture and ornate work. At the plant she is the head pattern maker. She works closely with Kali on Leopardess to get the various pieces right. She also works closely with her when the need arises for 2 more units.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">pouring over plans, working with Rainy and Ron at the metal works, traveling between Death City and the city, remember Temple Heath probably has the old plan drawers full of blue prints for the various engines in the fleet. in a back section would be copies of recovered ones for various things they may not actually have but want to keep anyway. Kali will search through this, then return to the Realms for more. She will produce her plans in AutoCAD and plot them, then take them to the city for creation. eventually she might be able to upgrade the metal works to CAD based systems as an addition to paper plans. could have the mystery woman help out, but only via computer and IM.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart cleared out a small storage area near the documents and plans room. the desk was soon littered with books, papers and plans. steam tables were open in one book, another had steel alloy properties. old Baldwin prints and newly created drawings were scattered on every flat surface. in the center of the desk was a large monitor and a digitizing pad. immediately at hand was a stained coffee cup leaving rings on whatever it touched. kali stared into the screen while chewing the end of a small plastic brush.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's wrong?" Bart asked as he added thick warm coffee like sludge to the cold mass already in the cup.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"thanks," Kali answered distractedly. At last she looked up, ran a hand through her hair in a very Merris like gesture and said, "It's these damn materials tables. i can't find anything that will get me the boiler pressures i want at the weight i want."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why don't you take a break? we're headed for food and drink."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">kali stared into the screen for a few minutes longer, leaned back, and said, "Sure, yeah..." Suddenly decisive, she stood abruptly and headed toward the door. as they stepped into the night she continued her thoughts, "The most confusing is I don't know whether to redesign everything or restore what's there. there're been so many improvements in boiler and steam technologies since steam locomotives were built. and then there's all the electronic monitoring and controls that could be used to help out. i suppose i could just satisfy myself with a diesel electric and call it good, it's just they aren't nearly as cool looking."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"i want the coolness of the brute force ugly beauty of a steam locomotive. yet the engineer in me wants something efficient and non-polluting. Steam locos were horribly messy and inefficient but they still had a raw beauty that got lost in the transition to diesel and electric technologies."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing says you can't redesign, just it will be much harder. whether you restore or create new the facilities to build the big pieces will have to be set up. i know of a metal working facility in the city, but they only have shops for small things. the biggest they can really handle is replacement track and such. they might be able to ramp up, they are in an industrial section where there would be room for bigger shops."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">they were still discussing it as they made their way to the Temple Heath table. Neither of them saw the mystery woman look up as they passed. a few minutes later she closed her laptop and slipped into the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the next day when kali had a few minutes she headed to her room again. centered on the tablet was an open book with a pencil line under an entry in a another table. scrawled in the margin was, "welded, not riveted". to the side was a cd-rom with "boilercad - new version" scrawled on it in black marker. kali stared at the table, then her fingers flew over the keyboard as she installed the new software. quickly she made changes in various entries and ran her simulation routines again. she had her pressures with a good safety margin besides. puzzled, she walked back into the main area. "Bart, who's been in my office today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No idea, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"someone left me the answer to yesterday's problem... i wanted to thank them..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">She worked on K666 every spare minute, sometimes until she was fainting from fatigue. Blood from skinned knuckles found its way into grease and paint, sweat dropped into wax and finishes, bits of torn skin and hair were riveted into metal plating. All the while the reborn locomotive took shape. She poured over plans, huddled in conversation with Bart and others about insulating materials, bearings, alloys, and all the various pieces and parts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After seven months K666 sat in bay 6 gleaming a glossy black. Brass work threw golden sparks in the light and every piston gleamed. For long moments she stared at her locomotive, for hers it was, born of her will. Slowly she approached the cab and climbed up in. Carefully she worked her way through the steps of starting the great beast. K666 awoke slowly as the heat in her boiler grew. Metal crackled and sang as newly machined and fitted parts were heated for the first time. Intently Kali watched the monitoring equipment she had custom designed, noticing cold spots in the boiler and watching steam pressure and water levels. She made quick notes on a pad for relocation of burner nozzles to even things out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At last the steam and brake pressures were correct and everything was ready. Bart stood grinning at the side of the doors he had just opened. Kali gently eased the regulator open. Like a great beast K666 gave a shudder and slowly clawed her way forward. A touch more on the regulator and she eased forward more quickly. The pulse of the steam throbbed through Kali’s head like the beating of a giant heart. A fierce grin split her face as she hauled on the whistle cord. K666 responded with a howl like a restless soul unchained. With cat like grace she stalked into the morning. Sunlight flashed off the insignia painted on the cab, one symbol for Temple Heath Yards and another for the Death City Rail Road. When it splashed onto the tender the springing snow leopard painted there seemed to come to life and ripple in the daylight.</p>
