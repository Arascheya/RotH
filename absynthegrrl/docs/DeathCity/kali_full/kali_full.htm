<p class="pagecaption">Dreaming in Death City</p>
<p class="pagecaption">part - Arrival</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It had been another bad day at work. Kali had arrived late as usual, only this time the boss was watching. With a shake of his head he had escorted her to his office where he had given her an official warning about continuous lateness. At the end he had presented the papers for her to sign. Bold on the top were the words "First Warning". As she was leaving his office he added, "By the way, lose the cape. You're too old to be playing goth dress-up. It's not professional." She bit back a reply but couldn't stop the cold dagger stare as she turned to leave. Behind her he leaned back in his chair and grinned at her stiff posture.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stalked to her desk in the basement shop and set about the meaningless tasks that filled her days. A little surfing of the internet and programming of the work flow system that no one would ever use. By the time she was ready to leave the watery sunshine had turned to a cold Seattle drizzle. She climbed slowly onto the bus, grateful for the unprofessional cloak that had kept her mostly dry.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bus was packed full of soggy bodies by the time it reached Broadway. She had to push and thread her way to the nearest door and yell for the driver to open it again. She stepped out into the crowds and bustle of the brightly lit street. Neon flashed and pulsed, the overhead cables snapped and popped as other buses crawled along the street. Voices were raised in shouts of greeting and conversations as she tried to find space on the sidewalks to move. Carefully she eased her way through the throng to her favorite East Indian restaurant. She settled into a booth near the door, one of the few still empty, and placed her order. She had just leaned back to relax when the door opened again. She glanced up in time to see her ex-partner Anne entering with her new boyfriend.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They were laughing and carrying on like they had been together for months instead of a couple of weeks. As they walked by Anne turned to him and said in a loud whisper, "There she is. God, I can't believe I stayed with that depressed psycho chick as long as I did. And that's not the worst of it, let me tell you..." As they walked away Kali dropped enough money for her order plus a healthy tip and fled back into the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For once she was grateful for the rain. It gave her an excuse to pull the hood up on her cloak as she slipped into the shadows of the nearest alley. Eyes burning with unshed tears she slipped through the dark to the next street back, away from the lights and crowds of Broadway. Head bowed from more than the ever present drizzle, she shuffled along thinking of the last few days. With a heavy sigh she slipped back onto Broadway to walk past the stairway to nowhere, the last remains of a long demolished building. Just visible through the now stronger rain, it curved up to Harvard Street and then swept up to the missing building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It tugged at her like a half remembered dream and slowed her footsteps. Her gaze was so focused on the shadowed bulk of the stairs that she almost didn't see one of the chains holding the fence together was gone. Spurred by her depressed not caring she shoved and pulled the fence sections apart enough to squeeze through. Slowly she climbed the rotting concrete steps until she stood at the top where the building should have been.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rain dripped slowly from her cloak as she stared into the darkness as if waiting for the building to materialize in front of her. For a flickering moment she thought she saw it shimmering in the shadows, then it was gone. A faint popping sound intruded on her awareness and twitched her head toward Broadway. Nothing seemed out of place.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned to look at Harvard Street. A spill of warm yellow light pulled her gaze to an old trolley parked nearby. Curios, she slowly walked to the fence on Harvard and pushed her way through the gap she found there. The trolley was old, boxy, with a raised section in the center of the roof for ventilation. It was made of black painted wood, with domed glass widows, and it sat on railroad wheels instead of tires. She carefully approached the trolley looking for markings or signs. Near the door was an elegant insignia with "DCM-Eternia" blazoned on it. She was about to turn away when the doors opened and a voice called out, "A cold, wet night out, isn't it lady?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That it is," she replied, peering in at the driver. He was dressed in a worn long tailed coat and black top hat that would have looked more at home in a horse cab than the trolley. "What insignia is this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Death City Metro, lady. Don't ye remember? Ye requested a ride on the Death City Metro. I am here to offer it to ye."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She froze as her mind shut off for long moments. "That...that was just..." She stopped and sucked in a deep breath and thought again of the endless tomorrows stretching off into boredom. For long moments she hesitated, trapped by fear of the unknown, then with a shake of her head she decided. "Wicked!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh no lady, we be not wicked. Death City be neutral in the Proxy Wars."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, um..." Kali groped around for an appropriate exclamation and finally gave up. "I'm just very glad to see you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She moved to step aboard only to stop as he said, "That be not good enough, lady. Ye must answer yeah or nay."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The words came to her from somewhere deep in the past, from dreams and stories. "I enter freely and of my own will." The words hung in the air for a moment, ancient and powerful.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then enter and be welcome aboard the Death City Metro, lady..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali," she replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome Kali and Blessed Be." The exchange had the feel of a spell or ritual because once it was done he reverted back to the friendly trolley driver. "Take a seat anywhere ye like. The ride be a bit rough at first when we be leavin' the Realms." As he spoke he set the tram in motion. Within moments it lifted from the street and climbed into the clouds. Kali watched spell-bound as Seattle faded into the distance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She sat back in the worn high backed leather seat and wondered what was happening. Part of her expected to wake shortly and find herself huddled on the stairs to nowhere. Another part fervently prayed this was really happening. Thoughts zipped through her head as she remembered the emails to her friend Jack about the stories he had written. In one of his latest he had asked if she had wanted to take a trip to Death City. "No, this can't be..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It slipped out quietly but the coachman heard it anyway. "What was that, Lady Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ummm...nothing..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sammi and Jemima asked that someone come for ye. They said a friend told them ye'd be wantin' te visit. Now settle back, we've a bit of journey left. It'll be about an hour to the Portal and then another two hours from the Portal to the city. Ye can ask after it at the Adam n' Eve. Ye be expected."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She expected to stay wide awake with thoughts bouncing around her head. Instead she felt her eyes drift closed and she faded into sleep moments later.</p>

</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The driver's voice slowly called her back awake, "We have arrived Lady Kali." Outside the tram wrought iron gas lamps lit a wide street. A sweep of cobbled path swept from the street to the brooding dark doors of a large cathedral. A smaller stone path lead off to the right side. "Welcome to Death City, the capital of Eternia. They be waiting for ye at the Adam and Eve pub. Follow the path around the edge of the cathedral and ye’ll find it soon enough. Tell the landlord’s daughter yer a friend of Jemima." Still she hesitated until he said again, "Go on lady, they're expecting ye."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Carefully she climbed down into the rainy night. A steady drizzle kept her company as she slowly walked down the path. At least some things were familiar. The pub was right where the driver had said. A pool of gaslight illuminated the worn oak door and the sign hanging above. Age darkened brick work formed the bulk of the building. Warm light spilled from the windows casting pools on the outside tables and herb gardens near the entry.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stood in the shadows for long moments staring at the building. Finally she shrugged, gathered her courage and strode to the door. She pulled it open onto a warm, cheery but tiny common room with a large fire burning at one end. Conversations washed over her as she stared in at the crowd. Tables were pushed together randomly to fill the available space. A thin, blonde server wove her way skillfully through the crowded chaos, leaving food and beer while efficiently removing the empties.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cautiously she stepped in and let the door close. Moving carefully she tried to thread her way to the imposing bar directly in front of her and the giant holding forth from behind it. She was making headway when a tangle of flying skirts and a happy voice interrupted her progress.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali! It is you, isn't it? We knew you were coming. I'm so glad to meet you! Come on, let me get you a place and something to drink. I'll put you at Sammi and Jemima's table. Follow me. It's down in the vault." Immediately the girl was winding her way through the crowd with practiced ease. Kali followed her through another common room to a spiral stairway of brick leading down to an enormous brick chamber below the inn. Thick Columns arched up to support the building above. Gas lights painted flickering shadows around the room, and a huge fireplace idled along with a fire just large enough to keep the room comfortable. Soon she had Kali planted at a small table to the side of the large hearth. "Don't worry as a friend of Sammi and Jemima it’s ok to be at their table. I'm Josephine by the way, but everyone calls me Jo. Big Joe, my da, is behind the bar. What can I get you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali, still stunned by it all, answered hesitantly, "Something dark..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dark?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Umm dark and heavy. You know, something you could walk on and not leave tracks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Got it! One Murphy’s Imperial coming up." Jo skittered away in another flurry of skirts leaving Kali staring bemusedly into the room. A few minutes later she was back with a mug of beer and a small plate of bread and cheese. "Here, and I brought food in case you're hungry." She perched on the other chair before continuing, "Now, I'm sure you have questions..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, but the first is easy, how do I settle up for the beer?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't worry about settling up. Sammi asked us to take care of you, said the Realms hadn't been kind to you of late. They'll be here tomorrow night and apologize for not being here. They had to make an emergency run and all. There’s a bed upstairs. When you're ready just grab me and I'll take you up. You can get food here in the morning. Now I need to get back to it. If you need anything just wave me over..." With a smile she was gone back into the crowd.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali sat back in the comfortable chair and sipped the thick, rich, dark liquid, full of hidden flavor and the subtle hints of an ageless tradition of brew making. Thoughts whirled around in confusion. Thoughts of where she had come from, questions of how she had arrived, and questions about what to do next. Should she be angry or frightened by the taking of her? As she sat and sipped stout she decided not. Nothing had been holding her to Seattle and she had always wanted an adventure. Besides, the final choice had been hers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shaking her head to clear it she raised a hand and waved Jo over. She raised her mug and looked at it longingly before smiling. "Another coming right up." Jo answered her silent plea.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Got a moment?" Kali asked as Jo spun the new mug onto the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure. You want to know how it all works and how you got here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes...?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It’s the most asked of course. This place exists outside the Realms. It is our commission to rescue the beauty and art of the places in the Realms when destruction threatens it. That’s the easy part. None of us know exactly how we are chosen and transported to here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shhh, it is not asked nor is it answered except among close friends. The Lady determines and selects, that's all any really know of it. How’s the beer and food? You doing ok otherwise? Sammi and Jemima can maybe fill in a little more for you tomorrow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was thinking I'd finish this drink and free up the table."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Take your time. There are a few tables in here that are always waiting for certain people. This is one. The large group in the center is for the Temple Heath crowd. They're here every night, as are the Central Station people over there." She waved first to a loud happy group in the center of the room and then to a smaller group across from them. "This table is always here for Sammi, Jemima, and now you if you'd like." Jo stood and returned to the bar while Kali looked around the room again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She slowly finished her second stout then motioned Jo over again. "I think I'd like to fall into that bed now, if you don't mind..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, follow me." Once again Jo threaded them through the pressing the common room, stopping to chat with this or that person along the way. At last she guided Kali through an almost hidden door in one of the support columns. She led the way up the narrow spiral stair inside, down a short hall, pointing to a door and saying, "Washroom," then stopping in front of another door a little farther on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside was a small room tucked in under the eaves. Lacy curtains covered a small window and a fire burned in the grate chasing the chill from the room. A large bed sat below the window with its covers turned back. "Sleep well Kali. I'll see you in the morning."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The morning sun roused her as it spilled in through the curtains. Blinking sleepily she tried to remember where she was. It came back to her as she pulled the curtains aside to see a small garden below. Smiling she slipped out of bed and prepared to face the day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She had expected the pub to be empty, instead most of the tables were filled with people eating. She ended up back at Sammi and Jemima's table in the vault. A server approached soon after she was seated with a menu and water. She ordered and watched the vault rapidly fill with people as she ate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fortified by a hearty pub style breakfast she stepped out into the early morning sunshine. The cathedral drew her eye as the morning light rendered it even more beautiful. She stood for long moments admiring it. Reluctantly she turned away and made her way to the street. She began to walk, drawn by something she couldn't identify. As she walked she realized how quiet the city was. Bird song, bicycle bells, and scraps of conversation drifted past her. There were no automobile sounds or smells and she didn't see any parking lots crowding up against the cathedral.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just past the cathedral, on the inland side of the street, she saw a dark, brooding building crouching at the point of a triangular block. Her gaze was drawn by the heavy stonework and intricate carvings on its face.  A small sward of overgrown grass lay between the street and the doors. A cracked walkway cut through the grass, leading from the street to the closed doors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Curiosity pulled her up the broken and twisted walk to the yellow tape spider-webbed across the carved wooden doors. She could still make out the faded black letters of, "Crime Scene - Do Not Cross". Large brass lion handles glowered at her from behind the tape and stone gargoyles stared down from the roof above. Quiet waiting oozed from the building both pulling and repelling her. She slowly reached through the tape and pulled the left door. It squealed open on rusty hinges. Hesitantly she entered, almost as if the building had to reach out and drag her in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dusty colored light fell from a stained glass window high overhead illuminating a circle of orange cones with more yellow tape. Other pools fell on the wide stone stairwell clinging to the walls of the open circular atrium. The hand of the building pulled her more strongly now. She walked to the steps and began climbing. By the time she reached the top she was almost running. She skidded into the fourth floor hallway and stopped confused.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Higher, she had to get higher. Searching she finally found the small oak door with a rose covered ankh carved into it. It opened to a narrow, circular, wrought iron stairway that drew her higher. Scrambling, almost falling in her haste she clawed her way up and into an ante-room. To her left was a circular room almost completely covered in windows. In front of her was an open space and then another wrought iron circular staircase rising to a higher floor. To her right was a hall leading off in two directions and a door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The view of the cathedral drew her into the circular room. Brightly colored throw pillows covered most of the rich Oriental rug centered in the room. Near the edges she could just see the hardwood floor underneath. A large, deep easy chair was pulled up to the windows and placed so it had a perfect view of the cathedral. An ornate chandelier hung over it with its wicks ready for the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still the need to go higher pulled her back to the stairs. They emerged into a round tower room, above the rest of the roof line and completely surrounded in windows. A huge four poster bed dominated the room, it’s blood red velvet curtains drawn back to reveal the black bed spread with a single red rose embroidered on it. It’s uprights and crosspieces were intricately woven wrought iron traceries. Lace curtains framed the windows while thicker ones brooded between them, waiting to close out the light, or hold it in at night. Toward the back of the building were  patio doors leading out onto a small balcony.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A teak wardrobe stood to the side of the stairs and a large trunk crouched at the foot of the bed. The cavern of the wardrobe barely noticed the meager stock of clothing within. A black cat suit hung next to three dark green flight suits, two pairs of jeans, and a couple of folded t shirts rested on the shelf. A worn pair of motorcycle boots with metal shin guards stood propped in a corner.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The trunk was also nearly empty, holding only a small oilskin pouch with a well crafted set of lock picking tools, a coil of climbing rope and a small bag of pitons with a hammer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The patio doors opened onto a small balcony that overlooked the roof line of the building. It looked down on a triangular section of roof that had been made into a garden. One either side were doors into the wings of the building that attached to the lower circular room she had just left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The need to explore the rest of the area dragged her away from the views and back down to the hallway. Halls led off to the left and the right. The door swung open to reveal a sky lit bathroom with an enormous claw footed tub. Ivy wove itself around the windows above the tub and up to a latticework near the skylight. She could just make out the railing of the balcony above through the twined leaves. A thick forest green throw rug masked the orange, red, and brown tile of the floor. Under the dust, fluffy purple towels hung expectantly on a brass rail, waiting invitingly for the next bather. Beyond the window was the roof garden. Bright flowers bloomed in the early morning light and a small fountain played in the center of an open area.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Turning back to the passageways she turned left and rounded a corner. The left wall was a series of windows looking out into the garden area and part way down on the right was another door. She stopped and opened it. Across from her were more windows. Mirrors lined the other three walls and a waist high brass rail encircled the room. A small stereo stood on a wheeled stand in the left corner near the windows. An impulse moved through her and soon she was half dancing, half just moving around the room. Small clouds of dust puffed up from her feet as she slowly warmed up. Somehow her muscles knew how to move, far better than they ever had before. Even the stiffness in her left shoulder was less noticeable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once her glance fell across herself in the mirror and she cringed at her reflection. She hadn't realized just how much weight she'd gained over the last year. The pudgy baby face her mom had given her was even more noticeable than it had been. So was the added thickness around her middle. Just like her mom she stacked it on in her stomach rather than her hips and thighs. Quickly she turned so she was looking out the windows as she moved.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took a while before curiosity pulled her out of movement and to the door at the end of the hall. Beyond it was a large study with an oak partners desk holding court in the room. The wall to her right was covered in bookshelves. The other three walls alternated between more shelves and windows revealing the garden, the back street, and the side street. The buildings beyond were slightly lower than the one she was in and showed jagged roof lines and intriguing oddities of angle. On the desk was a computer and keyboard. There was a door near the one she entered through that led to the garden.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She crossed to it and stepped into the garden area. She wandered among the plants for a while, marveling at how healthy they were even though they showed signs of neglect. Someone had put a lot of work into the arrangement and taken good care of them. There was another door, almost directly across from the study, that opened into a cavernous kitchen. A large brass rack hung from the ceiling in the center of the room supporting trailing ivy and large kitchen utensils. Beneath the rack was a butcher-block central island with a knife rack mounted on the side. An industrial size gas stove dominated the wall to her right and was backed by windows facing the road behind the building. On the wall to her left was an enormous icebox standing next to a door. On it was a poster of a ballet dancer in mid movement and the phrase, "Eat Right, Respect Your Body, Dance Forever". The door opened onto a hallway leading back into the rest of the apartment. It passed an empty room and emerged on the other side of the bathroom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Normally she would tell everyone she wasn't the cleaning type, in fact she'd sum herself up as ‘domestically impaired’, but there she was, scrubbing that place for all she was worth. She couldn't have told anyone why, it was more of a compulsion than anything else. Most of the day passed as she swept, scrubbed, dusted, and straightened. At last she collapsed on the pillows in the living area.</p>

</br>
<p class="regtxt5">It was dark when hunger woke her. Only a few lights were visible from her windows, along with the glow of Central Station in the distance. A feature of the city she remembered from John’s descriptions. She prepared herself for a long, groping descent through the dark stairwells of the building, but when she stepped back into the gloom it seemed less dark than it should have been. In no time at all she had reached the street and had turned her steps toward the Adam and Eve and food.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jo guided her to the table near the fire then returned with a huge plate of food and a Murphy’s Imperial. As Jo turned to go Kali asked her how she could find out who owned a place, blushing all the while. "Why, did you find something you like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nodding excitedly she replied, "There’s this wonderful place near the cathedral, but it looks like no one has been there in a very long time. I'd like to find the landlord, or someone who could tell me more about it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Big Joe knows the most about the places around here. I'll send him over in just a bit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Soon Big Joe wandered over and settled in. "You're going to stay then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh..." His question caught her off guard. "I, yeah, I thought I'd stay. I guess, I mean, do I have to go back? I hoped I could stay."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could, yes," A strange look flickered across his face so fast she wasn't sure she actually saw it. "As Sammi explained it to us, you were given a chance to visit. You are free to go back any time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Panic clawed its way up her throat as she thought again of her boring endless future in the Realms. "Do I have to go back? Could I stay and see if I like it here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Certainly you can stay. The Lady won't turn you away, else she wouldn't have let you come in the first place. Now I hear you've been out looking for a place. What’s the matter? Isn't our hospitality good enough for you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She started and stuttered until she saw the twinkle in his eye and the grin spreading over his face. "Umm, it’s wonderful...it’s just...well, I've seen this place that’s even more wonderful, it’s perfect, and I'd like to know who owns it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And were is this ‘dream spot’?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In the building by the cathedral, the one with the police tape..." she slowed to a stop as she saw his face grow thoughtful.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't believe I know that one. Were is it again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It’s right across from the cathedral, just down the street from here. It’s not hard to spot, it’s the tallest building around except for the cathedral."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you describe it for me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She began to try and describe it in words, "triangular, sort of, it fills the lot between the two roads leading away from the cathedral, beautiful gothic stonework surrounds the main entry foyer, which is in the point of the triangle. Inside is a large entry area with a circular stairwell going up and stained glass windows throwing rich colors on old marble..." she paused, trying to conjure up the picture of it in her head.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Joe watched her with a strange look as she struggled for the words. "What did you do before you came here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Huh, what?" Concentration broken she stared at him. "Why?" Puzzled by his intense and serious look she started, "I programmed computers, fixed broken electronic things, wrote.."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You wrote...?" he said stunned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, not to be published really, more as a way of getting at things in my head. Why?" He collapsed into the chair across from her looking pale.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Writers have more power here than most. They can make things happen, even if they normally might not." It was her turn to look afraid. "No, it’s no where near omnipotence or anything like that, but things Change when Writers are around, a Writer can have great influence over non critical things. For example I'd be willing to bet you brought that building here. The spot you are talking about used to be a row of small houses. No one lived there. They were just what was nearby. I wouldn't worry about moving in, it’s yours, you called it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She reached a shaky hand toward her stout, then took a long pull and sat back, stunned. A train whistle sounded far in the distance, "If you have more questions ask Sammi or Jemima, I think that’s their train, just wait to be sure they haven't had a hard time this trip..." He was recovering quickly, "Oh, one other thing, you'll end up looking like you see yourself in your dreams here. It'll be especially true for you, just remember that..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Chills still chased through her nerves, "Could you have Sammi and Jemima’s favorite drinks here waiting for them? I seem to recall it was Newcastle?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That’s right, coming right up, Ms. Writer!" he gave her a shaky grin, beginning to recover from his shock.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After he left she chewed on what he'd said, vowing quietly to be very careful from now on. The thoughts of the previous night returned to chase through her mind again. Big Joe’s revelations added to the sense of stepping into a weird dream and not being certain it wasn't really a nightmare, thinly disguised as pleasant. She was well into her second Murphy’s by the time the door opened and two women walked in. It wasn't until they stopped, looked, and headed her way that she knew they were Sammi and Jemima. She sat and waited uncertainly as they approached.
</p>
</br>
<p class="pagecaption">part - Meetings</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She saw them stop, stare, then continue toward the table. Suddenly the one in the back grinned and shoved her companion ahead of her. "Kali, well here is a welcome surprise! Oi!" The last bit was directed at Sammi who was still trying to distinguish Kali’s features in the flickering firelight. "Come on love, she’s even got the beers in for us - and after what we've been through I think we could both do with a drink or three." She said as she guided Sammi over to the table and pushed her into the seat opposite Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi seemed to come back to herself as Jemima pushed one of the bottles into her hand. "Don't mind me...I...I mean we - that was a bad one. But," she said as she took a long pull from her beer, "we survived. Come, love", turning to Jemima, kissing her gently on the cheek, "they say a pain shared is a pain halved - shall we talk about it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima took a long drink of her own, then reminded Kali to do likewise, "Hey, come on, if we two are going to get sozzled and pour our hearts out to you, the least you can do is return the favor - Cheers!" Another long pull drained her bottle and she immediately waved to Jo for another.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali took another deep drought of her Imperial Stout. While she was still savoring it Jo flitted over a tray with three more drinks, expertly sliding them within easy grasp of the three at the table. With a flourish of her black skirt she was off again to check on the other patrons.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima looked at Sammi who was gazing into the fire and said, "She’s had a hard trip. In fact we both have. Just now I think we both need to talk a few things over, at least you should get an interesting tale out of it!" Jemima paused for a long time before she began, "It was a hard mission. We had gone out as a standard recovery mission to a world where the dark side involvement was higher than normal. We had finished our mission and were headed back when we received word that one of the other teams had been captured. As a result we ended up becoming an Extraction Team without any warning or preparation." She took a long shaky sip from her beer. "By the time we arrived back the other team had been taken to one of the temples and were being prepared as sacrifices to the Dark Ones. Sometimes...sometimes there is no way to...sometimes the only rescue that can be performed is to send a team member into death to release them from the demonic forces. This was one of those missions. Most of the others were lucky. We found them caged outside the temple, all except Kerith."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jemima paused again and reached out to lay her hand to Sammi's shoulder. For a long moment they just gazed at each other, a stream of love and affection seeming to flow between them, then Jemima resumed the tale. "Kerith is dead and need never fear suffering again. You were right about those bastards", She nodded at Sammi, "when we smashed through the barrier they had her staked out on the altar, naked, and the vermin were pushing red hot needles into her skin. That wasn't the worst of it, though, that black priest was there, and had her mind in some kind of torment - as we raced down the nave she must have heard the noise of the engine, for she looked towards us with all of Hell in her eyes". Sammi flinched and tears ran unchecked from her eyes, remembering how she’s had to wait at an outlying spot. She had held the counter spell up so the others could get through to the temple.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At least she is beyond their reach now", Sammi fought the words round the cold lump in her throat, "but to think she died like that -"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. No!" Jemima interrupted, finally realizing what had upset Sammi so for the last two days, "Megren gave us a perfect approach, old "Shergar" rolled right up on the altar and cut poor Kerith in half - but while demonic magic ends instantly, life takes a second longer. I was leaning from the leading window, and just for a second, while we thundered forward, she was freed of her pain", Jemima gazed intently into Sammi's eyes as she went on, "Never in my life have I seen such bliss on a human face, I swear she found the havens there in front of my eyes! Her death was a release, not a torment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For long moments it seemed that Sammi didn't hear what Jemima was saying, the relief washed through her and she threw herself into her lover’s arms. "She really died in peace?" Sammi asked, as the pain faded realizing Jemima would never lie to her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She died in peace, with 55055 running down her torturers", Jemima answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What happened next?" Sammi asked, after a long moment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shergar rammed the tabernacle and all of hell erupted around us", Jemima answered, "I was still at the window, and I saw the temple engulfed in magic fire just as I was thrown to the floor. Then something, with the power of death itself, grabbed hold of the train. I came to where you found me, scorched and smoking".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi took up the story, "We were supposed to back them up. Get them out if anything went wrong. So we followed along about twenty minutes behind them in one of the steam freight trains. Where the temple had been we found only a shattered wasteland. Beyond the still smoldering bits and pieces we found Shergar, stopped and smoking. Every last bit of paint had been burned away. The carriages were wrapped in smoke. When we entered we found blackened smoldering figures collapsed on the floor. It was the most awful thing I have ever seen. None of them looked as if they could possibly be alive. It was only as they began to struggle back to consciousness that we realized how lucky they had been. There were minor burns and injuries where people had bounced off the carriage sides as everything went up. Megren was the worst with second degree burns over all her exposed skin from where she was in the engine. We hooked up to the other train and pulled it to the nearest depot for emergency repairs. After that Shergar was able to limp back here under her own power. And that's our tale", Sammi said as she sat back, relaxing at last, the last traces of tension draining from her face in the firelight.</p>
<!-- REVISE or move?
<p class="regtxt5">For the first time Sammi really looked at their guest, blushing a bit as she realized how she's been acting. Kali was an attractive woman, at least to eyes that appreciated true beauty. Her boyish figure served to accentuate her curves, producing a figure that was both androgynous and feminine at the same time. Combined with her long auburn hair, mysterious sea-grey eyes and warm, friendly face, she made quite a figure sitting in the firelight. Sammi continued to gaze at her above the rim of her tankard, taking in the long green skirt, black long sleeved top and green waistcoat, "she's like one of the faery folk", she thought.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Meanwhile Kali was examining her two new friends almost as closely. Sammi was the shorter of the two, just over five feet, with long flowing blonde hair, dancer’s build and deep blue eyes set in a high cheek boned face. Jemima was taller and a bit more solidly built with dark curly locks and pleasant rounded features.</p>
-->
<p class="regtxt5">They were still sitting after Sammi had finished her descriptions. Jemima was reliving parts of it, Sammi was still locked in the images of the aftermath, and Kali was seeing fragments of it. As they shook their heads, trying to clear the images, a band entered and began setting up. Something about them seemed very familiar to Kali, like she should know them from somewhere. After a few moments the lead singer turned and she could see her. "That's not Inkubus Sukkubus over there, is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It most certainly is", Jemima grinned back at her, "I trust you can dance?" she added, laughing eyes smiling at her above her tankard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She grinned back, trying not to let the clawing fear show in her face. The old familiar patterns of it began to build in her, but the music was so infectious that it began to ease a bit. Soon she was swaying and moving in her seat to the power of the music swirling around the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the second song began she suddenly found herself on her feet moving and swirling among the other dancers. Softly it slipped into her mind, driving the fear out and slowly becoming the focus of her every thought. At first her movements were stiff and awkward, but as the music slowly worked its way into her she could feel her joints popping and loosening like cracking the ice on fall puddles to reveal the water, still fluid, underneath.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The music wove a bright shimmering pattern in her head that her feet were compelled to follow. Surprise flared briefly that she could dance at all then the music drove itself back to the center. Her random and disjointed movements slowly coalesced into a woven tapestry of cat like grace and flow. She became obsessed with matching the ethereal pattern she could sense only dimly. Then it happened, like stepping through a doorway. The pattern flared into three-dimensional brilliance and everything became one. There was no Kali, there was no music, no pub, no band, no people, just the dip and flow of the pattern. Within it was the peace and completeness she'd longed for all her life. For an instant she saw windows and doorways into the past, the future, the now, saw what she had only imagined as she had tried to write of racial memories, of pasts back to the beginnings of time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was no sense of time or space until the music slowly faded away and the silence brought her back to the pub. Without a thought she bowed deeply to the band, then the thunder of applause rolled over her. It was only then she noticed everyone else had drawn back into a circle to give her room to dance. Panic surged through her as she realized she had been the center. Her gaze flicked and darted as she sought a way to safety. As her eyes darted across the gaze of the lead singer, the singer saw her, laughed, and launched into "Wytches". Suddenly the pattern surged and beckoned once more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi grabbed one hand as Jemima grabbed the other. Soon everyone was linked in a circle snaking and turning through the pattern. For a time she held back a bit, enjoying the contact with new friends, then as the band shifted into another song she let go and returned to the pattern. Too soon it was over. Exhausted, they staggered back to their table. Soon Jo had brought pints of water. Gratefully they sipped them and slowly regained their breath.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The promise of a hot bath drew her when she arrived home. She discovered one of the joys of being a Writer was not having to wait for hot water, even on the top floor of a building. Within moments she was curled up in her tub, relaxing in the lightly jasmine scented water. When the water had cooled to discomfort she pulled herself out, dried off, and made her way to bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As she lay there the oddity of Inkubus Sukkubus drew her attention again. The more she thought about them the more she wondered how had they been at the bar. That led to wondering if they had been shifted like she had, or if they were an echo of their presence elsewhere. Which led into wondering if a Writer had Written them there. Here she was a Writer and yet she was also a character in what was being Written. It did seem to fit, in an odd sort of way, as she realized she had always been a watcher who would sometimes participate. Her next thoughts were more disturbing. She began to wonder if the Story had come to have a life of its own. She guessed it must have, at least on some level. Was that level enough to sustain it if she or Jack died. She didn't know and hoped she wouldn't have to find out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was reminded of a theory a gaming friend of hers had once mentioned. It stated that gods were created by the beliefs of their followers. The more followers, the more power, the more influence on ‘reality’. Maybe it worked the same with Written worlds. After all, words were symbols linked in patterns, and reality was patterns. Maybe, she thought, the old alchemists had it right when they said power resided in words - words as symbols. Other thoughts struggled to intrude but sleep pulled her down before they formed.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">She awoke the next morning refreshed, quickly dressed, and headed off to meet Sammi and Jemima for breakfast. They laughed and carried on over huge amounts of food. At last she asked the question that had been on her mind during most of the meal, "Umm, I'm still not too certain what I should be doing, and I need to be doing something...I don't want to feel like a parasite here...and I know I told Jack I wanted to visit. Now that I'm here I don't want to go back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We thought you might not want to. He was sure you would. What are you good at, besides dancing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, I'm good with technical things. If I can get it apart I can usually get it back together and working...I am also good with computers..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know, you might go check at the train yards, last I heard they were needing more help. If you don't mind getting dirty it might be fun."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I'd enjoy that, although I'd like to go on some of the rescue assignments also..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't worry, almost everyone here goes at some point or another, some only the minimum number they can get away with. Some of us can't live without the excitement...even though there is great danger. Since it is the reason Death City exists it is a requirement that all residents participate in rescues once in a while..but enough for now...we can talk about that later..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Soon Sammi and Jemima were finished and hurried off to their appointments. Kali set out, past the pub, toward the dark river, running silent through the city. Following the path she passed through a gate, out of the cathedral lands and then along the river walk until it passed under the great railroad bridge a bit further down stream. There she climbed a set of worn stone stairs up to the rail bed and crossed the river. Once across it was a short walk near the track to the Temple Heath Locomotive Depot. A couple of different people pointed her in the direction of one of the running sheds and Bartholomew, whom everyone called Bart, the man in charge.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She knew she was in the right place as soon as she opened the personnel door on the side of the huge old building. The warm scent of diesel oil, mixed with old smoke and lubricating oils rolled over her. She was so busy inhaling deeply and savoring the smells to notice the stares she was getting. Just as a man near the door started to ask her what she wanted she walked over to him and asked after Bart.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He answered, "Over near Shergar, he’s checking her after last night’s excitement. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I heard he was looking for techs, um I don't think I know the right term.." She replied blushing under his scrutiny.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He looked her up and down a few times before pointing across the building to an older diesel electric locomotive. "He’s over there, in the large group of people near the engineer’s position."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks." She could feel his eyes on her as she crossed to the large knot of people. Conversation slowed at her approach, finally stopping as she asked, "Hi, I was looking for Bart? I wanted to talk with him about a maintenance position, but I can come back at a better time..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm Bart, and nonsense young lady, this is a fine time. We were just rambling on about old Shergar and all she’s seen. Come with me a moment and we'll get you fixed up." He was huge and resembled the locomotives under his care. Tall and wide with a barrel chest and arms that looked as big as her thighs. Suddenly she wasn't so sure about this. She began to remember the pictures of locomotives she'd seen, most everything in them came in sizes large to huge.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time they reached his office she was having serious second thoughts. Just as she was about to apologize and slip quietly away Bart spoke. "I guess I should ask what your credentials are. What have you worked on? What background do you have?" At her dismayed look he just grinned and added, "None is really required, other than a willingness to get dirty, to learn, and to work hard, but I would like to know what you've done before now..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She could see his opinion of her change as she described her experience, especially the time she spent as a seismic field service technician. "Good, we can use someone that understands that computer stuff and who can work under difficult conditions. Several of the latest locomotives have ‘microprocessor’ control systems in them. If you can start today I can assign you to the checkout of Shergar, that'll let you see how the older diesel-electrics work. She’s a good old one she is. It looks like she’s ok, but we wouldn't want her to quit in the middle of a run. Go over to the locker rooms and grab yourself a pair of dungarees and meet me back by her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Soon he was showing her oil points, valves, controls, pistons, vents, and numerous other things she was sure she wouldn't remember for many weeks. "Got all that? I'll test you on it tomorrow," he said with a grin. "It'll take time, but not as much as you expect."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She only worked half the day but still it was enough to exhaust her. Her arms felt like limp noodles from all the lifting, pushing, pulling and twisting that she'd done, but there was a great deal of satisfaction too. She couldn't remember when working had felt so good.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She hurried home, changed and headed for the Adam and Eve, trying to remember if Sammi and Jemima were going to join her that night.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">She was headed for Sammi’s table when Bart’s voice stopped her. "Hey Kali, don't be a stranger, come sit with us." She quickly spotted Bart at the tables grouped in the center of the room. Cheeks flaming, embarrassed by the attention, she hastily made her way to an empty chair. "You're one of us now, for good or ill," Bart continued with a huge smile. He turned and waved at Jo, "Bring Kali one of her usuals, would you? Thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali’s stout had just arrived when Sammi walked in and headed toward her table. She looked around for a few moments before she spotted Kali. "So, already abandoning your friends for these guys?" she asked smiling. "Hey Bart, how’s the loco?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not nearly as bad as you had me believing you scamp. Where’s your better half?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Setting it up so Kali can ride in the cab with us to Portal Station tomorrow. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just thought she should be keepin’ an eye on you is all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You! Kali, watch out for that one. He’s trouble."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, she just starts at the yards and already you're taking her away. It’s a wonder I can get anything done around here." He turned and winked at Kali. "Just remember, the longer you keep her, the longer it'll take to get your locomotive back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi was about to reply when Jemima burst in and started toward them. "Got it!" She said, waving a scrap of paper in one hand. She pulled Sammi into a tight hug before turning to Kali and continuing, "Tomorrow morning you get to go to Portal Station with us in the cab of the loco."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pull up a couple of chairs and join us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes sir, mister Bart, sir." Jemima answered with a smile as she grabbed a chair and spun it to the table. Sammi quickly settled into one of her own and they spent the rest of the evening in pleasant conversation.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">As Jemima rose to leave she turned to Kali, handed her the cab pass, and said, "Meet us at Central Station at sunrise with the permit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Muscles protested as Kali stood. She stifled a groan and waved at the table, "See you guys later. I'm home for bed." She slowly made her way home and labored up the stairs to her rooms, where she quickly started a hot bath, after dropping a generous amount of bath salts into the tub. As the steam rose, she stripped and sank slowly into the rising water. Soon she was drifting through half formed thoughts as the heat loosened her tired muscles.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tired and finally pain free she slipped into bed and drifted right into sleep. The next thing she remembered was the full moon shining into her room. It must have been the middle of the night, yet it seemed almost as bright as day. Worse, she was wide-awake. She lay there for long minutes, willing herself to sleep again. At last she gave it up and climbed out of bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She wandered the room for a while until the pull of the moonlight became too much. Hurrying to her wardrobe she pulled out the cat suit, saw how tightly it would fit, and threw it in the back corner. She pulled on a flight suit instead. As she turned to the stairs, the doors and the balcony above her garden, caught her eye. In seconds she had slipped onto the balcony and from there onto the slope of the roof. She waited for the fear and vertigo that had followed her most of her life to overwhelm her once again. It whispered in the back of her mind, but didn't come forward very far. After waiting a few minutes she prowled along the left ridge line to the end of the building. There was a three-foot gap and a ten-foot drop between her roof and the next one over. Looking over to the end of the right ridge line showed the same three-foot gap and a drop of 8 feet. Frustrated she stalked back to the windows and headed down into the building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her hand was on the main doors when she remembered the horrible squeal it would make if she opened it. Not wanting that level of noise she slipped deeper into the building. A hallway led down the left side it and ended at a door. Carefully she turned the knob. This door opened on silent hinges and let her out into the narrow canyon between her building and the ones behind it. Here and there shapes huddled in the deeper shadows. A closer look revealed people under blankets and in large coats. They had to be street people, but they didn't look quite as beaten down as the ones she was used to. The clothes they wore were somewhat clean and in reasonable repair and they didn't smell like they feared water and soap.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She started toward the street when she heard a large group approaching, probably from the Adam and Eve. Quickly she ducked back into the alleyway, only to be brought up short as a woman’s voice said, "Ye need not fear them. Ye be safe in Death City and in all Eternia from the rest of us. It be only yourself ye need fear."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Startled, Kali snapped out, "What do you know of me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ye be one of the rare ones. Ye walk the shadow line by choice, that be why ye have the hand of the Dark Mother on ye. Ye did not die to come here. Your transition is a different one, it be of flesh and spirit. Yet e’en so, ye be less than comfortable in yer skin."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shadow walker, fence rider, great, another place where I'm too much in the center to be valid. What gives you the right to judge me?!?" she spat out, her face twisted into a sneer by bitterness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ye don't understand, do ye girl? Here Shadow Walkers have a place. Ye walk between worlds here, as ye walked between extremes in the realms. This is the place between, a place where the tasks of salvation and rescue are taken seriously. Balance and center are very important. Here those that understand Between have the best time of it. Here ye be judged only by how ye aid those around ye and ye be safe from all but yourself. Beyond these borders though, that be a different matter. The forces of evil will seek to destroy ye, to prevent ye thwarting them. The forces of good may walk over ye, confusing ye with the evil uns. Always the Dark Mother watches over, she who was before the Others. But here I'm chattering on like some crazy magpie and ye be cold of spirit. Go, find yer peace. Old Lizbet be here when ye want to talk again girl. This alley be my home."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Strangely calmer Kali made her way to the front of her building where she could see the cathedral in all its glory. She didn't see the old woman shimmer and fade into the night. The cathedral drew her closer as she studied the flying buttresses and spires arrogantly poking into the heavens. As she neared the building she began to see small cracks and gaps in the stonework. Before she really thought about it she was climbing. Each new foothold spurred her hands to seek the next space. Slowly and steadily she worked her way up a buttress, across an arch and higher up along the roof line. Her fingers and feet seemed to know just where to go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After an hour of steady climbing she reached the top of the highest spire. Wind whistled through her hair and the moon bathed her in silvery light. Something started to shift in her. The last terror of heights faded quickly before the light, wind, and stunning views. To the east and north the river curled it's way around the cathedral close. Very slightly to the north and east was the Adam and Eve, and to the south and west, Central Station, where she would join Sammi and Jemima in the morning. To the west was her building and another section of the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the sun began to color the wispy clouds in the east she began the climb back down to the street, then figured what the hell and slid instead to the belfry. From there she boldly strode down the stairs and out onto the street, receiving a couple of startled looks from others in the cathedral, but otherwise no one said a word.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Soon she was out on the street and headed toward the path along the river. As she turned past the Adam and Eve she headed as if to Temple Heath. Once she reached the rail bed she turned away from the river and followed a pathway to the front of the station. She stopped in awe of the beauty of that massive old building. Victorian architecture soared skyward and massive sections of glass glistened in the coming light.</p>
</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Journeys - Into the Void</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali stood and admired the station as the sun climbed higher into the sky. At last she turned and entered. A quick flash of the cab permit from Sammi and the conductor waved her past, pointing toward the head of the train. She slowly walked toward the engines, stopping once and a while to admire the gleaming blue and gold coaches along the way. Soon she emerged from the traceries of the overhead glass and ironwork. She passed the last three coaches and reached the twin diesels, already idling in preparation for departure. Even at idle they radiated power and presence. Fascinated she walked slowly by them before stopping to lean against a nearby signal gantry. Sammi had told her this wasn't their normal train. Shergar and her coaches would be in the works for many weeks yet. Sammi had managed to wrangle a driving turn for the upcoming short trip to Portal Station. These locomotives were Class 37 diesel electrics, not the Napier Marine Deltic that Shergar was.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">While she waited she looked around at the other platforms, watching the other trains arriving and departing.  Railroad equipment from dozens of different countries, or worlds, were waiting or being serviced. It produced a wonderful riot of color and shape. Abruptly a short train roared away from the next platform, rapidly disappearing into the dawn brilliance across the rail bridge. As it vanished in the distance strong arms grabbed her from behind while Sammi’s voice asked, "What shall we do with this one then?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She spun when Sammi released her and grabbed her new friends in a quick hug, "Bright greetings!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I suppose we'll have to take her with us." Jemima answered.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The sound of moving pulleys caught their attention as the signal above their heads changed to ‘Clear’. Sammi led the way to the lead locomotive and they scrambled aboard. Behind them there were shouted good-byes and sounds of slamming doors. Somewhere in the distance was a shouted, "Hey, wait for me!" Followed by an answering, "Hey, Kyrnan, can't you ever be on time?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi moved to the driver’s seat and motioned Kali to the other chair while Jemima moved behind Sammi and settled her hands on her shoulders. Sammi unlocked the controls and activated the warning devices. Kali watched with intense interest as Sammi went through each step of departure. A whistle blew in the distance, which Sammi answered with a short blast from the horn as she released the brake. With a jaunty grin she eased the power controller open. There was a slight lurch as the traction motors took up the load. With a snarl the locomotives began to ease forward. Like a waking beast it slowly gained speed as it clawed its way down the track.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, Stick your head out and have a listen", Sammi called over the rising roar of the engines, "I'm going to thrash this one!" Jemima reached over and opened the cab side door near her while Kali and Sammi opened the windows near them. Leaning out, as the slow moving train cleared the end of the platform, Kali could see the varnished coaches smoothly gliding along behind.  Sammi opened her controller a bit more, now the two Class 37s really began to roar, and Kali felt the train surge forward.  With a clatter of wheels on joints they were on the river bridge, glancing back into the cab Kali could see the Cathedral spire through the open door beyond Jemima.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jemima’s eyes were shut as she drank in the singing of the diesels. Sammi kept the regulators set just below the maximum limits as they roared along. Power sang through the floor and chair that Kali sat in. She leaned out the window again and reveled in the whipping wind. Soon they thundered through open park land and then over a small rise and down through an industrialized valley. It took only moments to rush through the brick lined cuttings, under plate girder bridges, and back out into the warm sunlight.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As their speed passed sixty, Kali pulled her head back out of the brutal wind. Her gaze drifted to her new friends. Jemima was leaning close to Sammi, stroking her shoulders while one of Sammi’s hands rested on hers. They almost glowed with the love they shared. Suddenly Sammi looked at her and winked, letting her know they had been aware of her gaze.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi reluctantly shut the power down when their speed reached eighty. The engines dropped back to the low rumble of their idle as the train coasted along at eighty-two miles per hour. Other routes branched off to the right and left with growing frequency. The main line had increased to four tracks and was running under an elaborate overhead signaling system. Kali could make nothing of them but Sammi seemed to know exactly what they were saying.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soon the four main lines increased to six and Sammi smoothly eased over to the right hand pair of lines. They were running through what looked like the industrial zone of a large Victorian working city. Factories, mills, and brick works stood along the lines and canals and wagon ways wove a tight web tying the rest of the city to the tracks. Ahead, on a hill rising higher than the chimneys and warehouses, were buildings of white stone, surrounded by spaces of green. The four left most lines headed toward it, curving slightly to the left, then running straight into a gradually deepening cutting. The twin tracks they were on branched to the right and ran through a valley of rock walls, swinging away from the city center and arrowing toward the distant mountains.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi pulled the controller wide open again as they cleared the city junctions and headed out into the suburban areas. Large houses with tree shaded lawns and gardens swept past while another junction brought two lines in from the city to join and form four lines again. Then they were climbing, here just gentle slopes that slowly brought them out of the green valleys and into the rolling foothills of the approaching mountains. Sheep placidly gazed at them as they roared by.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Could I ask you about this place? About Death City and Eternia?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You can. What would you like to know?" Jemima replied.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why everyone is so reluctant to tell me about it. How I got here. Why I got here. How does this place work?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Truth is they aren't being guarded on purpose, it's more that most of us don't know much. The Dark Lady determines who comes here and she hasn't told any of us how she decides. She arranges the way you get here as well. Again it's different for everyone and it is sort of a hard thing for most to talk about. There's usually loss and pain when it happens. As for how this place works, well, that's a bit simpler. Everyone has a desire to contribute, so they find things they don't mind doing and then they do them. You've met Big Joe and Jo, they enjoy running the Adam and Eve. Bart likes to work on the trains. And so it goes. We like the rush of missions, so we are out most of the time. It varies from person to person. It is expected that you will go out once in a while, but if you don't like it, you don't have to do it very often."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">An hour later they were clinging to the side of the Mountains of Chaos. The four lines ran along a narrow ledge of stone blasted from the living rock of the towering mountains. Deep shadows blanketed the tracks, where the high peaks blocked the sun, and lent a dark mystery to the scene. The engines strained at maximum power rolling along at just under seventy-five. Narrow valleys and high waterfalls broke free in spots, one so close the spray left patterns on the wind screen. Moments later they screamed into a short tunnel, its walls throwing back the pulse of the engines. Immediately beyond the tunnel was a long span arching over a dizzying drop to a large river far below. Once again Kali was glad her fear of heights had faded. As they twisted and climbed higher the tunnels and bridges grew in numbers until they seemed to be alternately burrowing through the bones of the world and soaring through the heavens. Ahead, Jemima explained, lay the Great Portal, the main gate between Death City and Eternia and the rest of the universe. At the Portal lay Portal Station where Sammi would hand the train over to the regular crew who would take it into the void.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Abruptly the line swung around the shoulder of another mountain and Kali could see the Portal. Vast it was, huge and ancient, forged by the gods themselves in the ancient deeps before time began. Its boundary was a massive oval of metal, the color of age stained bronze. Within it was a pulsing, writhing something that no matter how hard Kali looked it wouldn't define itself. It pulsed with all colors and no color, at once a flat sheet of nothing and a view of everything that ever existed. As she stared at it she found herself drawn into it. Always feeling if she stared for a minute longer it would resolve itself into something.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's best not to look at it for too long". Kali started slightly as Jemima touched her shoulder. Kali's mouth formed a silent "Oh", as she gradually brought her mind back from  the distant realms the Portal had carried her to. She was still aware of its vastness, towering above everything beyond the next range of mountains, but now she had recovered herself she would not again allow it to draw her gaze. Instead when she felt she just HAD to look at it, she would slip a sidelong glance its way, then quickly look back at something else.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sorry!" Sammi called above the roar of the engines, "we should have warned you. To be honest, it still freaks us out, and we've been here for years"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok", Kali responded, smiling across the cab at Sammi, "I'm glad I saw it. It's when you see things like that, things made not for mortal eyes, that you realize how precious a gift life is". Now the view of the Portal was being slowly cut off, as the train swung closer to the next range of mountains.  On the other side, Jemima explained, was the Junction she'd spoken about, right at the edge of the Portal.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The chasm the line was following branched in two, and Kali found herself crossing an impossible bridge, a slender arch of lattice girders carrying the line right across the bottomless void below, then they were over and plunged into utter darkness.  This final tunnel cut through the heart of the Mountains of Chaos. It was a four mile stretch of deepest black, cut through the living rock. Above it were the highest peaks of the range, one of the great barriers of Eternia. It threw back the sound of the diesels in ever increasing echoes until there was no escape from the pounding, crashing noise. Kali had never heard such sound before, on and on it went, amplified  and boosted, nothing could escape from it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As the pounding drove into her, she began to build a refuge of dance in her mind. As she danced her way deeper and deeper into the pattern a form began to take shape in front of her. Black as the void around the shining pattern, a necklace of skulls hung around her neck, the figure shimmered in front of Kali, ghostly, yet solid. Her voice blended in the echo of the roaring engines, "You have taken one of my names for your own. Yet you doubt yourself still. I gift you your word of power and I curse you to live the name you have chosen. You shall be as mother to your friends and as destroyer to your enemies. Your anger shall be quick and powerful, your love shall be boundless, yet the control of these sides shall be yours to master. You shall be remembered in the register of Death City - it is your choices that shall form the manner of that memory." Light flashed across her eyes, blotting out the vision as the train thundered out of the tunnel and began slowing to come to rest at the Portal Station.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She was still slightly dazed and disoriented as Sammi led her down from the cab and into the station to await their return. "Intense isn't it? It’s never become common for me! Now I don't know how long we'll have to wait. The Portal is always busy, but it could be some time before there’s room headed back."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Several trains came through during the next two hours, but they were all full of personnel or supplies. Shortly after yet another full train had slowly accelerated into the tunnel a voice boomed out over the announcement system, "Sammi, Jemima, Kali please come to dispatch."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi shot the other two a puzzled look as they quickly walked to the door next to the information counters. Kali looked from her to Jemima and back and asked, "This isn't normal then?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, usually we just wait until a train has space available and then get on." Sammi answered as she knocked on the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The door opened immediately to the cluttered office of the dispatchers. People were huddled in front of computer monitors displaying glowing traceries of lines and symbols. Beside each symbol was a name and number. As they entered a blond woman turned from her console as she pushed a hand through her already mussed and tangled hair. For a brief moment she just looked at Kali before saying, "We have a situation on Delestra 6 where the rescue mission has encountered heavy opposition. There is a team trapped under heavy fire. I need a small group to go in and set up an extraction. Try and get the train out. Failing that, set up a Rescue Beacon and Power Shield then dig in until we can get you. I'd like to send more people, but I don't have anyone close enough right now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi glanced at Jemima and quickly agreed. Then she turned to Kali and said, "If you want to come, you can, but no pressure. If you don't feel ready to jump into this high a danger, no one would have a problem with you declining."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali considered briefly then replied, "No, I'm here to make a difference. I'm not experienced yet, so if you think I would be a liability, then I'll stay, otherwise I'm in."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good! I have a train and driver waiting to go as soon as you board." She handed Sammi a large packet and continued, "This is all the information we have on the area. It was supposed to be a quiet zone so we didn't prepare for this. Good luck!" She then turned back to her console and keyed a couple of switches, then began talking softly into the headset she wore. With a grin and a wave to the room Sammi was bounding out. The other two followed almost as quickly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They were met at the train by a long haired boyish looking man who Kali was certain she should recognize. "Welcome aboard!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once on board Sammi and Jemima took Kali to a weapons locker. Sammi pulled out a blaster rifle and handed it to her. "Have you ever used a gun before?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A pistol a couple of times with a friend of mine."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good, this isn't a lot different. Actually it should be easier, there’s no recoil to worry about. This is a MK986 heavy assault blaster. It can deliver one blast every two seconds and has a power pack good for 50 shots. It comes with an optional backpack assembly that boosts the number of shots to 1000. This particular one also has the add on grenade launcher attached. It holds five grenades and has a range of about 40 meters. It doesn't take long to get used to it and where we're going it sounds like there will be no trouble finding targets."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The train began moving as they dropped into nearby seats. Jemima snagged the packet and tore it open. Soon she had papers and maps spread out, covering a small table, and was intently studying what she found. Her finger traced a subway route then stopped under a large building. "This is where dispatch believes the team is right now. They were supposed to enter the subway system, then use it to access three additional locations. The last communication from the team indicated they had completed recovery operations on two of their three targets but were pinned down in the subway while trying to get to the third." Jemima pointed to another page of drawings and continued, "This is where they recommend we go in. Rather than risking getting trapped in the subways, we'll come in at the old train depot on the surface." She traced a small dotted line over to the first page. "Following this drain system should put us near the museum section of the tunnel. With any luck we won't have to fight our way through major forces until we reach the subway tunnels themselves. After that, we play it as it falls. Our main goal is to recover the team, after that we'll see what we can do."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't understand, what is a Rescue Beacon? Can't they just send a train in the way the original team went in?" Kali asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Normally yes, except the regular routes might take a long time to traverse. A Rescue Beacon allows dispatch to create a track route directly to the trouble spot. Help can arrive very quickly that way. A Power Shield is a magic device that raises a shield around an area. If we can't end the battle we can hide inside the shield until help arrives."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Almost too quickly a large thump and bang announced the train was back on real space track and slowing as it thundered through wrecked buildings and stacks of rubble. With a final hiss of brakes it rumbled to a stop in the center of a burned and tumbled shell of old stone and brickwork. Within moments they were standing away from the tracks as the train clawed its way into motion again. Quickly it accelerated down the tracks and roared through an opening in the far wall.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi and Jemima were already settling their packs and gear as Kali turned from watching the departing train, still trying to remember why the driver had looked so familiar. Then it came to her, she had seen that same picture on a web page. He was Jack, the other Writer. With a grin she turned and joined Sammi and Jemima, adjusting her pack and blaster as she walked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It took some searching to find the stairs down under all the rubble in the main areas. Then it took more time to slip and crawl over and around it to the old subway passages below. By the time they reached the lower platform they were covered in old soot, ash and cement powder. At first the going was easy as they followed the old passages to the subway station located below. Then they pulled up a large grate and dropped into the storm drains. For about 20 meters it was dry and easy then it turned and angled down. Slime and oil covered the bottom of the tunnel as it descended to meet a larger pipe. Here there was a thick floor of viscous mud and water.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The tunnel slanted down a ways further until they were wading through thick water or thin mud. Sammi grinned at Kali and commented, "This would be fun at any other time! Well, except for the stench. Right now it’s just a nightmare." About 500 meters along this tunnel Jemima motioned to the left and up a short ladder to a smaller tunnel. Single file they climbed up and into it, crouching as they went to avoid the lower curve of it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The unease started slowly with a prickling at the back of Kali's neck. As they silently crept single file through the tunnel she found her hands tightening up on the blaster she carried. Eyes seemed to stare at her from the blackness around them and every sound seemed more and more ominous. Insecurities whispered to her of failure and death. Heart pounding she focused on Sammi in front of her and tried to ignore her rising panic. Her hands were beginning to hurt from clenching her blaster when Jemima signaled a halt at the last ladder up. She scrambled up for a look then trained her blaster on an old, rusty lock. It took only one shot to destroy it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">No surprise attacks greeted them as slipped into the tunnel above. They passed a side branch and another curve before Jemima held up her hand to hold. A reddish glow pulsed and throbbed from around the next bend. They could hear screams of pain and howls of rage broken every so often by the sound of weapons fire.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Softly they crept forward and rounded the bend. Grotesque lanky grey figures shrieked and gibbered as they threw themselves into the small knot of people huddled behind piles of rubble on the subway platform. Sporadic weapons fire would drive back the closest grey things and for a moment there would be a break then the grey things would close again. Sammi motioned at Jemima to take one side and for Kali to follow her into the other side.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For the first few seconds they had surprise and cut into the ranks of the grey beings. Then they turned and charged. Black bolts of energy leapt from a tall shape in the shadows of a stairway. It blasted a chunk of cement from the floor where Sammi had just leapt from. Kali froze as the mob of creatures rushed toward her. Then Sammi shoved her back yelling, "Snap out of it! Dance, damn it!!" A long narrow hand with razor claws ripped through the space where she had just stood. It was enough to break her loose. With an cat-like roar she spun and began firing back into the charging crowd. Twisting and dodging she kept herself out of danger while hurting her share of the enemy.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly the shadow spotted her and let loose with a wicked looking blast. In a move of pure desperation she dive-rolled over a fallen chunk of tunnel and heard an ominous crunching sound as she landed on her right shoulder. Sparks flashed from the damaged weapons pack on her back. Instinct drove her hands to the quick release on the straps as she dove away from it. A brilliant flash of heat and light told her how narrow her escape had been.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Now weaponless, she turned to retreat and saw Jemima knocked down by a glancing blow to her head. Something snapped inside her. An inhuman shrieking roar ripped through her throat as she hurled herself at Jemima’s attacker. Claws raked its throat out as she howled in triumph. Teeth pulled back in a snarling rictus of rage and feral joy she danced and wove her way through the left flank of grey beings. She left broken and bleeding corpses in a dark wake behind her. Teeth narrowly missed her and claws whistled around her as they tried to bring her down. Always she was just a fraction faster. Once she glanced back and saw Sammi, frozen, watching her. In a voice both terrifying and seductive she called, "Come, dance with me." The grey beings stopped and turned toward her, people started to rise from their covering locations, and Sammi walked toward her. The demonic forces shook off the thrall first and fired into the rising group of refugees, startling them into diving behind cover once more. Sammi blocked a blow by instinct, then shook her head and whirled back into the battle.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali continued her mad frenzy of destruction until a black blast shattered the floor at her feet. A howl of rage shredded her throat as she grabbed the nearest grey thing and hurled it into the stairs. It was still flailing as it slammed into the shadowy figure hiding there. She had a quick glimpse of a pulsing sparkle of light before slashing claws drew her back into the fray. Soon the entire left flank lay in bloody tatters at her feet. Still in a frenzy she spun seeking new targets and launched herself toward the nearest ones. As she drew back for a swing Jemima’s voice broke through, "Kali, it’s over. They're all dead. It’s over. We need to check the train and get a power shield readied before they bring in more."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As quickly as the frenzy had arrived, it departed. Kali was left standing and drained, with greenish blood, grey flesh, and ichor dripping from her curled fingers. It coated her clothes and clung to her skin. The smell of death slithered through the last of her adrenaline haze causing her to gag and retch. Confusion crossed her face as she croaked through her raw throat, "What happened? What have I done?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She touched you in the tunnel. The Lady touched you, didn't she?" Jemima asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I...I think so...No...she did, I remember..." Kali whispered as they walked toward the other team.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sammi had reached the other team and was making introductions as Kali and Jemima walked up. "Merris sent us to get you out of here. I am Sammi, this is Jemima, and this is Kali."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Jemima asked, "Where is your driver?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Tom is," A woman replied, pointing to a man where he sat cradling a broken arm.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Are you able to drive?" He shook his head. "Anybody else know how?" The rest of them shook their heads no as well. She looked back Tom, "Do you think you could give Kali enough instruction that she could take the train out? We need to..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I can try..." Tom started to reply.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We need to go. All of us." a woman broke in rapidly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wha..." Tom started to say.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Trust me," she said with absolute conviction. "We'll be cut off in  minutes if we don't. Everyone, get the wounded on the train. We are leaving." She returned to speaking quietly into a com unit.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The team gathered their wounded and loaded them aboard. Tom stood shaking his head. "We aren't going anywhere. I was trying to tell you, the engine is damaged."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, think you could fix it?" Jemima asked. "Sammi and I can put up a shield in the passage before they come back. It should slow them down a bit."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe I can. Come on Tom." Tom trailed slowly after Kali as she hurried to the engine and disappeared on board.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The woman turned to one of her team mates, "Max, you're with me. The rest of you, whatever happens, don't let the train stop for anything."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Take the Power Shield," Sammi called.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, you need it to block the passageway by the stairs, where you were going a minute ago." She hurried up the rail tunnel with Max following along behind. Sammi stared after her, shook her head, then headed toward the passage with the shield device.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Inside the locomotive Kali was peering into the smoke from the engine section. Taking a deep breath she plunged in. Hoses, wires, and pipes ran everywhere. Narrow spaces snaked and twisted their way through the packed equipment. Nothing looked too bad until she came to a junction box for the traction motor feeds. Melted copper, charred bakelite, and burnt insulation greeted her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Tom, are there any tools? I need a socket set and some really big pliers."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Should be one in the back of the compartment. How's it look?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Bad. I may be able to cobble something together, I'll let you know." She reached for a melted section of wire then stopped. "Tom, how long would it take to start up again if we shut the diesels off? I don't want to get fried here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A couple of minutes. They'll still be pretty much warmed up."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good, would you please?" She waited until the engines wound down then began pulling on wires. Everything had been precisely installed, allowing for no slack. "I can make this work, but it will mean scavenging parts from the dynamic braking feeds. We will need to be really careful going down from Portal Station."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She worked rapidly cutting and joining, using scavenged connecting blocks and insulation pieces. At last she stepped back from the cobbled up mess. "Ok, start her up and lets see if this works."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The diesels slowly wound back to life. Everything seemed to hold together as Kali stepped back into the control cab. "Now, let's see if we can get out of here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Here, as driver you need to be in communication with the team lead." Tom picked up a com set from the control console. "There's a switch on the panel, there," he pointed to a selector, "That determines if you are talking to the train, the team wireless channel, or dispatch." Then he talked her through setting the Automatic Warning System. She cringed at the noise as it began to sound. She spun around and stabbed the cancel alert button before she even sat down. She dropped into the control chair and moved the reverser control lever to engine only and pulled the power handle towards her. The change in engine she expected didn't happen. Tom looked at her nervously, "That's not right. It should have responded immediately."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After a nervous glance out the windscreen she turned and climbed back into the engine compartment. Inside the compartment she could hear a ragged edge to the idling of the large engine next to her. As she moved toward the rear of the compartment she heard a faint hiss coming from the far side of the engine. Twisting and sliding around the engine she found a vacuum hose split where it slipped over a fitting on the fuel injection system. Grabbing it she pushed and twisted it until she managed to shove it far enough onto the fitting to get past the break. The slightly ragged edge immediately quieted as the big engine settled into a deep rumbling purr.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She scrambled quickly forward and took another nervous glance out the windscreen. The power shield was up and glowing a rich golden although behind it she could see moving forms collecting.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With hands suddenly sweaty she pulled the power lever again and was rewarded with a slow winding up of the engine behind her. Next she pushed the brake handle to the running position, drumming impatiently on the power handle as the vacuum gauges slowly crept up to 21 inches. When the needles touched the lowest edge of the mark she shoved the reverser into forward and pulled the power handle hard towards her. "Easy," Tom called. She grinned back at him and moved it back only when the ammeters almost touched red-line. Slowly the train began to move. As her speed started to climb she kept pulling the power handle to keep the ammeters just below the red. "Nice touch," Tom said.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The train continued to accelerate smoothly until it hit the first incline up out of the tunnel system. It began to slow quickly as its momentum was lost to gravity. Her speed continued to drop as she rounded a bend and saw two figures engaged in a magical fight with a horde of demons.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She started to push the amps harder when a voice crackled in her com, "Kali, coast a bit, we need to get those two."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm losing momentum, too much and we won't get going again..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Give us just a little bit. It'll be enough."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She kept her hand on the controller but didn't advance it. Their speed continued to drop until a walking person could out-pace them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Got them. Let's go!" Jemima called. Kali pushed the controller hard, running right at the bottom of the red zone. The smell of ozone filled the cab as she heard sparking coming from the back.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Jemima, prep for battle. My fix may not hold."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly the train strained forward. Ahead the tunnel banked right and continued to climb. Through the com she heard Jemima giving directions.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She rounded the bend only to see a figure standing in the tracks before her. Soon she was close enough to see Sammi waving at her to stop. One look at her speed and the ammeters convinced her there was no way she would be able to start again if she did. Instead she reached up and grabbed the horns, sounding them in a long blast. The figure ahead seemed to flicker slightly as the sound crashed over it. With a mumbled, "Shit, shit, shit..." she pushed the amps into the lowest area of the red zone. The figure flickered and changed into a smallish grey creature as it tried to dive out of the way of the train. With a whoop of triumph she stormed over it and around the next bend, into the light spilling in from the surface. Another minute brought her out of the tunnel and onto flat track. Moments later they were climbing away from Delestra 6.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You could be a driver if you wanted," Tom spoke from the jump seat.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You have the touch and you're good in a crisis. All you need is to learn the procedures and road rules." He leaned back and closed his eyes. "You need to call dispatch and report in. Ask for Merris and explain...No, wait," He stood awkwardly and fumbled in a cabinet behind the jump seat. He jammed a com unit on his head and continued, "I'll handle dispatch, you just listen and observe how it works."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dispatch, this is Delestra 6 train 2."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Delestra train 2, this is dispatch. Good to hear your voice again Tom."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Janine, wasn't sure we were going to make it. We need routing back. Be advised we are coming in with a damaged train, an inexperienced driver, and wounded."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Delestra train 2, so advised. We are giving you clear and direct routing. What is the nature of damage to your train?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dispatch, I will let Kali, replacement driver and mechanic, give you the details."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Um, this is Kali. To get moving I had to disable dynamic braking and use parts to get the traction motors back on line. We have air braking only."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Understood. What level of driving certification do you hold?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"None. I am the only one available. Tom is injured but able to talk me through the process." She heard a sharp indrawn breath on the on the end.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Delestra 6 train 2, this is Merris, head dispatcher. I will be your contact for the rest of the journey. Kali, how did you end up driving?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sammi and Jemima had to tend to the power shield, and then there was a secondary attack. We didn't have time to switch. Most of the original team are injured and none were driving rated either."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok. Is Tom well enough to help for the entire journey to Portal Station?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Merris, yes I am," Tom replied.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good. I'm going to give you the simplest routing I can. Please stop at Portal Station. I might be able to provide a relief driver at that time. Otherwise maybe Sammi could take over."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It felt like hours and like minutes at the same time until they reached the Portal and Portal Station. Not knowing the finer points of when to release power and begin braking caused Kali to finally stop about a hundred meters past the station buildings.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Merris, I'm afraid I didn't do so well on the stop. I'm still on the siding, but just barely."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good enough for now. Could you come on in? I'd like to see you. Ask Sammi and Jemima to as well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali made the call back to the train and then climbed down and slowly walked back to the station. Sammi and Jemima joined her as she neared the station doors. "Knew you could do it!" Sammi commented as she pulled Kali into a tight hug.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The station seemed to be deserted as the made their way to dispatch. Kali knocked on the door. After a long wait the door swung open and a frazzled man’s face came into view, "Yes?" His eyes widened as he caught sight of the three of them and the state they were in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We're back from Delestra 6. Merris wanted us to check in."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just wait here a minute." He turned and shouted back into the room, "Hey Merris, it's the group from Delestra, you want to talk to them?" She couldn't quite make out the reply before he turned back and said, "Wait here a moment."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris stood and rapidly make her way toward the door. She stopped and stared at Kali for long moments. Slightly uneasy from the scrutiny Kali began, "Sorry for the mess..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">""No, no, it's ok. I know you guys had it rough..." Her voice trailed off as she looked again. Just as Kali was about to speak again she said, "Sorry, just a lot on my mind... What were you saying?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The train's back. I don't know what to do with it next and I was wondering if you had a relief driver. Or if Sammi had to take it over."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"First congratulations are in order for getting the train and crew back. And congratulations to you, Kali, on successfully driving it back. We're short on drivers right now, so Sammi will have to take it down. I'll clear you the simplest routing to the Temple Heath yards and call ahead to have the healing teams standing by."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali turned to follow Jemima back to the coaches as they approached the train. "Oh no you don't. I think you should drive down. Tom and I can keep you out of trouble."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But Merris..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, she won't know, will she? I'll take the com and Tom and I will help with the signals and procedures. Unless you really don't want to?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali hesitated for long moments until a wicked grin finally split her face. "No, let's do it."</p>
</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Journeys - After the Void</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris had made it easy to make the trip back to Temple Heath and the trip provided ample distraction from the thoughts chaotically banging around in Kali's head. The trip down from the Portal was particularly intense as she had to keep the braking right so the train wouldn't speed up and lose control. There was a reprieve when she had to navigate the local track into the city, to drop the wounded at the main hospital. There was an additional reprieve when she arrived back at Temple Heath Yards. Bart came striding from the repair sheds as she slowed the train to a stop on one of the sidings. "Merris called, said you had a spot of trouble in the Void." His eyes took in her condition as he approached her, "Guess she was understating as usual. What did you do, take on the entire force of evil?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, yes. A large number of them anyway." Sammi replied. "Kali, you going to be ok? I'd like to hop a train back to the hospital and check on a couple of friends." She stopped when she saw Kali's white face. "I can stay if you'd like though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I think I'll be ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you're sure then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok Sammi. You go, I'll be alright. It's just reaction to everything." Sammi turned and walked toward Central Station.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Images surged in her mind at the reminders. This time, with no adrenaline haze to keep them distant, she remembered the feel of tearing flesh, the screams of the dying, and the vigor with which she attacked. As she stood trying not to cry, Bart came closer, "I'm sorry Kali. I was just kidding. Looks like your first trip was a hard one. Do you want to talk about it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mutely she shook her head. "It’s ok. If you ever do, I'd be glad to listen. It changes you, a journey into the Void." She tried to smile her thanks while she struggled to get her voice under control. Then as calmly as she could she explained the damage she had found and what she had done to repair it. While she narrated she led him to the trouble spots and pointed out her repairs. "Good job, that. You can help me fix her up starting tomorrow. Right now I expect you're tired from the run and wanting to clean up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Again she nodded. Bart turned and headed back to the sheds after a long look at her. Suddenly everything she had needed to do was done, leaving her standing in the waning sunshine with nothing left to distract her mind. For a moment she leaned against the engine, weak with reaction. Then she pushed herself away and made her way toward home. Everything felt wrong, the clothes she was wearing felt more baggy and ill-fitting than they had that morning, her footsteps were uncertain and clumsy, and her mind kept wandering, replaying the battle over and over in her head.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">She avoided the few people she saw on her way back to her place. After trudging up the stairs she stumbled to the bathroom and started a hot bath. She slid into the warm water and was just starting to relax when she noticed all the stuff floating around her. Disgusted she sprang upright and whipped the curtain around the tub. Her toes plucked the drain plug out as her hands twisted the water on full. First she rinsed as much muck from the flight suit as possible, then slithered out of it. Her sports bra was too large and floppy over her chest and her underwear slid down with the flight suit. She half fell and half collapsed into the bottom of the tub as she realized how much she had changed. Her breasts were small and tight again, her stomach flat and trim, and the hated wrongness no longer peeked from the thatch of dark red hair at her crotch. A hysterical laugh surged from her as her hands verified what her eyes were telling her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still in shock, she pulled herself up, staggered from the tub, and swung the bathroom door closed. A stranger stared at her from the full length mirror on its back. Gone was the roundness of her mom's face. Her cheek bones were higher and more sharply defined. The ski jump end of her nose had flattened out and her jaw line was sharper and harder. Her eyes had gone from bland blue to warm grey. Flared hips, trim waist, wide shoulders and a dancer's body had replaced the lumpy hybrid of before. She turned and twisted in front of the mirror, examining her new form. Slowly she settled to the floor and opened her legs. Gently she spread and touched the changes. Everything seemed right, including the growing warmth, wetness, and pleasant tingles her explorations started. Awkwardly and hesitantly she teased pleasure from herself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cold water dripping from her hair finally reminded her to step back into the shower and finish washing and drying off. Once she had finished she walked up to her bedroom for clothes. By the time she reached the room a wild giddiness had replaced the shock. She danced around the room naked. For the first time in her life she didn't care if anyone could see in from outside.</p>

</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The echo of a large gong reverberating through the room jerked her to a stop with her eyes darting around the room. Bart's voice echoed up the stairs, "Kali, hey, are you home?" Frantically she dashed to the closet and grabbed for an oversized t-shirt. Throwing it on she flung herself down the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm here. Coming, just a minute..." She cleared the bottom of her stairs just as Bart reached the top of the entry stairs. "Uh, hi..." she started and trailed off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You looked pretty knocked about today when I saw you. I thought I'd stop by and make sure you were doing all right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you find me?" She pulled her arms across herself self consciously, then quickly dropped them as she realized what that would show off. Suddenly she felt naked and exposed. She backed quickly into the sitting room, held her shirt down as she dropped into the pillows and covered herself to her chin in them. It helped a little bit and she started to relax.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I asked Jo at the Adam and Eve. She pointed me here. You still look like you're not doing too well. You sure you don't want to talk about it?" Bart slowly followed her. Carefully he sat in the chair by the window. "This place changes everyone. Often not as quickly as you changed, but you seem to have your own momentum. Extreme things in the Void speed it up as well. It can be hard," He settled back in the chair with an air of calm waiting, content to let her take her time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The word changes echoed through her mind. Terror followed it swiftly as she thought about the biggest change of all. Suddenly she wondered if she would get periods, be fertile, and have to worry about pregnancy. She couldn't think of anyone she could ask. No one knew her past and she wasn't sure she wanted to tell anyone either.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An icy fear of Bart crept into the terror. He had seen her in just her shirt. Worse, he would have noticed how good she looked. In an instant she knew the shadows were lost to her. People would notice her. Bart had noticed her. She didn't know what she would do if he found her attractive. Under the pillows she shivered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali? Are you ok? Is there any way I can help?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She backed further into the pillows until the wall stopped her. She tried to shake her head but it came out in a series of twisting, jerking motions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali?" Worry colored his voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Gods, what's happening to me? Look at me. This morning I was dumpy, ugly me and now, now I'm...oh gods." The tears spilled over and traced silent tracks down her cheeks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You weren't ugly before, but you thought you were and you hid behind it, didn't you? It let you avoid attention." He stopped as her saw her eyes widen in fear. An icy fist grabbed her chest. Black spots danced in front of her eyes as she struggled against the dark waves of panic the thought of attention brought surging to the surface. "Kali?" Bart tried again. He sat rigidly still in the chair, afraid to move at all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His stillness allowed her enough control to finally get a small breath of air. Mutely she nodded slowly as the black spots faded slightly. "Attention was never my friend," she began in an almost silent whisper. "From little onward, I only got noticed for the things I did wrong. The shadows became my friends as I learned it was better to not be noticed. I don't want anyone attracted to me. I don't want to have to deal with it. I don't want it!" Her voice started to climb into hysterics.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, shh, it's ok. It's really ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no, you don't..." She stopped suddenly, not wanting to reveal anything. "It's not ok. Why did this happen? Big Joe said we look like we see ourselves. Why do I look like this? I didn't see myself this way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He only mentioned part of it. We think we're who and what we were in the Realms, but it isn't true. This place lets us be what we could have been. I bet somewhere inside you wanted to be athletic and you wanted to look good, but you couldn't let yourself. The Lady makes adjustments as well, things to help you heal or grow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What I could have been...Gods, I..." She stopped suddenly. She huddled silently for long minutes. "I don't know how to handle this. I was a shadow in the Realms. I just want to be a shadow. I want to be left alone," she continued in a broken voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry. I want to tell you that you can remain a shadow here, but I can't. You haven't been since you arrived. Jo told me of you dancing with Sammi and Jemima. You have already made a name for yourself by what you did today."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His words pulled her eyes up from the pillow she had been staring at. His eyes were sad and his face troubled at what he said. "What I did today. Oh gods...I did things, I've become things today..." Tears welled in her eyes and she pulled in on herself once more. Bart waited patiently hoping she would continue. The memories pushed forward, bringing with them the predator that had let her rend and kill. It ripped into her terror like a kitten into a mouse. In the fleeing wake of the terror hysterical joy bubbled to the surface. "I killed, with my bare hands, and I fucking enjoyed it!" Hysteria tinged her triumphant confession. Her voice dropped back to a broken whisper as joy gave way to confusion, "What's happening to me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are changing, becoming..." Bart paused.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Becoming..." She looked up and continued, "Becoming what? I see the blood and flesh on my hands even now. But even worse I remember the pure joy," her face twisted into bitterness and disgust. "The joy I felt in ripping them to shreds with my hands." For a moment the mask slipped and he could see in her eyes the fight between the joy of the killing and the remorse and fear it caused her. "I liked it Bart. That's the worst of it. I liked shredding those things, feeling the flesh tear under my claws... even now part of me still likes it, wants to do it again. How can that be right? It's not anything right in any of the things I know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took all Bart's will not to flinch at the predator he saw looking out through his new friend's eyes. It was more terrible than her terror had been. It faded slowly, leaving her behind, but he could almost see it still pacing in the cage behind her eyes. "I'll tell you something few know. In the Realms I was the class nerd. Everyone picked on me because I preferred to use my brain and I was a skinny little thing. I can't begin to describe the rage I felt every time I looked at my tormentors. When I arrived here I got a chance to see what it was like to be strong. It was a new chance but I had to learn what to do with that rage inside. Change always brings fear and uncertainty. Trust the Lady if you don't trust yourself. She thinks you belong here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A new chance..." she whispered. Suddenly she thought of something and began laughing almost hysterically, "No wonder Merris looked at me funny when I came back. And I thought it was cuz I was covered in ick..." They laughed for long minutes and then Kali lapsed back into a pensive silence. Bart sat and waited until she at last said, "I should try and get food I guess. Gods, what about everyone else? I don't know if I can see them right now. I feel so...fragile."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't have to. Do you have anything around here? I can make you something or go out and get us something..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, maybe I should, I don't know. I guess I should try. The fear is so seductive... If I don't try it'll be the Realms all over again. But they won't even know me, will they?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It'll be fine. I'll be right there with you. Everyone's used to seeing the newer people change. No one will think it unexpected."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll be right back. I should wear more than this..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">""I don't know, the pillows are quite fetching."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right. Uh, could you close your eyes?" Kali waited until he did then dashed for the stairs. She returned shortly dressed in one of her flight suits. "Ok, guess I'm as ready as I will ever be."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">They made their way to the Adam and Eve in companionable silence. Kali had her nerves under control until Bart pulled open the door and waved her in first. Then it hit her again as she saw the crowds in the pub. Bart's calming whisper helped a bit, "Remember, everyone here has gone through this themselves." That got her back to where she could walk calmly to the Temple Heath table. "Hey everyone, we're here." Bart announced. "I have an important announcement. Our very own Kali," he bowed briefly to her, "was with Sammi and Jemima on the daring rescue at Delestra 6 earlier today. I think she deserves a round of applause. She proves once again that we aren't just a bunch of tech nerds." Applause and appreciative laughter echoed around the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Face burning, Kali dropped into an empty chair and tried to simultaneously slip under the table and cold stare Bart to death. "Um, it was nothing." She mumbled as she tried to slip away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart gently held her in place. "Oh no you don't. You did a good thing today, something no one is expected to do, especially a new arrival. Live it up. Enjoy your moment in the lime light and tell us about your first trip." He continued in a quiet whisper, "There is comfort in the sharing of it. Think of this as your first step out of the shadows."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't really do much, other than not get in the way..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not get in the way? We would have died if it hadn't been for the three of you. Don't let her fool you, she leapt into the fray like an avenging angel and single-handedly took out half the demon forces." Kali stared at the speaker recognizing him as one of the team huddled on the platform. He was about to continue when he glanced up and saw her white and strained face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In a tight voice she said, "It wasn't me. I wasn't in control. My gun jammed and I was terrified when they came at me. I lost it. I couldn't have stopped even if I'd wanted to." Her voice rose in pitch and volume as she leapt to her feet almost shouting, "Don't you understand? I COULDN'T have stopped..." suddenly she realized she was shouting and stopped, collapsing into her seat with her face in her hands.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stunned silence endured for several moments until Bart asked, "So, what are you drinking Kali?" Then conversations started up again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just as her nerves were calming down a voice called from across the table, "Way to go Erick, embarrass her some more why don't you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Erick had the grace to blush as he leaned close and said quietly, "We all fear things about ourselves. You may even let it cripple you, if you must, but know this - I would stand by your side against the evil anytime and anywhere. I refuse to fear you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Not looking up from the table she mumbled, "Murphy’s Imperial Stout, please." She intended to sip one for a little bit and then quietly slip away, but soon the tales of Void trips were flying around the table. Slowly she was pulled out of her mortified silence and gradually drawn into the tales being told around the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was as startled as everyone else when Bart’s voice cut across the crowd again. "Merris. Merris, over here. Decided to come down from the mountains and join the rest of us for a bit?" Kali glanced up then looked again. Nerves had kept her from really looking at Merris in dispatch. She was dressed in a black leather jacket that looked like it had seen a few too many years. Underneath she was wearing a dark blue top. Worn black jeans and scuffed work boots completed the outfit. Her hair was still tousled and as Kali watched she reached up and ran a nervous hand through it before easing her way toward the table. As she drew closer Kali saw care lines worn into her face and realized she wasn't as young as she had appeared.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everyone shifted again to crowd one more chair in around the table. Merris ended up wedged between Kali and Erick. "Erick, didn't expect to see you here. I thought you'd be taking a well deserved rest."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well, what better way to celebrate surviving than drinking with my mates? Besides I wanted to thank the lady to your right for saving my ass today. Heard tell she was hanging with this bunch of clowns when I got back, so here I am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The tales resumed again where they had left off. Pints were refilled again and again as the evening wore on. The tales turned to ones of embarrassment and troubles. Each person around the table had at least one trip where they screwed up badly and it was only through luck or help that the mission was saved. When her turn came Kali launched right into her adventures, telling all that happened. She found herself feeling curiously better afterward, like it had provided a catharsis for her soul somehow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For the first time she started to relax, and as she did, exhaustion stole over her. After her third yawn in as many minutes she rose and announced, "I think I should be going, I want to be functional at the yards tomorrow and it’s been a really long day," She stood to go, only then feeling the number of pints she'd had. Every time her glass had neared empty another one had appeared. She couldn't remember how many she'd actually had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris stood up and steadied her. "Hey, someone tell Big Joe I took Kali home." She turned to Kali and added, "He doesn't like anyone staggering home alone, says it’s hard on repeat business." She followed Kali’s lead as they reached the street, then hesitated a moment at the door to her building. "Don't remember this one, what floor you on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Top, but I'm ok from here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh no you don't. I'm supposed to see you home, and that’s what I'm going to do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But, what about you? If you see me home, then you'll be staggering home alone," Kali returned with a grin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just drop me on a floor somewhere, I'll be fine. I don't have to be back to dispatch for the next couple of days, so I can head out when I wake up." Slowly they worked their way up the stairs, stopping for extended rests at each landing. "So, anybody else share this building with you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I haven't seen anybody, but there are four floors they could be on. And there are several people in the alley behind here. What’s the what with that? Is there a housing shortage here? I thought this place provided what everyone needed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It does, but if some of your worst memories are about things that were done to you in buildings, maybe the street seems a better place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn. Guess I didn't think of that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone finds the place they need to feel safe here." She paused and looked thoughtful before continuing, "For example I have bad memories from my bedroom, so I like places that don't remind me of it. Places like the couch in dispatch."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The couch in dispatch?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah - there's this green leather couch that I sleep on. Since I'm a workaholic anyway it saves a lot of time. Sure, I have an assigned room where I can wash up and change, but I can usually be found in Portal Station Dispatch."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They finished the climb to Kali’s rooms in silence. Kali took Merris on a quick tour, quick slamming two pints of water while in the kitchen, then pointed her to the pillows in the lounging area. "Do you need to see me to bed, or is home close enough?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should verify your safety to fully complete my mission. I wanted to tell you, I like the new look. Are you doing ok with the change? It can be really unnerving at first."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, no, I'm not sure. Everything's so sudden and new here, I think I'm mostly still in shock and denial," Kali replied. "Well, if you have to verify, it's this way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Grinning, she followed Kali up the stairs to the bedroom and gave it a quick survey. "Not bad for a bedroom. Great view!" She exclaimed as she turned and spotted the cathedral through the windows. With a grand flourish she pronounced, "I declare you safely home." She fled back down the stairs to the pillows as Kali collapsed on the bed.</p>
</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Settling In</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali awoke with the dawn, the water had once more prevented the hang-over, but she was less tired than she expected. Quietly she slipped downstairs and into the bathroom. Emerging, she bumped into a sleepy looking Merris, who was rubbing at her eyes. "Morning already?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, you can sleep more if you want. I'm headed over to Temple Heath to look at the locomotive from yesterday. Bart promised he'd let me help. If you get hungry, you can have anything you find."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Still used to the Realms aren't you? Except for missions, schedules here are really flexible. If Bart gets there before you, he'll wait. I suspect though that you'll get there before him, even if you wait another hour or two. He was still going strong last night when we left."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I'll head out anyway. I'm awake and if I try and go back to sleep I'll just feel awful later. Hey, thanks for the escort last night. I'll see you later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks for the comfortable floor space. I'll have to escort you home next time I have too much at the Adam and Eve."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali emerged into the growing light of the day and headed toward Temple Heath. Her thoughts were bouncing and chaotic as she walked. It had felt good to walk home with Merris, yet she didn't know anything about her. It had been surprisingly pleasant to wake up to another person in the place. She hadn't realized she missed having a roommate that much. Laughing quietly at herself she shook off her thoughts and concentrated on looking at the city around her. She watched the shadows fall back before the sunlight, the glints off the river, and the sounds of waking going on around her. Slowly the city woke and activity started at a much less frantic pace than in Seattle. The few people she passed were happy and friendly, waving and calling out greetings to her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She walked confidently to the main shed at the yards and let herself into the cavernous building. Someone had moved the locomotive into one of the bays with an inspection pit and had removed many of the cowlings and covers to expose its inner workings. Breathing deeply of the diesel and oil laden air she walked slowly around looking at the locomotives in various stages of repair. Then she crossed to the office section and wandered into the large room that housed the drawings and documentation on the equipment the yards repaired. Finally she emerged through another door into the sunlit yards beyond. Lost in thought she wandered among the various pieces of rolling stock and locomotives parked on the sidings. She had just turned to return to the main shed when a run down building across the yard caught her notice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her curiosity drew her to it, as it had her apartment before. Slipping in through one of the partially open main doors she found herself in another cavernous building. Shafts of light streamed in through gaps between the planks of the walls and dust motes danced in the air where she had stepped. Smells of old oil, wood, metal, and smoke spoke of the age of the shed. Locomotives and odd rolling stock peered back at her from under layers of dust, rust, and disuse. A closer look showed many had been used as parts units at some time in their lives. She was about to head back when a lurking shape in the very back drew her attention.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Crossing slowly to it she recognized the outline of a Baldwin M-4 class locomotive. She remembered it from web surfing shortly before her departure. Even more curious she walked closer and could just make out the number 232 on the front of the engine. She could see rust everywhere and most of its paint had flaked away. Caked grease and dirt clung to the cylinders and wheels. Rust holes had eaten through parts of the cab. Carefully she approached and peered into the cab. More rust holes had eaten into the firewall and corrosion had frozen the valves. Saddened, she turned away and threaded her way back to the yards, then back to the main shed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This time the place was alive with conversations and noises as the technicians started the day’s jobs. Bart met her at the office from the other side of the shed. "Did you get home ok? Sleep well? Ready to take a look at her today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I got home just fine, slept well, and I'm ready whenever you are." She glanced sideways at him, trying to judge the intent of his questions, but saw only his normally friendly look. She was about to ask him about Merris, but changed her mind and mentioned the Baldwin instead. "I arrived a bit early today and was snooping around..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing wrong with that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I came across the other shed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His look turned sad. "Oh, the bone shed. A depressing place isn't it? That’s where we put the ones that are too far gone to repair easily. Once in a while someone will take one on as a special project, but most times they get used for spare parts. I wish we could fix them all, but there aren't enough of us, or enough time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I saw an old Baldwin locomotive in the far corner, number 232, I was wondering what her story was. I remember reading that she had been headed for the scrapping torch. How did this one come to be here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know much, really. A recovery team was at an old railroad repair facility just before it was scheduled for demolition. They'd been sent in to recover various parts for some of our existing engines. They found number 232 in one of the back sheds and managed to bring her along. I'm not sure what they were thinking, she was in bad shape even then. For a little while a couple of them had thought of fixing her up. It turned out we didn't have any information about her and they lost interest. No one else had time, so she found her way to the bone shed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The little bit I read on that class indicated that they were fast and powerful." She paused, then continued, "Well, anytime you're ready."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Today I thought we'd go over the loco. I'll show you the normal repairs and familiarize you with it. Tomorrow we can start on the traction motor wiring  and the brake systems you cannibalized." They spent the rest of the day thoroughly checking over the locomotive. Bart explained what he normally checked at each step and pointed to examples of various problems. It was another intense day of work. They ended up replacing most of the fuel system and planned the wiring harness for the next day. Every so often Kali would find her thoughts returning to number 232. While they worked she asked questions about everything they were doing. By the end of the day her brain was packed full of new information and her body was exhausted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As she and Bart were leaving he turned and asked, "See you at the Adam and Eve for a drink later?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe. First I need a long bath and maybe some food, although I don't feel like preparing anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Big Joe sets a good table. Quite a few of us find it easier to just find a place to get food. If no one else has explained it, things you need are just provided. Big Joe loves to cook and run the Adam and Eve, it’s his contribution. Just like yours is the work you do here."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Later, soaked, scrubbed and dressed in clean things she prowled her kitchen. Nothing she had interested her. After one last look she headed to the Adam and Eve, figuring she could find something on the menu. As always the place was full. She was headed to the Temple Heath table when she spied Merris at the Vault bar. Threading her way over she slipped into the just emptied seat next to her. "Heya, come here often?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When I'm in town..." Merris replied with a grin. "Best steak and kidney pie in Eternia."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really? I haven't had any since the Unicorn closed in Seattle several years ago." Kali turned to the bar just as Jo hurried up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, would you like anything with your Imperial tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How about a steak and kidney pie?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Done! Hey Merris, you want a refill on that india pale?" Kali just caught the thoughtful smile that crossed Merris face as she answered yes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few moments later Jo returned with Merris order and the pints. Kali watched with a grin as she dug in. "Good?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mmm hmm! Here, try a bite."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly Kali found a fork in her face with a generous bite precariously balanced on it. Quickly she took it, before it could slide off onto her lap. Immediately tastes flooded her mouth. It was so far beyond what she had before that there was no comparison. "Wicked awesome!! I can hardly wait for mine now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, Merris, are you two going to be anti-social all night, or are going to come join us?" Bart hollered from the Temple Heath tables.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Busted. We were but we'll be right over anyway." Kali and Merris grabbed their things and threaded their way over to the crowded table. Chairs shuffled and shifted as they approached until enough room had been created for them to squeeze in. A moment later Jo arrived with Kali’s order. The conversation quickly returned to engineering and locomotive problems, leaving Merris a bit left out. She didn't seem to mind as she settled back and sipped her pint. Once in a while she would ask about a specific locomotive that had come back damaged, or that had been recovered from an aborted mission, but mostly she just listened.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All too soon it was way too late and the party started breaking up. This time Kali had been a lot more careful of how much she had. She stood with no problems and turned to go. Merris stood unsteadily a moment later, "I'll make sure you get home ok," she slowly said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a moment Kali thought of telling her she was ok, the reconsidered noticing how wiped out Merris looked. "Wicked, thanks!"</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The next morning Kali woke late to a dark, stormy sky. The smell of coffee and sounds of things rattling and banging drifted up the stairs to her. She staggered to the bathroom, threw cold water on her face and then made her way to the kitchen. There she found Merris busily engaged in producing breakfast. "I see you found the kitchen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It’s the least I could do for the use of your floor."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There were pillows, you could have used them..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad you said that. Now I don't have to feel guilty for having already thought of that," Merris replied, grinning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're cheerful this morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That water thing you told me about before really does help. I'm doing fried potatoes and sausages, would you like anything else?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um...wow...no, that'll be fine. Thanks!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They ate in a companionable silence for a time before Merris commented, "Quite the place you have here. It looks like you've been here quite some time to get this comfortable."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not really. It was a lot like this when I found it. Although quite a bit more dusty." Merris stared intently for several moments, but Kali was too busy eating to notice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stop in at Portal Station next time you're headed out. I'll probably be catching a ride back later today. It’s hard for me to be away for long, there’s something about the Portal that calls to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will, I can't imagine not going out again. How do you get on a team?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are several ways. The easiest one is to show up at Central Station and let the platform people know you're available. That'll get you a one or two day mission. You can talk to them in advance and tell them what you'd like to go out on. Then they'll contact you a few days in advance. Lastly, you can tell me and I'll let you know when something you want is going. Did you have something specific in mind? Like long missions, or day only ones, anything like that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know yet. I've only experienced the one. I'm embarrassed to admit I really enjoyed the excitement of it though. I spent most of my time in the Realms trying to avoid conflicts and battles. Most of them seemed so stupid anyway. Things like ‘I don't like the way you dress, the way you look, the way you talk...’ They all seemed so pointless. There was something important, something valuable, about fighting for the lives of the other team. I think I want to be part of those kinds of missions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could certainly use another person for those missions. For the longest time there was a truce. Our teams weren't ever in danger of attack. About a year ago it changed. There aren't many people here who will do the kind of mission the three of you did. There are even fewer who will do a second one. Talk to Anastasia at Central Station if you are serious, she leads the main team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked! I can always withdraw later, if I change my mind?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, as long as you aren't in the middle of a mission. I don't think it would work if you stood up in the middle of a fire fight and said you were quitting." Merris smiled. "On a different topic - are you thinking of becoming a driver? You did really well with no training."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, I'm thinking about it anyway. There’s something magical about controlling that much hurtling metal...I've always liked mechanical things, they're easier to understand than people."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't cut yourself short. You do ok with people too." Merris countered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked away in embarrassment, then mumbled, "Gotta get going...see you again..." Merris smiled warmly at Kali's retreating figure for a few moments before turning to the breakfast dishes. She quickly finished them and took a few moments to wander through the flat in the daylight. Every so often something would catch her eye and she would stop for a moment or two for a closer look. She spent the most time in the study, carefully looking at the book titles on the shelf. There were plenty of software tutorials and references, a few electronics texts, a scattering of architectural treatises, and quite a few fantasy and science fiction novels.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Throughout the place there was little that said anything about Kali, other than she liked being comfortable. The furnishings were warm and inviting, without being cluttered, but there was precious little artwork. Only two pieces said anything about their owner. One was a warrior woman holding a labrys and glaring coldly out of the image, titled ‘If Looks Could Kill’. The second one was of a cat woman and a human woman cuddling on a driftwood log, near a fire. It was captioned, 'Out of the Water'. Looking closer she noticed there was an artist’s initials and a dedication of, "To Kali in memory of a really awesome game, R."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finally she ended up back at the stairs to the bedroom. She started to climb, only to be assailed again by the unease that had followed her most of her adult life. Half way up the stairs she paused long enough to tell herself, 'This isn't even your place. This is not your bedroom.' After three deep breaths she was able to continue. The view drew her even before she had cleared the stairs. Almost in a trance she crossed to the windows and gazed out on the Cathedral of All Faiths. Reluctantly she finally turned away and completed her survey. 'You certainly are an enigma aren't you Kali? Why do I find you so fascinating, is it because you are such a mystery?' With a rueful shake of her head she gazed at the cathedral a few minutes longer, then headed downstairs and out into the threatening weather.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Spatterings of rain were beginning to fall as Kali arrived at the rail yards. Inside it was warm and cheery. Bart was already at work on the locomotive, pulling apart the clot of wires that had gotten it home. "You're smaller than I am. Why don't you get underneath and begin taking the cowlings off the wire-ways and truck motors. All these wires need to be replaced." They spent most of the morning opening up the wire ways and removing the damaged pieces.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali was pulling the last of the traction motor lines when one of the others came over, "Kali, Merris is on the comm for you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just a minute," she replied as she traced the wire in her hand to its end. She wrapped a cut off bit of wire around it so she could find it again and climbed out from under the loco. "OK, where do I find it?" He led her over to the office and to the handset sitting on the desk. "Kali..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey there! Just thought I'd let you know I made it back safely. How’s your day going?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bart and I are in the middle of the wiring harness for the engine. Things are going well. How’s it for you?" They chatted for a few minutes longer, then Kali made her way back to Bart.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everything ok? Is there an emergency?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No...why?" Kali replied uncertainly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you do it? Usually Merris never calls unless there’s some type of problem she needs help with."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She just wanted to tell me she made it back alright." She looked up just in time to spot his grin, "What?!?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing," Bart replied with a smile. "Now, where were we?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the day passed quickly as they traced out and checked the harness. Every so often Kali would find Bart grinning at her, especially when he thought she wasn't looking. Once in a while he'd have to prompt her when he would find her staring off into the distance. Near the end of the day he said, "You could go visit you know. Just hop a ride up to Portal Station tomorrow. This isn't the Realms, you don't need to show up every day for work. All I ask is you let me know when you won't be here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She doesn't call anyone, except for work?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, and she doesn't come down from Portal Station more than once or twice a year. When she does, it’s never for more than a day. You sure caught her attention."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once again she walked home with many things on her mind.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">She didn't go to Portal Station the next day. Instead she returned to Temple Heath to finish up with the locomotive. Once again sleep came late and fled early, leaving her awake as the sun came up. Unable to sleep any more and with still too much on her mind she grabbed a cup of coffee and headed to the yards. Once there her steps turned to the bone shed. Carefully she climbed all over number 232, peering at linkages, valves, and tubes. She was trying to match her limited knowledge of steam engines with the reality of a complex locomotive. The big parts were easy. What confused her the most were the reverser system and the inlet and outlet valve controls on the drive cylinders.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart found her at the front of the engine, staring intently at the valve assembly. "I thought I might find you here. It looked like you might have been bitten by the steam bug. Let me show you a working one." He directed her outside and over to the main yards. There he showed her around a "Pacific type" 4-6-2 locomotive, built by American Locomotive, explaining the parts and systems. Finally he took her into the cab and explained the driving controls.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As they headed back to the main shed he slowed and commented, "I'm going to pry now. You can tell me to bugger off if I offend you too much. Are going to go to Portal Station sometime, or are you going to ignore what could happen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes...no...I don't know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This, even more than the Realms, is an uncertain place. Don't throw away chances at connections, whatever they may be." They walked on in silence.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The day flew by as they rebuilt the traction motor and braking wiring.  Around mid day Kali was summoned to the comm again. She returned to find Bart studying the same junction panel he had been looking at when she left. He was fighting hard not to grin like an idiot as he made a great show of moving to the braking control system. Once he gained a bit of control he asked, "Everything ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alright, I give...tomorrow I think I'll take a trip to Portal Station." Kali commented with a bit of a laugh. Bart’s grin widened even more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time evening came her decision had given way to a bad case of the nerves. She walked back to her place so wrapped up in thought that she didn't see the smiles and waves of the people she passed. Her feet took her past her building and on to the Adam and Eve before she even realized where she was going. Within moments she was at the bar, Murphy’s in hand, and a steak and kidney pie on the way. This time she spotted Bart before he saw her and made her way over to the communal table. The conversation and companionship kept her mind off her growing nervousness.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The next morning Kali stopped at the Adam and Eve briefly, then headed to Central Station and asked about passage to Portal Station. Twenty minutes later she joined the line of passengers on the platform and soon was aboard. Her seat was by a window looking out away from the platform. She settled back and waited for the trip to begin. The whistle blew, the train started to move and a stab of longing ripped through her. It grew and changed into frustration as the trip stretched on, longer and longer. Even thundering through the last tunnel didn't produce the mystical experience it had on her two other trips. It just felt like an eternity in the dark. Finally the train pulled into Portal Station. She stood quickly and, with borderline rudeness, pushed her way to the door as quickly as she could.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris stood in the shadows near the station doors, grinning for all she was worth. "Hey, I'm glad you came up," she said as she swept Kali into the hug she had been secretly hoping for. She stepped back and noticed the little storm cloud that seemed to be slowly dissipating above Kali’s head. "Was your trip ok? We didn't have any reports of trouble."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I guess so. It just felt strange to be stuck in the back with everyone. It’s so different when you're in the cab. Were you serious when you asked if I wanted to be a driver?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course I was. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd have thought everyone would choose to drive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A lot do at first, then they change their minds. Some when they think about the danger, you are, after all, the first person on the scene if anything goes wrong. But most of them stop when they think about being responsible for the locomotive, the rolling stock, themselves, and every person aboard. Few people here want that. All of us gravitate toward what we can handle. I don't like personal danger, but I love excitement and intensity, both of which I get a lot of in this job. Many people love danger, but don't want to have someone else pay if they screw up. What I'd recommend is go to Central Station and tell them you want to be a driver. They'll get you started with the training and then you can see if you really want to do it. Now let me show you my world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside the station Merris took her everywhere, showing her the common areas, then leading her through the support areas and offices. Then they went through the living areas, sections of the station where support personnel slept during their time there. It was much larger than it looked from the front, extending well back from the tracks. She saved dispatch for last and explained in intricate detail the computer monitoring and navigation systems that made it the hub of the Void part of the railroad. Local traffic control was a joint effort between Portal Station and the control center in Death City. Then, with a grin, she pointed at an old dark green leather covered couch crouching in a far corner. Its covering was old and worn and a faded blanket covered the back. A large monitor hung above it, displaying the same information as the lead dispatch system. "Here is the infamous couch I was telling you about. I can keep an eye on things until I fall asleep and can get the picture right away when I wake up. It allows me to exercise my control fetish - a perfect prerequisite for this job." She finished with an impish grin. "Now, I've managed to pry myself away for the afternoon - how should we spend it?" She led the way out one of the back doors of the station and over to a cluster of benches. "It’s much nicer out here. You know, there’s a place you might like, if you don't mind a bit of a walk..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, lead on!" Merris set a brisk pace up the valley behind the station. They hiked in silence for a while, enjoying the sunshine and air. After about a kilometer Merris turned up a narrow side canyon that began to climb steeply into the dense forest of the slopes. Fifteen minutes later they struggled up one last steep slope and into a hanging meadow. In the center was a small lake, fed from the surrounding mountains. A grassy swath lined the edge of the lake nearest them, with several large fallen trees providing rude benches. Its beauty took Kali's breath away. "It's wicked awesome!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I come up here when I need a break. Nobody else really knows it's here. There's another lake in the lower valley, most of us just go there, it's not quite as pretty though..." They slowly made their way to one of the logs and sat down. Each wrapped in her own thoughts, they stared out across the lake and to the mountains beyond. "How're you doing? Settling in ok? Most of the time its not that exciting right at the first..." Merris asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm doing ok, I think. Just confused about a lot of things. Like how a few emails about a cool story idea could change into this..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone’s arrival here is strange in some way. I think it must be the nature of the place. As to the email, well, there are those who move between the Realms scouting for others who would fit here. This isn't ‘heaven’, the havens, or whatever you'd consider the afterlife to be in the usual sense. We can die here. When we do, it is the final death, there is nothing left to cycle back around. So we do need to find others to continue the work."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Might I ask how you came to be here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It’s usually considered impolite to ask, but that’s ok. I was in Duluth, Minnesota, in a punker band and into trouble a lot. One night we played a gig near the waterfront and got really fucked up. During the gig one of the lake’s frequent storms came up. By the time we were ready to quit for the night the rain was pounding and wind was gusting. One of my band mates dared me to walk the top of the breakwater along the ship way. Never one to refuse a dare, especially from them, I hauled myself up and started walking. At first it wasn't very hard, until the wind started picking up. Full of myself I climbed around the weather gate and continued out to the lighthouse at the very end and was about to jump down onto the walkway and head back. A particularly big gust caught me and threw me into the water instead. The shock sobered me up quick, but a wave threw me against the concrete and about blacked me out. As I faded out I saw a woman leaning out from a train car offering me a hand up out of the water. I grabbed on for dear life and ended up here. I still don't know exactly what the selection process involves. I can't think of anything that I did that would land me here. What brought you here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much that I can think of. It had been a terrible night at the end of a bad week. I had gone to my favorite place to eat and encountered my ex-partner and her latest. I paid for the food I didn't eat and left. It was raining and one of those delightful blustery nights that guaranteed I wouldn't be bothered as I walked home. As I passed one of the side streets I saw a tram that didn't seem to belong. When I approached the driver offered me a ride and restlessness prompted me to answer yes to his offer to take me here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, you are one of the Shadow Walkers. I was wondering. I thought you were but then you changed so quickly and completely. Usually Walkers don't change very much at all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shadow Walkers? What’s that?? Changed? Oh, right..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shadow Walking means you can return to the realms any time you wish. You didn't die to come here. It is a great blessing..." Merris stopped mid sentence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali waited for her to continue having heard something in her voice that implied it wasn't actually a great blessing at all. "There’s more than that, isn't there?" Merris looked away, embarrassed. "Please, tell me. Look, nobody will tell me what's the what around here. Please don't you do it too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris began slowly and softly. "It’s also something of a curse, or so it seems to me. Now, remember, I haven't known many Walkers, so this observation is based on a very small sample. They were never able to enjoy what they had. It was like there was something always chasing them, driving them from place to place, adventure to adventure. They always volunteered for the most dangerous missions and threw themselves into the most intense activities. It was almost like they had a bit of a death wish."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A cold shiver ran up Kali’s back as Merris spoke. She remembered all those times when it felt like she had been pacing a cage in her day-to-day life. It was that restlessness that had driven her into the tram. "We're not all like that. I want a quiet place and minimal danger. What...?" Merris eyebrows had shot up as Kali talked. "Really, I'm not like that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right. Within the first few days of arrival you have already gone off on a very dangerous rescue. And, rather than stay safely in the background, you leapt into the very center of it. Then you want to be a part of the fighting missions instead of the safer recovery groups."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked away, unable to deny it. After a couple of quiet minutes she turned back and gave a lopsided grin. "Maybe I'm guilty as charged..." A few minutes later she asked, "Do you still play music then?" attempting to change the conversation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I was getting tired of it anyway. All we ever did was scream and play thrash chords. I wanted more room. Then when I got here, well there was so much happening I never really got back into it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you ever think of it? Would you want to get back into it? You could always go solo and do what you'd want."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, maybe... If I could find the time...but I'd like it to be with others, doing interesting stuff."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They sat for a while longer watching the afternoon shadows flow slowly toward evening. Finally Kali stood and said, "I suppose we should be finding our way back." Merris stood and watched her for a moment, fighting to keep the rueful grin off her face. Kali stopped when she saw it and blushed. "I guess I do have trouble sitting still sometimes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly they made their way back down toward the station. As they went they swapped stories of growing up around Lake Superior and Fairbanks, Alaska. The station was a warm pool of light in the darkness when they arrived. "You can stay here tonight, if you want, or there are trains headed down all night. There’s always traffic through the Portal..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess it wouldn't hurt to hang out till morning..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good!" Merris exclaimed. "Let me get you settled in a room..." it took very little time to find an empty room and get Kali assigned to it for the night. "Sleep well! If you need anything you know where to find me, the ugliest couch in Dispatch..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali laughed, "The only couch in Dispatch...See you in the morning..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her demons leapt from the shadows as she closed the door and chased through her thoughts, replacing the pleasures of the day with dark insecurities. Her mind dredged up every scrap of conversation and examined it for hidden meanings. By the time her head hit the pillow she was convinced the growing attraction she had felt all day was only in her imagination. Sleep slid up over her and dragged her into chaotic dreams that lasted most of the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She awoke slightly depressed and irritable. She hesitated outside the door to dispatch, thinking for a moment of just leaving, but then turned and entered. Merris was at one of the consoles rapidly tapping keys. She glanced up ready to snap at the intruder until she saw it was Kali. Then she stood quickly and practically tackled Kali in a huge hug. Several others in the room glanced up in surprise, before turning back to their consoles. "Hey there! How'd you sleep? I'm glad you stayed!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um, ah, fine..." this wasn't what Kali had expected and it caught her completely by surprise. Then the warmth of the day before slowly returned and she smiled back. "I'm glad I stayed too! What’s the what? It looks crazy in here again..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yup, just like I like it. It’s pretty normal though, but it does mean I won't be able to get away today..." She twisted her mouth into a comic pout before continuing, "But I'm thinking I might head down your way tomorrow or the next night. Is that floor space still available?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Always!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You going back, or staying for a while?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was thinking of going back down. Yeah, mostly restless I guess..." She said as a haunted look passed quickly over her face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't think I blame you much. It'd be pretty dull sitting here watching the rest of us work...see you in a day or two then..." Merris grabbed her into a long hug, kissed her cheek, and let her go.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The train deposited her back at Central Station. Walking through the mid morning sunshine she found herself lost in thought. Her mind wouldn't stop whirling around bouncing from relationships, to Death City, to missions, and around again. She couldn't decide if she wanted another close relationship this soon after the disastrous one with Anne.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her footsteps took her to the narrow alley behind her building. She came out of her trance as Old Lizabet spoke, "Ye be troubled. Be it somethin ye’d like to talk about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, I'm just not sure even what is bothering me so much. Things just seem to be happening really fast. There are so many different directions I can go here and I don't know how to deal with it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ye have an idea about most things, don't ye? What be really troubling ye?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked down at the cracked paving stones before softly answering, "Merris. I don't know what she wants. She’s attractive to me and it scares me. I don't think I'm ready for anything more serious than friendship. Maybe that’s all she wants, but..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ye think she wants more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ye want more..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, no, I think so...I don't want to get entangled. I don't even know who I am right now, or what I'm doing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Listen to yer friends. Stop thinking so much and let things happen as they may. Ye might become friends, ye might become more. Let it unfold as it will. If ye want more romance her and see what happens."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I'm not ready!" She remained silent. Kali sank into thought, finally continuing, "But I guess people rarely are, are they..." Lizabet smiled. They sat in silence a while longer, then Kali rose and left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She paced her apartment unsettled and restless as she struggled again with what she wanted. Trying to distract herself she looked through the books in the study, turned on the computer and tried to lose herself finding out what was on it. She started reading one of the stories she was working on. For a few minutes it was ok, then her muscles started to cramp and spasm. Next her skin started feeling scratchy and irritated with the chair. Standing helped a little bit, but moving helped more. When she sat back down her heart sped up and the cramps returned with more force.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stood again and paced around the room, then out into the hall. At the dance studio she paused, then entered. After a moment she stalked over to the stereo and pawed through the CD collection. Strange names stared back at her as she grabbed six at random and stuffed them into the changer. She pushed start and immediately the dark chords and ripping bass of goth and industrial music thundered through the room. It wrenched her into motion. She danced in flailing abandonment around the room as the dark beats soothed something savage in her depths.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Power flared and crackled along her nerves drawing her further and further into the dance until she snapped onto the Pattern. She danced herself into it, joining with it for moments at a time. It surged and ebbed in her blood as a tidal flood of raw energy. She danced until the music hit a crashing peak and finally released her. Spent, she collapsed to the floor as soothing flamenco washed over her from the Segovia disk she'd grabbed last.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the last guitar sounds faded she drifted back awake. Covered in dried sweat and shaking with fatigue she staggered into the bathroom and turned on the tub. She half climbed half fell into the rising water. Its warmth washed over her easing her into almost slumber. For once her thoughts remained strangely quiet as the tub slowly filled. She awoke as the water cooled to discomfort. Slowly drawing herself upright she pulled off her soaked clothes and dried off before stumbling upstairs to bed.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Hours later she awoke to the late afternoon sun streaming in through her windows. Throwing on a large shirt she prowled down to the study and called Merris. "Hey, I made it back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad. Was it ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't bad," she paused, not sure how to answer the unspoken question. "I...uh...I would have called sooner but I...ummm..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, it’s ok. You didn't have to call at all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wanted to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad." Something in Merris voice left her grinning like a fool as she signed off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She made her way to the kitchen and fixed herself dinner. She carried it out into the garden and ate slowly as the sun faded and the fireflies awoke.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Morning found her at the Adam and Eve for breakfast. "Jo, are there any places where they play goth or industrial kinds of music?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um...yeah...there's the Devil's Cathouse, it's in one of the empty industrial buildings across the river." She gave Kali the simple directions to it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart’s grin at the yards prompted an answering one before Kali even thought about it. "Had a good trip did you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I did."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They worked quietly until Kali was summoned to the com. She stuck her tongue out at Bart when she heard his, "Ah, the ritual continues..." She returned shortly with another silly grin on her face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, you going to be here tomorrow, or you going back up to the Portal?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll be here. Merris is coming down. She'll be here day after tomorrow by the time I'd normally leave," Kali replied without thinking and then blushed. "Gods, I'm so transparent. Laugh it up master mechanic," she added smiling through her blush.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart laughed and then turned serious. "I think it’s great. She needs to find the fun in life again. So do you, although you aren't as broody as you want me to believe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's that supposed to mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I mean you come in every morning looking haunted and pensive. As soon as you step through the door you're cutting up with the rest of us. When you're by yourself I get the idea you're thinking too much. Everything looks bleak until you are with friends, then you're happy again." Kali stared at him with a disbelieving look. "See? Now you're staring like I'm crazy. I've seen you come into the Adam and Eve trying to wear danger like a poorly fitting coat. I haven't known you long, but you don't have to pretend to it. You naturally ooze 'Don't Fuck With Me' more than anyone I know. Bravado got you to this shop, but 'don't fuck with me' has you holding your own against this bunch. Relax you're stronger and more dangerous than you think you are." He turned to return to work, pausing just long enough to add mischievously, "Besides, Merris likes you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smacked his arm with a barely hidden grin and a muttered, "You...I'll show you danger Mr. Mechanic."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah? You and what army?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Arg, that’s what. Just Arg. So there..." She stuck her tongue out at him again. "This is just so high school."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So why are you enjoying it then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe cause it’s more fun this time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the day seemed to alternately drag on for eternities or fly by. Merris wasn't arriving until the following day and she could barely wait so even the most exciting work seemed to drag. At last she was at a stopping point and could take her leave of the yards. At home she ended up making a simple dinner which she ate in the rooftop garden once again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a time she was content to watch the shifting patterns of light dance and fade in the garden. As twilight faded into night restlessness pulled her out of her chair and back into the flat. She thought about sleep until she realized she was too wound up to even try.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later she descended to the street and headed for the river bridge nearby. Her feet took her across and then threaded her through the shadows toward the crumbling industrial section of Death City. Following Jo's directions she slipped through the deep shadows to the abandoned areas where the Devil's Cathouse held residence in a disused building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A wall of sound spilled out the open doorway halfway down the dark alley. Drawn and repelled she hovered in the shadows. Slowly her feet drew her closer until she stopped at the edge of the last shadow. Swirling multi-colored light pulsed from the open doorway where several figures were clustered. She turned with the thought of fleeing back into the night until the opening beats of Eurydice by The Cruxshadows pounded into the night. Drawn in spite of her reluctance she slipped to the door and through it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside a high ceilinged room housed a busy club and bar. Fancy wallpaper and ornate lamps gave the room the aura of an old west cathouse. Lights and music pulsed from an open pit in the center where the heavy scarred wooden floor had been removed and the basement turned into the dance floor. The music was deafening even at bar level. It crashed through her head and soothed the raw edge of fear that was clawing at her mind. The sound pulled her around the tables and people to the stairs down. She stopped as she saw the maelstrom of swirling writhing bodies. The fear broke through then, driving her into a shadowed corner of the enormous bar that crouched near the side wall of the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finding a stool in the shadows near the far end she perched on it. Fear clawed its way up her throat as the press of people overpowered the call of the music. Looking around she noticed she was the only one not dressed in some type of exotic costume. She huddled deeper into the shadows, struggling between the desire to run and the enjoyment of the music. She was preparing to flee when Abney Park's Black Day wove through her head and drove the fear far enough back that she remained where she was.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What would you like?" A woman's voice pulled her out of her head. She was average height and dressed in a red peasant skirt and poet shirt. Gold glitter makeup highlighted her dark brown eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Totally distracted Kali replied with the first thing she saw on the board behind the bar, "Morphine Drip please." The woman raised an eyebrow and moved over to an elaborate contraption of glassware and tubing. Liquids bubbled and churned as the woman opened several stop-cocks. Fluids mixed and dripped into a waiting test tube. When it was half full the woman closed the valves, picked up the tube, and brought it back to Kali. "One Morphine Drip."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Carefully she accepted the tube and took a small sip. Complex flavors of butterscotch, rum, and almond flooded her mouth. "Wicked! Thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The woman smiled slightly as she replied, "Glad you like it. It's one of our specialties." She looked Kali over carefully. "Haven't come here before have you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. It's kind of obvious, I know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing to be ashamed of, just asking. It's just easier to let go with a costume."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Movement near her caused Kali to twitch her head around as Erick pushed his way up to the bar. "Hey Dementia, how about a Blood Wine?" He glanced over and smiled when he saw Kali. "Kali, hi! I didn't know you came here. Dementia, this is Kali, she's the one who saved my ass the other day."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, interesting name..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Deliberate, I'm afraid. I changed it shortly before I left the Realms."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks for saving his scrawny ass," Dementia continued.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No problems, I was in the neighborhood anyway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Erick made a show of looking down at his butt before saying, "Hey, it is not scrawny. Just in the neighborhood, huh?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, Kali, you ready for another? And yes it is honey."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled wickedly and replied, "Yes, I would like another."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, Erick, I'll start yours too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And shake it more than once this time. It's nasty when it isn't mixed well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia rolled her eyes and laughed as she moved back to the glassware. "Sure, sure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see you everywhere..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, you do seem to pick all my favorite hang-outs." Erick turned a bit more serious for a moment, "So, are you doing ok now? You didn't seem to feel so good about the rescue earlier."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I'm better."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once Dementia had an erlenmeyer flask full of deep red liquid she carefully put a rubber stopper in it and began shaking. She made a great show of walking over toward Erick and shaking it for a really long time before setting it in front of him with a flourish. "Try that. Remember the rules though. If you don't drink it, you wear it." She handed a new test tube to Kali as well, "Kali, here's yours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hooked another one, I see. That seems to be your most popular one so far."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is. Something seems to really work between the butterscotch and the amaretto."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How bad are these?" Kali asked as Dementia handed her the filled tube.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia laughed, "Oh, pretty bad. Mostly it's the 151 rum. I'd try not to do more than a couple an hour unless you've got a good tolerance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You going to sit here and swill those all night or did you come here to dance?" Erick prodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure why I came. I'm not really dressed right for here and..." Kali replied nervously.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're fine. Come, dance. I heard something about a newcomer that kicked ass the other night at the Adam and Eve."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali blushed furiously at his words but turned to consider the dance floor. Fear roiled up her throat as she saw the sea of moving bodies packed into it. People everywhere, pressing in, no safety, no space. Her breathing turned ragged as she fought the panic, desperate not to run and invite attention. She slammed her drink and gasped at the fire trail down her throat. Its burn snapped her out of panic and back to only unreasoning fear. Despair followed almost immediately as a lifetime of fear reached for control. Rage surged then. Red hot and pulsing it collided with the fear and the two fought as Kali drew deep shuddering breaths.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Erick and Dementia looked on in concern as a fog of black and red bands seethed and twisted around Kali. Erick backed up when he thought he saw claws momentarily flash into place on Kali's fingertips. Dementia started to raise her hand to motion for someone when the fog dissipated in a small puff of heat. Ice cold pale grey eyes stared out of Kali's face as she raised her head. "Come, dance with me." The words shimmered and flowed in the air, weaving a siren call to all within twenty feet of her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Erick turned enthralled to follow her. Others along the bar stood and followed in Kali's wake. Dementia stepped forward to follow as well and bumped into the bar. She looked around momentarily disoriented, "What just happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So intense was Kali that she didn't notice the entourage following her or how people moved out of her way as she stalked down to the dance floor. She threaded her way to a slightly less packed area of the floor and began to move. Unconsciously the crowd moved back to allow her the space her motions required. By the end of the fourth song the siren call of her voice had faded, leaving people looking about the dance floor, trying to remember when they had gotten there. The crowd slowly moved back in to fill the empty space around her. By the fifth song Erick had returned from his thrall and saw her eyes had finally returned to the warm grey he remembered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After the eighth fast song Erick gasped out, "How about we take a breather?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali grinned at him, "You go ahead, I'm not tired yet. Can't you feel the energy? Breathe it in!" She returned to the dance, lasting 6 more songs before she went to find him where he was sitting near the lower bar. As she approached she saw a familiar face behind the bar. "Hey, battle mage, didn't know you worked here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, warrior woman, what brings you in here? I'm Ennui by the way. We didn't get introduced in all the excitement."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Heya Ennui, I'm Kali, good to meet you. Great job on that defense screen in the tunnel. You really save our asses! The music brought me in," Kali answered. "Could I get another of those morphine things?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Morphine drip?" She nodded. "Sure, coming right up. Anything for you Erick?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm fine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As Ennui moved away Erick asked, "What happened earlier? You want to talk about it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A haunted look flickered across her face before she firmly answered, "No." He was about to push a little harder until he saw the ice demon in her eyes again. She slammed the rest of her drink, smiled a twisted smile, and asked, "You coming?" as she hurried back out onto the dance floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a moment Kali wondered what had happened to Erick until she saw he was still talking to Ennui. She turned and found a space on the dance floor and launched back into the music. Several sets later she threaded her way back to the bar again. When she noticed Erick wasn't there she waved for Ennui to come over. "Did you see where Erick went?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He headed out. Said it was getting late. Did you want another Morphine Drip?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh. Yeah, one more would be wicked, thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui handed the drink to Kali, turned to head down the bar and paused. Something made her turn back and say, "Erick's a nice guy..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali grinned at what she thought were the implications, "I'm not interested in him that way. He's yours as far as I'm concerned."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">That brought a smile and a blush to Ennui's face, "No, that's not what I meant."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was just wondering. He sometimes comes on a bit strong and I was wondering if he offended you or anything..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stared at Ennui in puzzlement, "I guess I'm confused now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He's just a good friend of mine and I just wanted to let you know he's not a bad guy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I got that part," Kali's tone was starting to cool considerably. "He's also fairly brave and a sensitive kind of guy in a lot of ways. I got that too... I guess I'm curious why you're taking the time to tell a relative stranger all this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cuz he's got the hots for you and I thought you should be warned. Erick latches on to anyone that seems interesting and it often annoys them. And...and I told him you are a Walker..." Kali's eyes turned ice grey as she regarded Ennui coldly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you did that why, exactly?" Her voice was deceptively quiet and intensely menacing, "Don't you think that's going just a bit far?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui nodded nervously but held her ground. "Yes, yes it is. I told him you were and I am. I told him to scare him away, or at least make him think. I told him so you wouldn't have to chase him away or hurt him. I didn't want him to go on about yet another crush. God, I don't know why it's so important to me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He's that good a friend then? That you'd risk the wrath of a stranger to protect him?" The ice gave way to a grudging respect. "I admire that." Kali commented as she sipped her drink. "What do you know of this Walker business?" She leaned across the bar again and said very quietly, "I can't get anyone here to answer many questions. Could you help me?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui remained silent a long time before replying, "I can try. I don't know how much I will be able to tell you though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything has to be better than nothing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm going to try and explain this to Erick tomorrow around noon. If you want you can drop by tomorrow as well and I'll tell you what I know. You can find us here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a date then." Kali finished her drink, stood, and headed back to the dance floor. As she turned she gave Ennui an almost warm smile and said, "Thank you." Kali danced herself almost to exhaustion, then slipped quietly out of the club.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once she reached the shadows of the night the adrenaline which had kept her moving and dancing finally fled. It left her leaning against a dark building on legs of rubber. Taking frequent breaks she made it to her building in twice the time it normally would have. The climb to her penthouse was torment. She stopped for long rests at every landing. At last she reached the comfort of her rooms. She took one look at the stairs to her bed and flopped down in the pillows of the sitting room instead. She instantly slid into dreamless sleep, waking hours later when she had to visit the bathroom.</p>


<p class="regtxt5"></p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The next morning she returned to Temple heath and started in on a newer diesel electric. This time Bart stood back and watched, often wondering over to check on other projects. Mid morning Kali let him know she was leaving for a couple of hours to talk to Ennui.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali walked in just as Ennui was saying, "That's just it Erick. It doesn't mean much of anything. We aren't different, just because we arrived differently. This is still a place away from the Realms and a place of healing. Just because we could go back doesn't mean we would want to. I don't understand why this is an issue with so many. Do I seem like the restless type?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, but is it really that simple?" Kali spoke from the door. "Sorry I'm late, I forgot to get directions last night for the open doors. I hope I'm not interrupting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali!" Erick visibly brightened as Ennui rolled her eyes. Kali noticed and grinned at her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do you mean that?" Ennui asked suspiciously.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just are you really that settled? Does it come with time? I, for one, am still restless and uneasy here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Give yourself time. Maybe Walkers are generally restless and maybe they aren't. Does it really matter? What if others are restless as well? Why should it get in the way of helping out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you know about Shadow Walkers and the rest?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want to know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How it works. What's the what of it all. The why's and the wherefore's..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui laughed at that. Kali's answering glare forced her to answer, "I don't know either. I'm still trying to figure out why me. Dementia's still trying to figure out why her and she's been here for decades. If you want answers you might have to go to an afterlife and then, I suspect, you'll only get the 'official' story based on that godling's view." Kali growled low in her throat, for a moment sounding like a large predatory cat. "I'm sorry. I want to help you, and myself, and Erick, but I don't know either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But haven't you gotten anything from being here? Anything at all?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe a little. Walkers seem to be the first choice for interacting with the Realms. Walkers make the best people to return the found items to the Realms time streams and things like that. Sometimes they are used as recruiters, but not always. That's about all I've found out. It has something to do with being more visible in the Realms or something like that. Maybe Merris, head of dispatch, knows something." Ennui added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She doesn't. I asked her a couple of days ago." Kali all but snarled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then I'm sorry but you know as much as I now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Argh!" Kali hissed in frustration. "That seems to be the story of this place. No one knows anything or wants to talk about anything... I never was interested in the new age-y way of thinking and here I am in a world a friend and I created..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Whoa, what do you mean by that?" Erick asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I read a story on the internet about this place and started writing to the person who had written it. We started collaborating on other stories about this world. Then after a thoroughly awful week this strange little tram showed up and offered me a ride. It dropped me off here...since then it's been an exercise in frustration trying to figure this place out..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that necessary? The figuring it out? Isn't it enough to be in a place where what you do matters? That was why I came along when offered, I wanted to do something more important than the bullshit of the Realms." Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, that's part of why I stayed, but I still want to know about how all this works. The part of me that was writing in this world before still wants to understand it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So here's one for you. Do you think you and your friend were making this up or channeling it from what existed?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ma..." Kali stopped abruptly, not sure what she wanted to believe now. "I don't know. I would have said making it up but it seems like it has life of its own. So maybe we were just seeing little pieces of the reality..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would that be so bad?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no I guess not... I've got to go, things to do..." Kali stood abruptly.</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">"So do I," Erick popped in. Kali strode back out into the morning sunshine. Erick followed close at her heals. "So, umm, what's it like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's what like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Being a Walker and all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali spun around and stared at him. "How should I know? That's what I've been trying to find out. What's it like being a dead person?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He stopped startled. "Uh, I don't feel dead.."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So that's what it's like to be a Walker. It doesn't feel any different than when I was walking around the Realms trying to survive life. What does feel different is how much nicer this place is. I don't have a suck-ass boss watching my every action, writing me up for bullshit like walking in late in the morning. It's like a wonderful dream that I am terrified will end unexpectedly and then I'll wake up back in the hell that was my life." Her eyes flashed cold fire as she said the last. Smitten, he just stared at her with awe in his eyes. "Now, I should get back to Temple Heath, I've got an engine waiting for me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She hurried away as he stared after her. Slowly he turned and headed back toward the club building. He thought of talking to Ennui, changed his mind, and headed back to his rooms instead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali returned to the locomotive she was working on. Her mind still unsettled by even more answerless questions. Bart found her later slumped in the control chair staring out into the shop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You ok? It's ok not to know what to do at first..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She replied with a tired smile. "Just thinking about all the questions I have that no one has answers to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Life doesn't have answers all the time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Isn't this the afterlife? Aren't you supposed to get the answers in the afterlife? Besides, the engineer in me is used to getting an idea of how something works. This is making me crazy. Mostly I'm afraid it will end and I'll be back in the Realms, bored out of my fucking mind. And now Erick is hitting on me besides. It was easier when I wasn't attractive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, this is an afterlife of a form, still doesn't mean there are answers," he smiled, getting a rueful grin from Kali in return. "You won't wake up back in the Realms. You're here until you decide to leave or until you die. That is a given. As for Erick, well, he is sort of a known problem. He chases everyone that is intense. He would have targeted you regardless after the rescue. You can ask Ennui about him. She probably knows him best of all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, maybe I'll talk to her. Guess, maybe I should get back to work, huh boss?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you think I'm paying you to sit here on your ass?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You aren't paying me..." Kali laughed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well, get back to work anyway!" Bart snarled through his grin. Kali turned back to the controller she had half disassembled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An hour later she was still staring at the schematics and mumbling to herself when Bart walked up again. She spared him only a short look when he asked, "You doing ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="settle_templedance"><a href="k_fp_sections.htm#fp_templedance">first person perspective</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. It isn't making any sense. I don't see anything that could cause the problems we are seeing." Kali pushed a hand through her tangled hair. "Damn it, what the fuck am I missing?" She muttered as she continued to stare at the drawings. Frustrated energy rolled off her in almost visible waves. "I'll be back," Kali said suddenly as she abruptly stood, stalked to the door, and out into the yards.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a few minutes Bart managed to ignore the strangeness, then curiosity took hold of him. He strode to the door and stepped out into the afternoon light. In the middle of an open space he saw Kali whirling in a breathtaking sequence of dance steps. The sunlight painted fiery highlights in the tangle of her hair. The baggy coverall she wore in no way hid the grace and sureness of her movements.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart stopped, transfixed. Behind him the door opened and Mark emerged, "Hey Bart..." his voice trailed to a stop. "Wow, is that..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, yes." For long minutes they stood and watched the strenuous routine going on in the yard. At last Bart shook himself loose and asked, "What did you need Mark?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh...uh, yeah..I need a second opinion on that diesel loco in bay three. Did you know she could do that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I'd heard she went to the Cathouse, but I didn't know she was a real dancer." They watched for a few minutes more before returning to the shop. "Don't say anything. I don't know how she'd take it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How she'd take it? Bart, she's taken everything we've thrown at her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, but she may be really sensitive about this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When she's that good?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're still new here. All of us have hurts from the Realms. I don't know if this is one of hers, so until we do, please leave it be."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mark looked skeptically at him before finally nodding assent. As he turned and headed into the shop he mumbled almost silently, "The Cathouse, hmmm..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later Kali slipped back through the door and glided back to the locomotive. Suddenly she was flipping through diagrams. Then with a muttered curse she darted into the storage area. "Hey Claire, where were those diagrams for the EMD locomotives again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Over here, in back of this cabinet," A dark brown haired head popped out from behind a large drawing cabinet to answer. The rest of Claire followed shortly. Her five foot three frame shorter than the large cabinet she had been working behind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked, thanks Claire." She slipped behind the other woman and scanned the drawers of another massive cabinet until she found the unit she needed. Kali grabbed the thick stack of electrical diagrams and hurried over to her bench. She shuffled through them until she found what she was looking for near the bottom of the stack. "Now I've got you!" She dashed back to the locomotive and started pulling even more access panels open.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She finished a little early and headed out. At the Adam and Eve she ordered a quick meal at the bar, ate, and left. Back at her apartment she walked to the dance studio, shoved CDs into the changer, and let them play. The music didn't pull her in like it had the first time. It felt distant and lifeless. She tried to spin into a dance routine but couldn't quite hit the groove. Half way through the first disk she gave up and stalked out of the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She prowled into the office and fired up the computer thinking to take her mind off things with a little surfing. Nothing caught her interest. Minutes later she leapt to her feet and paced to the stairs down. Her feet had her through the door, down, and headed for the Cathouse before she had made the conscious choice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She slowed as she reached the edge of the shadows near the door. She hesitated on the edge of turning away when a familiar song drifted into the night. It helped her from the shadows and through the door. For a moment she froze as the crowd inside came into view until the music shifted into driving beats and pounding notes. It throbbed in her blood and beat against her skin driving out the terror with wild energy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She dashed down the steps and launched into dance from the last steps. Riding the current of the music she whirled her way into the crowd. Sightless eyes failed to notice the attention her routine drew.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several songs later she drifted back to awareness and slipped toward the bar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Warrior woman," Ennui greeted her warmly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Battle mage," Kali returned. "Could I get water and a Morphine Drip?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Certainly. It'll be right up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Ennui returned with the drinks she said, "I'd like to talk to you a bit more, somewhere alone. Any way you can grab a few minutes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, just a minute." She slipped into the back for a few minutes and returned with a tall woman in a brown monk's robe trailing her. "Upstairs?" Kali nodded and Ennui waved her around the end of the bar. She grabbed her drinks and followed Ennui through the back way up to the private rooms above. Ennui motioned Kali into one of the comfortable chairs and settled into another one herself. Then she asked, "So?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali started abruptly. "Erick, I'd like you to tell me how to deal with Erick. He seems to think I'm interested in him. I'm not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't take this wrong ok? Erick falls in lust with any woman who shows intense reactions to anything. He latched onto you because you did what you did in the fight where he met you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So the next person that comes along will divert his attentions? Wicked awesome. Maybe I can find someone to do it sooner..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's how it works with Erick."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you interested in him?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not at all," Ennui answered with a bit of a laugh. "I already have someone. Someone unexpected...why am I telling you this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Because I have a friendly face?" Kali answered almost sarcastically.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why are you so prickly?" Ennui asked, momentarily stung.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali's eyes flashed as she stood and paced jerkily, "Because I'm terrified, ok?" She spun to stare at Ennui. "Look at me. This isn't me. I was..." she stopped before she blurted it all out. "..different... when I came here. A nebbish, an office slug with barely enough energy to walk home, a frightened mouse quaking at the shadows. Ugly, dumpy, something you wouldn't bother to notice on the streets." Ennui bit back a disbelieving statement as a hash laugh burst from Kali. Shaky hands pushed through her tangled hair. "Look at this," she said as she executed a perfect pirouette. "In the Realms I could barely walk without tripping and now..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't understand. Don't you want to dance?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, more than anything..." Kali said softly as she folded down to the floor. Her nervous energy momentarily stilled. "This is everything I've always wanted and I am so scared I'll lose it." Tears sprang into her eyes and spilled over. "Every time I got something I wanted in the Realms it was taken away. How can this be any different? HOW?!?" The nervous energy pulled her to her feet in a graceful spring. She half danced, half stalked around the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Lady isn't a proxy godling. She is not that cruel."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali slowed, eyes downcast, "My heart knows, I think. My head, I don't know, my head and heart never really talked, you know?" she replied half bitter, half sad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do they now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, no, maybe...I don't know. Gods," her hands pushed through her hair again as she stared up at the ceiling. "...I just wanted answers. This is the fucking afterlife and still there aren't any answers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What am I supposed to say?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. Fuck!" Kali dropped back into the chair and stared up at the ceiling again. Suddenly she asked, "How do you do it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Get comfortable here? Believe it is really real?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Give yourself time. It took me a while to believe it as well. Just go easy on yourself. It's a hell of a shock to come here. Maybe even more for us Walkers, I don't know. Those that die, well, they have to know at some level, even if they can deny it because they still have form. You, me, we came here, but we could go back. I don't know about you, but I'm scared I will be forced to go back and I'm scared because I don't want to go back, but I do too. There are people I wasn't ready to be done with and yet, if I go back, is it really me, or the me they knew anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hated it there. So many times I was so close to ending it. I want to stay here so badly and it always seemed like the more I wanted something the less likely it was to happen, or to last if it did. When I was young I prayed for visions, for a mission, a golden path to take me the fuck out of there. I even made up crazy stories that were more real to me than where I was. One day I realized they could never be more than just stories and most of me died." She paused and the pause stretched out into silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is real. Believe it. Believe the Lady. You more than most should know that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean me more than most?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She touched you, anyone with eyes can see that. Where do you think that raw energy of yours comes from? Who do you think changed you?" Ennui leaned forward, "Tell me, haven't you felt more alive, more yourself since you came here? She won't take that back. This dream is the true reality under the Realms."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe...maybe..." Kali sat forward and stared into the distance for long moments. Some of the crackling energy faded as she sat. When she looked at Ennui again her eyes were almost calm. She blushed bright red as she thought of the questions Bart had brought to mind. "Can I ask something..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You may..." Ennui answered uncertainly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali turned even more red as she stammered, "How do the biological things work here? Will I...will I...bleed...each month? Do I have to worry about...ah...about getting pregnant?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, you will still get periods here. You probably won't get PMS though. I used to get it bad some months, but I haven't here yet. Pregnancy, no. This is Death City after all. This is about healing and the like but it is not about new life."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, ok, thanks. I think I need to dance some more." Kali rose rapidly and headed toward the door. She practically ran down the stairs with confused fears and thoughts banging around in her head. The internal voice berated her for asking such telling questions while a second, more rational one, tried to calm her down. On the dance floor she found the darkest corner available and slid back into the music.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mark looked up startled as he saw Kali dash from behind the bar. His eyes followed her as she launched into a routine in a shadowed corner. For the rest of the night he watched as her body wove out patterns to every song DJ Davros spun. Once in a while she would take a break long enough to get a drink, but mostly she remained in motion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So wrapped up in trying to dance off all the nervous energy that filled her she completely missed the stares of people wondering how she could keep going for so long.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">DJ Davros wound down near two in the morning. Mark led the applause that greeted her as she gracefully bowed to Davros. Face flaming she ran into the night, not stopping until she was safely in the shadows. Panting and shaking she leaned against a closed door and tried to slow her frantic heart. Once the shakes stopped she made her way home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the safety of her flat she stared at her reflection in the bathroom mirror. "Why were you so afraid? Why did you run?" she asked the face staring back at her. The face stared silently back. Long moments later she slowly stripped off the flight suit and turned on the shower.</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">She slid into Temple Heath later than usual the next morning. Avoiding as many people as she could she returned to the servo systems in the locomotive. She had just slipped under the main panel when a small cough intruded. She slid out to find Mark standing nervously in the doorway. "I, umm, I want to apologize for last night. I didn't mean to embarrass you or to be cruel in any way. It's just you are such an incredible dancer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fear constricted her heart from the attention, but a tiny blossom of pride was there as well. For just a second it felt really good to be appreciated. "Thank..." she swallowed hard and tried again, "Thank you. I...I uh I'm sorry it rattled me so badly." Silently she cursed the nervousness that had turned her face flaming red again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once she has finished the servo system repairs she rose, grabbed the large stack of plans and headed back to the storage rooms. She was setting the drawings back in place when Claire called, "Hey dancer-lady, how are you today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali spun, face flaming again. "What?" she mumbled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I saw you at the Cathouse last night. Very nice moves by the way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, uh, thanks. I'm fine, I guess..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, if I'd tried to dance that long I would still be flat out in bed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, oh," Still flustered, Kali turned back to putting away her drawings. Claire stared at her for a moment longer then turned to return to the shop. "Uh Claire..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes?" Claire turned back to Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, I was wondering where I could find something better to wear there," Kali replied, chewing on her bottom lip nervously.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's a couple of places in town here. There're some in Goth City, up the line towards Portal Station that are even better." Claire continued after a brief pause, "We could go shopping sometime if you'd like..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like that," Kali replied with a shy smile. "Maybe tomorrow after we're done here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cool, it'll be a blast."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the day passed even more slowly for Kali. Late in the afternoon the shop door opened and Merris stepped inside. She scanned the room until she found Kali and Bart working on a locomotive in one of the far bays.</p>
<br/>
<p class="pagecaption">Of Dance and Danger</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly she walked over. She stood uncertainly until Kali noticed her. "Hey, I made it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, so you did." For a few more moments they stood shyly looking at each other until Kali grinned and said, "Fuck it." She strode over and swept Merris into a hug. Bart started clapping as they backed away from each other their faces bright red in the lights of the shop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Merris, good to see you down here in the real world again," Bart teased gently.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I'm not at Portal Station," Merris answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you would consider that the real world?" Bart asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. Wouldn't you?" Merris looked actually puzzled before a huge grin split her face. "So Kali, you done here or should I come back later?" Merris asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Go, take Merris out and show her the real world. I think that rarified air up there near the Portal is addling her brains."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Be careful there master mechanic. I might just need to send you on a really long recovery mission. Never know when you might be needed..." Merris replied evilly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart just grinned and waved them away. "Go on now. I wouldn't ok any locomotives or rolling stock for such a trip."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, that's kind of a laugh. I haven't been here long enough to know what to show you." Kali muttered as Merris led the way out of Temple Heath.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wouldn't worry about it. Going to the Adam and Eve for dinner and then staying and listening to the Temple Heath regulars would be a wonderful evening. It would take my mind off the latest in a long series of dangerous extractions. Everything turned out all right, but it was close for a little bit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They had settled down, gotten food and drink, and were relaxing when the rest of the Temple Heath crowd meandered in. "And this is your definition of showing her the town?" Bart prodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's in town and she is seeing it, so yes," Kali replied grinning. "We require sustenance before walking about and all the rest, lest we grow faint with hunger and lack of good drink. And there is all this quality companionship. How could we refuse such a boon as this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fancy words miss newcomer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just because I fix things doesn't mean I can't talk all pretty. So sit, eat, and drink with us then and I'll shut up." And the rowdy Temple Heath regulars settled in for another night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The table looked up when Allen called, "Hey, over here. Don't be strangers, come join us!" Dementia and Ennui were just settling down at a table of their own.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia shook her head as Bart chimed in, "Come on over Dementia. I haven't seen much of you these past months. I'd think you had a new partner or something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia and Ennui blushed deep red as they slowly rose and walked to the Temple Heath table. "As a matter of fact I do. Bart, you remember Ennui don't you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He smiled brightly, "Of course I do! Good to see you again. I'm glad you get along with her. She does better when she's not alone." He stopped when he saw Dementia looking uncomfortable. "Sit and be welcome with us." He turned and waved at the table, "This is the Temple Heath regulars. Merris I'm sure you know..." He added, waving to where Merris sat next to Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The stories and conversation continued rough and rowdy long into the night. Ennui and Dementia faded shortly after they finished their meals. The gap left in conversation by their departure was rapidly filled as glasses were refilled and the stories continued. It was nearly 0100 when Kali and Merris staggered up the stairs to Kali's flat. After a few words of goodnight and several glasses of water they collapsed into their beds, Kali up in her bedroom and Merris in a nest of pillows in the sitting room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali woke suddenly an hour later. Energy zipped and fizzed through her like worms wriggling under her skin. The sheet was sandpaper on her exposed legs and arms. Nerves screamed with the need to move. For a while she fought with it. Just when her eyes would start to close her heart would suddenly pound and the wriggling would start up again. Unconscious tension made her joints ache and burn while the pounding of her blood made her hands and feet feel bloated and stiff.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Half an hour later she gave up and jumped out of bed. Silently she danced around her room. Harder and harder she pushed until sweat rolled off her, until her lungs and muscles burned. Still the energy crackled and sizzled in her veins. Frantically she pushed even harder, striving to move faster, stretch farther, and leap higher. Muscles screamed, her lungs sucked huge gulps of air down her raw throat, her vision dimmed with the pumping of her heart until, at last, the energy fled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She dropped like a marionette with cut strings and lay spent on the floor. Her muscles were still twitching and spasming as a tousled head appeared on the stairs. "Are you ok? I heard a thump a minute ago." Merris asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali tried to sit up but her muscles wouldn't do it. "Couldn't sleep," she whispered through her raw throat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So you stood up and fell over?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very funny. I was dancing if you must know." Her face burned at the admission. Part of her couldn't understand why she should feel ashamed, but she did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you fell? The bed is better for resting than the floor." Merris asked, concerned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can't. Please help, too weak to move."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Too weak? How long have you been going?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Started at 0200. Kept going until I couldn't anymore." Kali answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"0200? That was 3 hours ago. And you've been dancing since then? Until you fell?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Didn't fall. Ran out of energy. Help, please." Merris gently helped Kali up and walked her back to the bed. She lifted her legs up and tucked the blankets in around her. "Thank you," Kali said softly, her eyes already sliding toward sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No worries. Why are you embarrassed to dance?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ugly, clumsy, useless," Kali answered half asleep. Merris's sharp inhalation started her awake. Her eyes shot open as she turned bright red. "Forget I said that!" her voice was urgent and strained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a long moment Merris hesitated, staring into the raw fear in Kali's eyes, before replying, "I will, but you aren't. I don't believe you ever were." She stared sadly down at Kali until she saw her eyes close again. Softly she crept from the room, back to her nest of pillows where she lay awake for a very long time.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali was up early with the faintest hint of the worms under her skin again. She slipped quietly into the sitting room and watched Merris sleep for a few long moments before turning to the bathroom for a shower. When she emerged in her sleep T-shirt and hair in a towel Merris blinked sleepily at her. "You should still be sleeping."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Couldn't. This burning restless energy has been building for a few days. It's been letting me sleep less and less of late, although it's kept me going on less sleep than I'm used to as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Adaptation reaction. Everyone that arrives here has something that is completely out of balance for weeks to months after arrival. It'll calm down. It'll just take some time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Great."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could be worse. It looks like you have something that works, as long as you try not to fall down when you're done." Merris added through a grin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled back through her sudden blush. "You want anything to eat? Or you can go back to sleep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I'm awake. Coffee would be great, maybe food too. Give me a minute and I'll help." Kali headed toward the kitchen while Merris hurried to the toilet. A few minutes later she joined Kali in the kitchen where she started creating an omelet while Kali started the coffee.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris gave Kali a long hug when she left for Temple Heath and explained she had to return to Portal Station fairly early in the day. "I'm afraid I won't be able to stay much past noon. Come see me when you can."</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey Bart, is Kali up there with you?" It was near mid day when Claire's voice floated down to Kali where she was working under the locomotive.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No," Bart replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm over here," Kali answered at the same time. She climbed out of the pit and stood. "Merris, hey," she added shyly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey yourself," Merris said, smiling. "Kali, this is Anastasia. She heads up the extraction team. I told her you were wanting to join up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hi," Anastasia held out a hand while she looked Kali over. She was tall, with a dancer's body. Her face was angular and striking, framed by a riotous tangle of dark red hair, pulled back and tied with a wide leather strip. Her grey eyes were warm, like autumn sunlight on gathering clouds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hi." Kali took the hand briefly after wiping hers on her coveralls. She stared back at Anastasia. She was a bit shorter than Kali or Merris. Her blonde dyed hair was cut short. Her eyes were ringed in black and she wore black lipstick as well. It made her already pale complexion look washed out. She was muscular and self contained, meeting Kali's stare easily.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They looked at each other for a long moment before Anastasia asked, "What has Merris told you about extractions?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much more than I found out for myself. They are dangerous and unpredictable. Also, that I don't have to sign up forever if I freak out. What can you add?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much additional either. Dementia, from the Devil's Cathouse, gets visions which help quite a bit. When she has them they are quite accurate. There is a core team of eight of us that have been doing this since almost the beginning, a little over a year ago." Anastasia looked closely at Kali, "I heard about your mission with Sammi and Jemima. Are you willing to go into battle with the same ferocity next time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia noticed the haunted look pass over Kali's features. "I don't know." She answered honestly. "It still disturbs me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stared deep into Kali's eyes for a long moment. Within she saw an unsettledness. Behind the somewhat cautious look a shadow paced in it's cage. When it detected her stare it turned and looked out at her. In that instant she knew Kali would be fine. "I think you have nothing to worry about. I would be honored to have you on my team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stared back into Anastasia's face. Pain and worry lurked just below the surface. "Thank you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll leave you two to work out the details. I need to talk to Bart then I'm headed back to Portal Station." Merris said as she turned to find Bart.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali grabbed her in a large hug, held on for a moment, then released her. "See you later!" Once Merris had gone Kali asked, "How does this work? Is it like a volunteer fire department where I come and live at the station during my shift?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, nothing quite like that. You get a com unit that has the channels for my team. You agree to keep it with you when you are available and you let me know when you want to turn it off. If you decide to quit, you give it back. When a mission is called, I contact the team over the com units and we gather at Central Station. When everyone is there, we go. I have to warn you though, we don't have the best of equipment for this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I saw that when I went out with Sammi and Jemima."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right, sorry about that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No problem. I don't mind the introductory speech now that I've seen one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's about it really. I am in charge. Follow the lead of the other team members until you figure out your strengths, and try to stay alive. So far we haven't lost anybody..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you are worried about that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, considering what happened to you, and that rescue team, I am very worried."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Count me in, if you'll have me," Kali said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome!" Anastasia smiled. "Here is the com," Anastasia placed a small com unit in Kali's hand. "It'll signal when there is a mission. We have a small group of rooms in the back of Central Station. It's mostly to hold what gear we have and give us a place to meet and plan. If you could come by tomorrow around lunch time it would be great. I can introduce you to the rest of the team and assign you some basic equipment. Sound good?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good by me. Thanks!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart followed her back to the pit. "Extractions? Are you sure? After our conversation the other day..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I'm not sure. I know I crave the excitement though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You realize that will more than compensate for your being here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure I understand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The everyone should contribute guideline of Eternia. If you are doing extractions then you are more than carrying your weight. You don't need to keep working here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you telling me to go away?" Kali asked, hurt by the thought of being asked to leave.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not at all. Just if you end up with too much happening, it's ok to let this go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, because I like being here and I don't want to have to stop coming in. Do extractions really happen that often?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There have been more and more of them. There weren't any at all until about a year ago. Since then the danger has just kept increasing. You be careful. We would all be very unhappy if you were hurt or killed doing this."</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">/* this also has a <a href="k_fp_sections.htm#fp_shop">first person</a> section */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">That evening, after leaving Temple Heath, Claire led the way into a section of town that Kali hadn't seen yet. Narrow cobbled streets twisted their way between wood framed stone and brick buildings. Soft guitar music drifted from a passage to a courtyard. The smell of coffe drifted out. Claire walked past a door, then windows displaying black corsets, leather and lace dresses, and heavy boots glittering with buckles and zippers. "Here we are, best Gothic fashion shop in all of Death City." Claire commented as she opened the far doorinto the shop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali followed her into the store and slowed as the familiar brain freeze crept forward when confronted with the vast array of styles. All the times in the Realms of looking at fashions for women smaller than her crashed in on her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali?" Claire asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't even know where to start." Kali answered, lost. A lifetime of nerves and frustration sought to drive her out of the store to the safety of the street. She started to turn to the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire looked at Kali in disbelief, wondering how she could have survived. Then she tried to explain, "I try to start with an idea. Focus on a look you like and try it. That way I only grab a few items at a time to try. Once you have a few items, try them on and see how they look."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stood motionless for long moments as she tried to decide whether to say anything else. Finally she stared around the room, picked a rack of black corset styled crushed velvet tops with large puffy upper sleaves, and picked several sizes off it. Slowly she made her way to a dressing room. Inside she slipped off the upper portion of her flight suit and tested the various sizes until she found the closest one. Lacing up the black laces in the purple front panels she turned to survey the result. She was surprised at how good it looked. Heartened, she hurriedly tied the flight suit arms around her waist, as a make-shift belt, and went in search of a suitable bottom component.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire stared at her judiciously when she walked by. "Um, Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Claire?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The colors are good for you, but you don't really have enough up here," she motioned toward her chest, "for that style to work very well. The sleeves detract from you." She walked over to a different rack and motioned, "Try these instead. They shouldn't overpower you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I couldn't wear anything that short and skimpy!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire just smiled and asked, "What size is that?" When Kali told her, she grabbed the small top and pulled Kali back to the dressing room. "Off with that one." Kali turned bright red, but untied the top and slipped it off. "Ok, first off, loose the sports bra. It might be fine for working at Temple Heath, but it isn't doing you any favors here." She stood impatiently until Kali reluctantly pulled it off, turning an even brighter shade of red as she did so. "You need to find some really nice bras, and you're really lucky, with that set you won't need much support, so the sky's the limit on your choices. Next, with abs like that, you should be showing them off." She pushed the other top into Kali's hands, "Slip that on and you'll see what I'm saying."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali eyed it with suspicion and asked, "Laces to the back, I'm hoping." Claire nodded, trying desperately not to laugh. Kali slipped it over her head and tried to settle it into place. The thin elastic laces pinched, her abs felt draftly, and her breasts unsupported. She squirmed around, trying to get it to feel better.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire reached over, pulled on the back laces a couple of times, shifted the front fabric, and stepped back. "Take a look at that. See what I mean by showing it off? Didn't you ever dress to impress in the Realms?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali shook her head, "I didn't want to be noticed or hit on. Baggy and shapeless was what I wanted. I don't know if you remember how I looked when I first arrived, but I wasn't much to look at."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You were pretty then, too. You could have had your pick of partners with just a little effort."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked down and away, biting her tongue to not disagree. "I'd like to try a few more things on. Would that be ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Within a few minutes she was modeling various combinations for Claire and commenting on Claire's choices. By the time she settled on several outfits, including the top Claire had suggested, she was enjoying herself. She dropped her flight suit in the bags with her other choices and wore her last selections, a long black peasant dress and the small top under a black, long tailed, tuxedo coat. They thanked the shop owner for the creations and stepped outside. "Dinner? We could go somewhere other than the Adam and Eve tonight," Claire asked. Nerves hit Kali as she felt the draftiness of a skirt. It had been a long time since she had worn anything other than pants and the airiness seemed extremely vulnerable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, is there something wicked around here?" She replied in as even a voice as she could.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked?" Claire didn't respond to the nervousness in Kali's voice, only to the strange term she had used.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, interesting, exceptional, fun?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh. Yes, there's this great Armenian cafe just down the block from here. Or there is a good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirogi">pirozhki</a> kitchen a little farther down."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirogi">Pirozhki</a> sound good. I haven't had them in a long time." Kali answered. Claire led the way into the long, narrow shop. A wide walkway went from the door to the counter at the back of the shop where a large older woman waited to take their orders. On the wall to the left were various paintings of forests, horse carts, peasant farmers in bright colored clothes, and a wooden hut with a thatched roof dancing around on chicken legs. To the right was a long display case with many different types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirogi">pirozhki</a> inside. They each selected several different types to try, then made their way back out to find a nearby table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali sat with her back closest to the buildings and Claire settled in next to her. They talked of easy things, Temple Heath, the Devil's Cathouse, food, and trains while they ate. When they were finished Claire asked, "Cathouse?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I want to go back to my place for a few minutes first. I'd like to change my look a bit and drop off the rest of my stuff." Kali replied. Her nerves kept her distracted enough that she didn't see Claire brighten up at the destination.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali led the way once they were back near the cathedral. She showed Claire to the sitting room before heading up to her bedroom. Swiftly she changed into grey leggings and a pixie skirt, immediately feeling less vulnerable in something with less draft. "Do you want to leave your stuff here?" She asked as she came back down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, thanks. I live at the Cathouse. I'll just take it with me." Claire made a show of looking around. "Nice place you have here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I liked it when I found it," Kali smiled. "Ready?" She asked as she hurried to the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire paused for a moment like she was going to say something. When she saw Kali disappearing down the stairs she hurried after her. "In a hurry?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sort of. I need to dance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Need to?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Need to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where did you learn? I've been taking lessons ever since I got here and I'm still not very good."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I just knew how to once I was here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh wow!" When Kali saw the adoration in Claire's eyes she started walking even faster. Within days of arrival and already three people were interested in her. For a second she thought about running back home, locking the doors, and never coming out. The scurrying energy in her nerves kept her headed toward the Cathouse. Claire had to almost run to keep up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside the Cathouse Kali almost ran for the dance floor, leaving Claire to make her own way to her room. Once she started dancing Kali started to feel better. The music let her forget about the chaotic thoughts bouncing in her head. After several sets she slid through the crowd to the bar. Ennui glanced up, saw her, and made her way over. "Warrior woman, I approve of the new look." Her smile was appreciation without pressure. "Morphine Drip and water?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes please." Kali smiled back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Conversation later?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't, but you looked a bit spooked when you dashed onto the floor. Like two nights ago kind of."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, still a lot on my mind. I need to dance for a while longer first. And I don't have to bother you if you'd rather I didn't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok. Come get me when you're ready." Kali downed the rest of her drink and returned to the dance floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Near midnight she returned to the bar. The Monk had replaced Ennui. "Can I get you anything? Ennui said you can go up any time, if you still want to talk with her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Morphine Drip and water please." Kali sat and sipped the drink after slamming the water. When the test tube was empty she asked for a second one, sipped it even more slowly than the first, and wondered what she would say to Ennui. For a long time she worried whether she should even bother her with more questions. She stared at the second empty Morphine Drip, sighed, and slipped around the end of the bar. The Monk just nodded as she headed back into the private areas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly she climbed the stairs to the top floor. Outside Ennui's door she hesitated for a long time before starting to turn away. "Were you looking for Ennui? I think she's in." Dementia said as she came up the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not really sure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia stared at her for a long time before saying, "You should come in." She opened the door and motioned for Kali to precede her. Slowly she walked in and stood nervously as Dementia closed the door. Ennui was curled up in a large chair, reading a book. Dementia crossed to her and gave her a quick kiss. Kali turned away embarrassed and looked out the nearest window.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are troubled," Ennui began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Always," Kali replied bitterly. The chaos she had burned away dancing returned in full force. "I'm doing it again. Not even here a month and I'm doing it again." Dementia and Ennui silently watched Kali pace, waiting for her to continue. "I don't want to be attached and I do. When I get attached to someone I hide myself to be what they want. Why do I do that?" Again the other two let the silence stretch out. Almost against her will Kali spoke to fill the void. "They won't like me if they know me. Knowledge is power and every bit of information someone has on me is another weapon they can turn against me. Merris intrigues me, yet I didn't tell her I had been dancing here. We could have come over last night. Instead I tried to sleep, couldn't, and ended up dancing in my room anyway. When she asked about it I was so embarrassed to tell her. This drives me crazy, this shame over everything I do." Ennui drew breath to say something but stopped when Dementia shook her head. A twisted smile curled Kali's lips when she continued, "I always try to attach to someone. That way I don't have to be as pro-active in what I do. But over time I start to resent them for that. It's not really their fault, but... the resentment is still there. I fear doing the same thing with Merris. And Erick is interested, and now Claire, and the gods alone know who else. Why can't I stop talking? Why am I telling you all this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why don't you tell us?" Dementia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali tried to stop talking then, but it twisted inside her until she had to blurt it out. "I'm so sick of hiding. I can't stand what I've been. I want to be more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want to be?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Me," Kali answered with solid conviction. "I want to know what I am, who I am, whether there is anything left under all the masks I have hidden behind. I can't seem to hide here. I have become...things...done things, gotten... abilities...that are needed. I like to be needed but I don't want to be responsible and being needed means being responsible. I'll just screw it up and then where will everyone be? I don't want my actions to impact others and what I am now, well, it could impact so many."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You didn't have to go on that rescue. What prompted you to?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wanted some excitement. Then I didn't want to die. Then..." Kali stopped abruptly. not wanting to admit what she had told Bart.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something about that scared you, didn't it? Was it the danger? Was it that other people died?" Dementia asked. "Or did you enjoy it?" Kali's shudder told her everything even as she tried to remain silent. "You enjoyed it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just like with Bart the words clawed their own way out of Kali. "I didn't want to. There were screams, blood, and I dealt death, so much death..." Even now she could see the torn flesh and ichor on her hands, smell the horrible odors. Unbidden the killer slid forward to stare about the room. Ennui edged back in her chair but Dementia remained calm, watching her. "Yesss," It came out in a weird purr, "I enjoyed it. The ultimate dance, the dance of life and death. There is not one without the other. And I was so alive with it!" Terrified Kali scrambled back to the wall and slid down it, hands pressed hard into her eyes, trying to drive the beast back. "Ahhyyiii," escaped in a long shuddering gasp. "No, no...I don't want to be this...."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are scared you will be a killer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia's analytical words brought her head up. "I don't want to be a killer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You killed them to save us. It has always been this way. There is no shame in saving your friends." Ennui added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I enjoyed it!" Kali shrieked in agony. "I fucking enjoyed it and I want to do it again! It itches and crawls under my skin. The craving for that intensity of feeling."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you want to kill me? How about Ennui, or Bart, or the Temple Heath gang? Is there anyone in Eternia you want to attack right now?" Dementia pressed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Gods, no!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then maybe you are scared of the wrong things," Dementia finished. It wasn't much, but a small knot loosened a bit at her words. "You were touched by the Lady when you arrived. Were you like this in the Realms?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not at all..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then might it not be a gift of hers? And if it is, might there not be a reason, a purpose? You said you wanted to be useful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You dance it away don't you?" Ennui asked. "The crazy energy?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With a thump the pieces fell into place. "Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then keep dancing." She said it as if it were the simplest thing in the world. "So many haven't found an outlet for what eats at them. Allow yourself yours. You deserve it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui missed the twitch that caused but Dementia didn't. It drove Kali to her feet as the fear driven energy sizzled along raw nerves. She turned to go. "And dance I feel the need to do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia reached the door before Kali did. Her calm eyes held Kali's wild ones with total immovability. "Running won't make it better. You deserve better than you allow yourself. Your wants are as important as everyone else's. Think about that as you drive yourself to exhaustion." She stepped aside and opened the door as terror propelled Kali into a run. She leapt almost from landing to landing as the headlong rush tumbled her down the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ear splitting and flesh pounding sound crashed into Kali as she ran onto the dance floor. Energy flew from her in shimmering sheets driving the rest of the club goers into a frenzy of motion only slightly slower than her own. The DJ picked up on it as well and kept the music hard and insistent for the next hour. Dancers dropped in droves until Kali was the last one still in motion when closing time neared.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the last song faded into silence Kali staggered to the bar and collapsed onto a stool. "Water, please," she croaked out when the Monk asked. Silently she handed her a pint glass and set a full pitcher next to it. She slammed the first glass and immediately filled another one. She downed two more before rising slowly. "Home, headed home now," she said through her raw throat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stumbled to her flat. She pulled off her boots and fell back onto the bed. For a few minutes sleep claimed her. Then the nightmares started. Shadows chased her through dark hallways. Claws reached for her. She jerked awake. Energy burned fire through her nerves again. Desperately she flailed back into motion, dancing around her room until she couldn't focus, until her limbs would barely move. Every time she sat down the fire surged again, driving her back into motion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She staggered and fell. Still the fire pulled her upright and back into the dance. She fell again and struggled on the floor, still trying to get back into motion. She dragged herself to the bed and pulled herself upright once more. Her motions had become spastic and frantic, still she couldn't stop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once more she fell. This time she made it half way to her feet before her strength gave out and she fell back. The blankets she clutched fell back on top of her. She rolled and tried to get up on all fours. Instead she collapsed into unconsciousness with the blankets tangled around her.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Sunlight streaming in through the east windows woke Kali from the dreamless sleep she had fallen into. Muscles screamed in protest as she tried to move. Slowly she fumbled into a bent over posture, looking more like an eighty year old woman than herself. She half stumbled and half fell down the stairs to the bathroom. Her face appeared grey in the mirror. The skin under her eyes was blue-black and bruised looking. Bloodshot eyes peered from under lids that wouldn't climb past half open.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A long hot shower allowed her to straighten up and repaired a bit of the exhaustion damage to her face. She turned toward the kitchen but the thought of food brought burning nausea. She climbed slowly back to her bedroom, donned a flight suit, and headed out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Temple Heath was already bustling with activity when she pushed her way through the door. She had just eased herself into the pit to continue the traction motor project from the day before when Bart strode up. One look at her face and his smile dissolved into concern. "Are you sure you want to be here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. It's better than being alone right now." Her voice was still raw and hoarse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything you feel like talking about?" Bart asked as he sat down at the edge of the pit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I was talking to Ennui and Dementia last night..." she trailed off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good people, those two."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah..." she smiled faintly. "It's the same. So many changes that I don't know what to do with. I need to think about some of them, but when I do, it makes me crazy." She hadn't even noticed she had started pacing. "And so much energy. Its burning up my nerves. I can't stop moving for long. Last night I couldn't sleep until I was so exhausted I couldn't stand. Yet the sun woke me this morning. In a few minutes I'll probably run from here and out into the yard because I won't be able to just be still."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Adaptation reaction..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, that's what Ennui said. Last night I danced until I fell to the floor and couldn't get up again. And still I wanted to keep moving. How long does this go on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It just depends. For some, it ends quickly, for others, months. Erick for example was months while mine was a couple of weeks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Great, I am so comforted," Kali replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At least you aren't being a total bitch to everyone around you. It's easier to know that you'll go dance in the yard when it gets bad, rather than wondering when you'll scream obscenities at someone again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"More than once I'm afraid." Kali had stopped pacing and had sunk down on her haunches. She had her head leaned against the side of the pit. "Are you sure you don't want to go sleep?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can't," she muttered as she looked away from him. "Nightmares," she whispered. Slowly she pushed herself erect. "I'm ok. I'd like to get back to fixing this now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart looked at her as she resolutely picked up her tools. "Ok, but let me know if you need anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned haunted eyes back to him, "I will. Thank you."</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, are you there? We're off to get lunch. You want to come?" Bart's voice slowly penetrated the fog around her. Slowly her head rose from the wires she had been staring at for a very long time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I think so." She fell in with the rest of the lunch crowd. For once she wasn't part of the chattering, playful group. Instead she trudged along behind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The small diner was located just outside the Temple Heath yards. Inside the table tops and counter were worn through in spots from years of polishing and cleaning. The smell of fryer grease, coffee, and onions lay beneath the fresher aromas of the daily specials. As a block they filed over to the large booth in the back and shuffled in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lilly, the usual waitress, came over with a first round of coffees and water. Without a word she slid them in front of the regulars. "What'll it be today? The usuals?" Almost everyone nodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali almost didn't speak fast enough. Lilly had already started to turn away. "Not today. I'd like the Sunrise burger with everything please. Medium, fried onions, with the bacon and blue cheese. Hash browns with hot sauce and catsup, salad with honey mustard. Thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lilly, eyes twinkling, asked, "Need any mustard or mayo? Thought you got it all, didn't you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali grinned up at her, "Closer than I've ever gotten before. Mustard and mayo would be great, and a large battery acid."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, so part of the usual then, the bottomless glass of grapefruit juice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, unless you want to bring a pitcher?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll just keep it full like always."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In short order the food started to arrive. Kali's plate was one of the last. She dug in immediately. The warm food filled the empty void left from little sleep and less food. She was just finishing the potatoes when a strange warbling chirp sounded near the table. It took her several moments to realize it was coming from her pocket. She hauled the com from Anastasia out of her pocket and shoved the headset over her ear. "Yes?"</p>

<a NAME="shredded"></a>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is Anastasia. You ready to go out? We have a call."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali hesitated for a moment before replying, "Yes. I am near Temple Heath. Should I come to Central Station?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you cross the bridge and head down the platform 10 siding we can pick you up along there. That way you won't have to come all the way in to the station if we get started before you arrive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know how long the mission is?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Twelve hours at the most. The original mission was supposed to run for 18 hours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali shut off the com and turned to Bart. "That was quick. An extraction call already."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Conversations started around the table as the surprise settled in. Bart's question cut over the top of the others, "Are you sure you want to take this one?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali hesitated, uncertain herself, before answering, "Yes, I do." She rose before her fears could root her in place. "I'll be back in tomorrow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart's eyes followed her as she turned to go. She almost didn't hear his mumbled, "Be careful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The train picked her up just after she passed the platform ten switch. Anastasia showed her in to the rest of the group where they were scattered in a lounge section of the meeting car. She rattled off the names of the other seven team members. Alisha was her unofficial second, Lauren was a battle mage, Lissa was a mage in training, Natalya handled explosives and other demolition duties, Anton and Mark were fighters, and Danny was the medic. They greeted Kali warmly and mentioned having already heard about her previous mission.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alisha began going over the routine they followed when on an extraction. Kali tried to listen, but kept drifting in and out from lack of sleep. After the fourth time she stopped Alisha with, "I'm sorry. I didn't sleep well and I'm missing what you are telling me. Could I maybe nap till Portal Station and then we can try again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alisha tried to cover her annoyance and replied as calmly as possible, "Ok, but this is important."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And that is why I'd like to give it more attention than I am able to this moment." Kali leaned back and let her eyes droop closed. Sleep did not come, but neither did full wakefulness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was still drifting when the train slowed to a stop at Portal Station. Anastasia and Alisha went in to Dispatch for the latest data on the mission. Once they returned Anastasia spread maps and papers out on a large table. She motioned everyone to gather around and began detailing the situation. "This was a twelve hour mission. We have the fastest routing so we should be arriving in about an hour and a half. The world is not being destroyed, only the section where the team went in. There are four target areas and..." Kali drifted back out as Anastasia continued the briefing. The last image she saw was the main map in the center of the table. It shifted and morphed into a three dimensional modeling as she faded out. She scanned it as her view pulled back to see more of the area. To one side was a tiny train, pulled up neatly on a stretch of track. Tiny figures moved along the roads and paths, splitting into groups and scattering throughout the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Underneath a building near the train a red point blossomed. Anastasia's voice cut through and it faded rapidly. "Kali, did you have any questions?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Without hearing Kali laid a finger on the map and said, "They will come through here." She looked up to see everyone staring at her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you hear anything I said?" Anastasia asked. She put her own finger on the map at a place farther away. "All our experience shows they will come through here. Near the main group."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, they will come through here," Kali responded, tapping her location. "This gets them in between the train and the teams. They can cut off their escape and kill them as they return."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do you know that?" Alisha asked with thinly veiled antagonism.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's what I would do. Separate them, attack from full advantage, and leave no survivors." Danny hissed in surprise while the rest of the crew stared at her, shock and unease visible on their faces.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's not how the opposition behaves."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They will this time," Kali replied with conviction.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alisha drew breath to speak when Anastasia overrode her. "Alisha, take the team and head for where we expect the attack. Kali and I will be along in a moment." She waited until the rest of the team was out the door before rounding on Kali. "What did I tell you? Follow along and see how we work. What do you think you are doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They will come through here. I am certain. Look, I will go there. If I'm wrong, call me when the attack happens. If I call you, please come and help." Kali stood and started toward the exit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you are wrong, I expect you to follow the team from now on."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If I am wrong, I will." Kali strode off the train and into the drizzle. It clung to her hair and dripped down her flight suit. Distant sirens echoed through the dimly lit streets, echoing off the dark, empty buildings towering over her, scraping the leaden sky. She vaguely remembered Anastasia saying this section of the city was going to be hit with an earthquake an hour after the regular mission was scheduled to finish. For a moment she breathed in the empty sadness before hurrying to the building she had seen and stepping inside. It was a lower building, reduced mostly to rubble by an early quake. She carefully picked her way across rain slicked debris and crept to a set of shattered stairs. Slowly she eased her way down them into the dark basement below. The air was cold and damp. Fallen places in the floor above provided patches of light and pools to avoid. She slipped along until she came to the opening she had seen, where the foundation had slumped away into a dark pit. There was no sound except for the dripping of rain from above.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, how are you doing?" Anastasia's voice called from the com.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am in place and waiting. Any sign at your location yet?" Kali shivered slightly in the shadows, cold now that she was no longer moving.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. The data from Dispatch indicates any time now though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A faint popping sound drifted up from the pit in front of Kali. Dim reddish light flickered in the distance, then settled into a dim glowing disk. Grey figures boiled out. "They're here. Do you have any there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How many?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ten so far and more coming through a gate of some kind."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're coming. Fall back and wait."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As Kali watched more figures piled out of the gate as the first ones slid silently across the pit toward the slope up to her. In her mind she saw the maps again. If they reached the surface there was no good place to hold them back. "Anastasia, pull the recovery missions back to the train. I can't wait. If they get out of here, there is no place to hold them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, you wait!" Anastasia commanded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali waited until the first wave was just starting their climb up to her, then she launched herself into the foe.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, no!" Anastasia screamed when the sounds of fighting reached her. Kali vaguely heard her calling orders to the others as she ripped into the first creatures. Claws raked and swiped past her. Everything contracted down as she danced into the opposition.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several blocks away Anastasia issued rapid orders to the rest of the team. Alisha, Lissa, Anton, and Mark hurried to round up the rescue teams. Anastasia, Lauren, Natalya, and Danny ran back toward Kali's location. They stumbled across the debris and hurried down the steps. Sounds of battle reached them as they neared the break in the foundations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Down in the pit Kali swirled in a mad dance among the grey beings. Lauren fired a light spell into the ceiling. White light poured down over a scene of chaos. Claws raked and whistled past Kali's moving form. Numbers allowed several to land blows, leaving tracks of red and torn cloth in their wake. Strips of her torn boiler suit began to tangle in her movements. A quick twist gained her enough space to slash the top fragments loose from the bottom. She flung the shredded remains from her and into a tangle of attacking forms. They dropped back long enough for her to claw the bottom parts away from her legs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lauren started dropping ones on the edge with her magic while Anastasia rushed forward to help Kali. When she got closer she saw Kali spin and rip the last remains of her boiler suit from her body. She danced on in only a black thong, sports bra, and her heavy leather boots. Bluish ichor and bits of grey flesh clung to her. Here and there splashes of red revealed slashes and cuts. Muscles rippled and flowed in hypnotic fluid motion under her tanned skin. Her feet danced from stone rubble onto dead grey things and back to the stone without her even noticing. The grey things fought with claws and long knives. Kali fought with her hands and feet. Heavy boots crushed skulls and curved talon-like hands ripped oozing chunks from them. Her hair flew loose in a wild curtain behind her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stifled a scream as one being grabbled the flying bundle of Kali's hair. Kali spun with the pull and dropped the creature without a sign of discomfort. When she saw Anastasia she smiled a terrible smile and waved her on. Her voice drifted through the screams, clear and warm, "Come, dance with me. There is plenty for all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lauren eased around until she could see the pulsing red mouth of the gate. Swiftly she worked on a counter spell. A grey being ran for her, sensing her intent. Natalya swung her rifle up and rapidly pumped several rounds into it. It dropped at Lauren's feet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Moments later her spell sped into the gate and snapped it closed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia fought on the edges, accounting for a small number of the remaining foe. Lauren had dropped another small percentage. Kali brought down the rest. By the time she was finished Anastasia was looking on with a mixture of fascination and terror. Kali stood in the center of the carnage, head and arms raised high, mouthing some sort of silent chant. For a flickering instant Anastasia thought she saw something else standing there until Kali dropped her head and arms back down and picked her way carefully over the corpses. She stopped in front of Anastasia and seemed to shiver. Wild energy bled off her, leaving a startled woman looking out through troubled eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui was right, warrior woman," Anastasia whispered softly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So much, so much death," Kali replied softly. Her haunted eyes took in the large pile of corpses. She shivered in the dank building. Her eyes drifted down to take in her appearance. "When did...oh, right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have a spare set of clothes at the train." Anastasia gently took Kali's hand and started to lead her away. Kali followed without protest. The others looked on in surprise as Kali calmly walked past them with no sign of discomfort at her state of undress.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The last of the battle frenzy and adrenaline faded as Kali followed Anastasia through the rain. Greyish blue ichor mixed with oozing red to form slow rivers of purple across Kali's skin. Cold slowly seeped in to replace the heat from the battle. Fatigue caused the images of the buildings around her to waver and shimmer. For a moment she saw flickering lights, slowly moving figures, and scattered vehicles moving along the road.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A looming dark building to her left caught her eye. With a quick twist she pulled away from Anastasia and jogged toward the dark doors. "Kali, wait!" Anastasia yelled. Kali kept going, nimbly dodging through a group of recovery workers hurrying for their train. Just before she reached the doors she spun and jumped. Her feet slammed into the glass, shattering it with a crash. She slipped into the deeper darkness within while Anastasia ran to catch up. Her light played over the interior as Kali strode toward a desk at the back of the entry.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time Anastasia stepped through the broken door Kali was at the far end of the room, scanning the wall behind the security desk. She was muttering as she moved her hands over the panels until she stopped at one. "In here. We need to go down." Her voice took on an odd, disconnected quality as she continued, "It's here...what they wanted. We were...secondary. We need to get down there quickly!" Her hands started scrabbling at the wall, as if she could claw her way through by force of will alone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Natalya, explosives. I need you in the large brooding building near our train. I'm flashing my light toward the street. Anyone else close, we need recovery tools, stat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Natalya jogged up and spread out her equipment. "What is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali placed her hands against the wall. "Through here. There is a shaft. I need into it." Natalya looked at Anastasia. She hesitated a moment, then nodded in agreement. Silently Natalya started placing explosives.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone back. Fire in the hole." They ducked behind the desk as the shaped charges did their work. Kali bent and pulled the buckles loose on her boots, kicked them off, and darted through the dust to the hole. "Light." Mark tossed her a high power head lamp as he raced into the building. "Bring equipment, quickly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali twisted into the shaft and began climbing down. Her hands and feet grabbed rebar, old form wires, and other bits and pieces as she climbed down. Anastasia rushed forward and shoved her head through the opening. Kali was already twenty feet below her and still headed down. "Mark, get a rope in place. You and I are following her down. Kali," she called into the com.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Will we need explosives?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Natalya, you come too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali passed fifty feet and kept descending. Her hands and feet started to cramp. At eighty feet her arms were trembling and her vision blurred. At ninety feet she stopped and edged over to a heavy door. Using her clawed nails she carefully worked the pins loose from the opening mechanism. The rope dropped down behind her as she struggled to open the doors. Slowly they edged open.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia was half way down when she saw Kali roll forward into a corridor. She swarmed down the rope as quickly as she could. The corridor stretched off empty in front of her. She flashed her light around, finding only Kali's bloody foot prints running down the corridor and turning left at the first opportunity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Running now, Anastasia spun around the corner and followed the tracks deeper into the basements. She passed several shredded grey bodies as she followed Kali's trail deeper down the cold, white corridors. No doors marred the walls. Far ahead a soft glow of light came from a passage to the right. At the end of it Kali was carefully feeling around the edges of a large vault door. She spun as Anastasia ran up. "Tools, I need tools. We haven't much time. Whatever the opposition wanted, it's in here!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The others are right behind me. Are you ok?" Anastasia took in the slowly widening blood smears under Kali's feet. Her wounds still oozed blood and she was shivering slightly in the cold.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," she answered, distracted, as she turned back to the door. "Here, this is where we pry." Her fingers curled slightly into a faint lip at the edge of the door. "Bar," she called as Mark came around the corner. He once again soundlessly tossed her the requested item. Kali shoved it into the faint crack and pushed. She shook as fatigued muscles refused to give her any power. "Help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mark threw his weight against the bar. It began to edge outward as Anastasia added her strength. Natalya took a second bar and added her effort. The door eased out slowly. Revealed in the widening opening was a crushed body. It had wedged between the door and the locking system, preventing the last security measures from sealing down the large lab space behind it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali darted into the opening, sketching a slight bow to the corpse, and softly saying, "Thank you." She reverently stepped over the remains and into the large space. Strange equipment lined the walls and littered long benches. Moving in trance-like slow motion she pivoted slowly and started toward the bench farthest from the door. "These are what we want."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia looked down at the oddly shaped rifle like devices Kali was pointing at. Six of them lay in a neat row on the bench top. "Mark, Natalya, grab these."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still moving in slow motion Kali stepped over to a bulky object on another work surface. She pulled it to her and picked it up. "This too. It contains data. We need to damage this equipment before we go." Her eyes grew distant, "The second wave is coming soon. They want this very badly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nat, charges, now," Anastasia commanded. "Mark, you get going with those. Anton, where are you?" Natalya began pulling small blocks of explosives from her pack. Swiftly she began setting them around the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Near a shaft in the building Mark ran into," his voice came through filled with static.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anyone with you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lissa and Alisha aren't too far away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bring Lissa with you. Come on down the rope. We need your help. Follow the bloody footprints until you find us. Kali, lets go. Nat, how're you doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bloody footprints?" Anton asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't ask. Just hurry."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Another five minutes." Natalya had scattered blocks of explosives strategically around the room. She was inserting detonators and connecting wires as she replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anton and Lissa hurried in a moment later. "Here," Anastasia said. "Grab some of those weird weapons from Mark and start back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali pushed the strange box toward Anastasia. "Take this. Mark, a weapon please." She caught the weapon as it flew toward her. She spun to face a the far corner of the room. "Natalya, they're almost here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, ok, just two more connections." Her fingers flew as she twisted and pulled at the connections. She stood quickly and pulled a small item from her pocket. She twisted the mass of wires onto two terminals, flipped a small switch, then set it carefully on the floor. "I'm ready, let's go!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Go, run! I'll be right behind you. Natalya, detonate when you reach the shaft." Kali yelled as she slowly backed toward the door. Anastasia stopped for a moment until Kali glared at her, then she turned and ran for the door. In the hallway the rest of the team was already rounding the first corner.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stopped at the rope and turned to look for Kali. She slid around the corner just as a deep whump sounded from behind her. The pressure wave from the explosion threw her forward into the floor. The strange weapon flew from her hands, clattered across the floor, and skidded to a stop a couple of feet from Anastasia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia ran back and hauled Kali upright. Her skin was icy to the touch and her eyes were glazed. "I've got you. Let's go." She pulled her along, stopping only long enough to grab the weapon. "Anton, Mark, I'm tying Kali on the rope. Pull her up at my signal. Lissa, drop me another rope." Her hands swiftly tied Kali into a harness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stas, tie yourself on as well. We have enough people up here to pull both of you up and you can keep Kali from bumping the walls." Anastasia quickly complied and sent the message. She crawled up the wall as they were pulled up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Boots," Kali mumbled as Anastasia half carried her toward the exit from the building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Someone, grab the boots by the desk," Anastasia called back. "Allen, be ready to leave when we get to the train. Did the rescue mission leave yet?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes the other train left already. I am ready as soon as you are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia  led Kali directly to the sleeper car and to the shower. She spun the water on, adjusted it to barely warm, and pushed Kali into it. She slid down the small space until she was almost sitting on the floor of it. Her frame was just a bit too long so she ended up wedged in. "Rinse off. I'll be right back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali sat half conscious under the water. The stinging pain of water on new cuts and scratches, dull, throbbing pain from over worked muscles and joints, and shooting pain from the bruises and cuts on her feet brought her slowly back to awareness. She fumbled around, trying to rise and get the worst of the mess off herself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia returned with large towels and a heavy blanket. She helped Kali stand and pulled the last of her clothing off. She gently patted her dry and started to wrap the blanket around her. "No, I'm still bleeding."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It will wash out. You need to get warm." Anastasia wrapped the blanket tightly around Kali and held her close. Carefully she walked them back to her compartment, eased Kali back onto the bed and activated several emergency heat packs. She placed them around Kali and then covered her with a second blanket. Kali gradually stopped shaking as warmth seeped in slowly, easing the reaction and the chill. Her eyes drifted closed. "Danny, could you come to my room with your med gear? Kali needs looking after. Allen, take us out of here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm on my way." Danny replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are out of here," Allen answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you for showing me a wonderful time," Kali whispered through a soft smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stared at her, wondering what Kali had meant with the strange statement. She looked up as Lauren entered and asked, "How is she? That was incredible, what she did. I had heard the stories, but, wow..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I know. I wonder what price she pays though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The price who pays?" Danny asked as he entered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali," Anastasia answered. "She's naked under there, just so you know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He settled down near the bed. "Thanks for the warning. Kali, I'm going to look at your injuries now, if that's ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok," she answered quietly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny pulled the blanket back in sections, working on small areas of exposed skin at all times. He applied bandages and butterfly strips as needed. When he saw her feet he hissed in surprise. "She was walking on these?" Anastasia nodded silently. "Ouch!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That bad?" Kali asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should stay off your feet for a few days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That bad?" she asked again, a little more forcefully.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You cut the shit out of them, so yes, I'm afraid so. What did you do, walk through broken glass?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Among other things, yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really? Or are you just being a brat?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really." She flashed him a wicked grin. Then her eyes drooped again. Exhaustion masked the pain from the claw marks on her back and sides enough for sleep to almost win.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, everyone out. My patient needs some rest." Danny backed slowly out of the room and closed the door behind him. Kali slid down into sleep.</p>
<br/>
<p class="pagecaption">Of Dance and Danger 2</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty minutes later her eyes snapped open. With a groan she tossed and turned on the bed. Everything hurt. The bed was hard and lumpy. The blankets scratched and irritated her skin. Her cuts ached and muscles cramped. Grumbling she hoisted herself out of the bed. Pain shot through her feet as she placed them on the floor. She focused on them until she could stand the pain, slowly placing more weight on them until she was standing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The room was tiny. There was a small cubby desk and chair near the window. A closet and set of drawers were wedged in between the desk and the corridor wall. The fold down bed took up the other side wall. There was enough space to stand and maybe turn around between the bed and the cabinets.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Muscles screamed and protested until she moved. The movement seemed to help somehow. She did a couple of warm ups in the tiny space of the room. Her hand hit the wall when she tried to expand her motion. Snarling in frustration she stepped to the tiny clothes closet. Inside she found a scoop neck top that hung loosely on her frame but still didn't quite come to her waist. A ratty pair of jeans fit poorly, hanging low on her hips and ending above her ankles. For a moment she stopped in embarrassment, then gave a sharp laugh. The last outfit had shown the team more of her than the ill-fitting clothing did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali opened the door to the narrow corridor and made her way toward the communal car. She heard voices raised in argument as she neared the common room. "She's a loose cannon." Alisha was saying.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But her instincts are true. The opposition would have kicked our asses if she hadn't known where they were coming in." Anastasia countered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She doesn't listen and she doesn't follow instructions. I can't protect her if I don't know what she will do next. You saw it yourself when she ran off into that other building."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I never asked you to protect me," Kali said quietly from the doorway. Alisha turned red and looked away. Anastasia looked up in surprise. Lauren, Lissa, and Mark looked up from their card game.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aren't you supposed to be sleeping and staying off your feet?" Anastasia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can't." Kali padded across the floor to an empty area and began to run through various routines. It took her only a moment to adjust to the slickness of the bandages on her feet before she was moving at full speed. Anastasia and the others watched her in silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What the hell are you doing?" Danny's voice blasted from the other corridor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dancing," Kali replied as she finished a pirouette.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'll tear things open."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This feels better than being still." She locked her toes tight and spun up onto their tips and kept going back down, making a mental note to not try toe stands barefoot in the future.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You need to stop now." Danny said again when he noticed the fresh red stains on the bandages on her feet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can't," she said again as she dropped back down onto the balls of her feet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're hurting yourself this way. You have to stop." Danny reached for her but she danced away from him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't. Adaptation reaction won't let me stay still. It's this or tear my skin off to stop the burning in my nerves."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny stopped and backed away from her. "At least promise me you'll let me check your injuries when you can stop." She nodded once. He joined Anastasia at her table and sat in silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali continued dancing until she neared exhaustion. She collapsed in the nearest chair, not wanting to fall down in front of the others. Pain from her torn up back forced her to sit away from the chair back. The restless fire sped in warm waves through her, but not quite intense enough to force her back to her feet. When Danny started toward her she pulled the top up, intending to take it off until she saw Anton turn red. She stopped with the hem half way up the under slope of her breasts and let Danny check the bandages. "I need to check your legs too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She dropped her top and stood. "I don't have a room."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stas, may we use yours?" Danny asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Use the empty one next to mine. I was going to assign it to Kali anyway." Anastasia replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They walked off down the corridor, crossed to the living car, and entered the compartment. Kali skinned out of her jeans and stood shameless in front of Danny. "Not modest I see. That makes it easier."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"First time ever I like how I look. Besides, I could rip your throat out before you could do anything wrong to me." Danny looked just a bit nervous until he saw she was smiling.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bandages on her legs showed no new blood spotting either. She sat back on the bench and presented her feet. Danny unwrapped them and stared. Fresh blood had spotted them yet the wounds looked sealed and in good shape. "Ok, I guess it hasn't hurt you to be dancing. Doesn't it hurt to be on your feet like that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled and pulled the jeans back on. "Not as much as laying under the covers did. I just feel beter when I'm in motion."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Make sure you eat right and sleep. How are you sleeping by the way?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Badly, if at all, the last couple of days. Before that I was doing fine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If it keeps up for more than a day or two longer, I'll find you something to help. How about eating? Any changes in your cycles?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks. I'm doing ok with eating. Cycles are fine," she added, blushing bright red. " Anything else? I might be able to sleep a bit more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. I'll grab you one of those blankets from Anastasia's room." Kali eased onto the bed and closed her eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is your problem anyway?" Alisha asked from the doorway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My problem? And what exactly do you mean by that?" Kali asked from the bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have your own agenda. How can you think you are part of this team when you go off on your own? You endangered all of us with those stunts of yours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I endangered myself. You were still the same team you were before I came along. I made a decision based on what I thought."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you were right. So now you want to gloat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked at her with a puzzled expression. "Is that what you think? Would it help you to know I wanted to be wrong?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If I had been wrong it would mean the opposition wasn't getting more dangerous and nasty. I wanted to be made the fool."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Whatever," Alisha snarled as she walked away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry, she usually isn't like that," Danny stated as he gently placed the blanket over Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not even sure what I did to her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alisha's a control freak. It's what makes her a good second, but she expects things to be done a certain way. So far you haven't exactly fit that ideal."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Try not to worry about it for now. You'll find your place and she'll get used to you. Now, try to sleep. It's still two and a half hours back to Death City." Kali pulled the blanket around herself and let her eyes drifted closed.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Fifteen minutes later Kali's eyes snapped back open. With a snarled curse she flung herself out of bed. Frustration rolled off her in waves as she stalked to the lounge and flung herself into motion. Alisha started to say something to her but backed quickly out of the way when she saw the icy rage in Kali's grey eyes. She remained in motion until the train came to a stop at platform ten in Central Station. She continued when Anastasia asked, "Coming by tomorrow? I can show you our areas here and get you equipment for the next time. Ask anyone near the station. They can tell you how to find me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I plan to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was wondering about something you said earlier. You may not even remember it, but you said something about showing you a good time. What did you mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had a good time." Anastasia just stared at her in disbelief. "Seriously. The danger has a purity I have rarely experienced. I know it sounds crazy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, it does. There is nothing fun about that kind of terror."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you do this then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"These people are my friends. I want to keep them safe and I'm good at making that happen. If someone else could do it better, I'd step down in a heartbeat." Once more the tiredness was plainly visible in Anastasia's eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have a good team there. Surely one of them..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"None of them could lead. Alisha is too rigid. No one else would be willing to try. No, I need to keep the team going and hope a new truce comes soon. Are you going to keep dancing all night? You really should rest."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, but I can't stop quite yet. I'll leave when I can. Shouldn't be much longer." Anastasia almost missed the muttered, "I hope," at the end of Kali's reply.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Long after Anastasia had gone Kali finally stumbled off the train. Danny saw her as he was coming out of the station offices. "You need a hand getting home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stumbled again as she was about to say no. Instead she nodded her head slowly. They walked in silence with Danny catching her when she would stumble or fade. "May I come in?" Danny asked when they reached her door. "I'd like to check your bandages one more time." Kali stood for a moment, then nodded again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside she stripped off Anastasia's clothes, dropping them in a pile at the door to the sitting room, and let Danny check her over. "Looking really good, considering. You should eat something though. You lost a lot of blood."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She made a face and shook her head violently. "Only if you want me to puke all over you. You can sleep in the pillows if you like. I'm hoping for thirty minutes sleep instead of twenty." She managed a ghost of a smile as she pulled herself up the stairs to her bedroom. She was so tired she didn't feel his eyes track her all the way up the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny gave his head a shake, muttered, "Out of your league Danny-boy," and walked over to the mound of pillows. He pulled and poked them into a comfortable arrangement and flopped down. He was asleep in moments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Upstairs Kali fell back onto her bed and stared up at the canopy. Random images of the day chased around and around. She rolled toward the edge of the bed, planning to get up and go talk to Dementia. Instead her eyes sank closed and she tumbled into sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Two hours later Kali jerked upright in bed. Fire chased along her nerves once more. Groaning in frustration she levered herself out of bed and carefully dragged on a flight suit. It was the only thing she could think of that was loose enough not to rub her wounds. She reached for her boots, then picked them up rather than pull them on. Slowly she eased her weight onto her feet. Like on the train, they hurt for the first few minutes, but rapidly toughened up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Downstairs she paused long enough to check on Danny. He was curled up in a nest of pillows. His face relaxed into boyish cuteness. For a moment he looked like a delicious treat wrapped up and waiting to be sampled. Kali shook her head in a sharp shake. Boys and cute. That was an entirely new idea. One she wasn't sure she wanted to consider very deeply.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She padded down the entry stairs on bare feet. At the bottom she sank onto the steps long enough to pull on socks and boots. Outside she quickly made her way to the Cathouse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two hours after Kali launched herself onto the dance floor she made her way back up to the main floor. At the bar she waved Dementia over, "A Morphine Drip please." When Dementia returned with the drink she added, "Do you have a few minutes later?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In half an hour or so, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I kind of need your help with some more questions," Kali started out apologetically.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"More questions, why am I not surprised? But don't you want to talk to Ennui instead?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"These are about seeing things."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh. How about I come and get you when I'm ready for a break? Will you be here or downstairs?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Downstairs. I'll watch for you. Thank you!" Kali took the last of her drink and returned to the dance floor. She left the empty tube at the bar and returned to dancing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Forty minutes later she spotted Dementia as she came down the stairs. She slipped over to intercept her and together they made their way around the bar. Dementia led the way up to her flat and settled into a chair. She took in Kali's pallor and the dark circles under her eyes. "Are you seeing things that are keeping you awake?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, that would be the adaptation reaction. I still can't stay still for very long. I think the two hours of sleep I got right after the extraction mission was the most I've gotten in the last two days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then what are you seeing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I went on an extraction earlier."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I heard several people talking about it. Something about an almost naked warrior woman taking on the opposition single handed," Dementia laughed at Kali's deep blush. "I'm sorry."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No you're not! Besides, their claws are sharp. They wrecked my clothes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"True, I'm not sorry. But for all your talk of shadows, you don't manage to stay in them very well, do you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled ruefully, "No, not any more. Anyway, I was drowsing, from lack of sleep, when we headed out. Next thing I was seeing the extraction site, complete with little figures moving through it. And if that wasn't strange enough I also saw where the opposition was going to strike from. How is that even possible?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know how it works. It just does. It started for me when I hit puberty. Is this the first time for you, or did you see things in the Realms as well?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This extraction was the first time," Kali paused. "Maybe not..." she continued slowly. Incidents returned to her, most were just vague feelings, but in each case the feelings had been true. "There was once I remember, I was in college and driving with a partner. Something told me not to go at a turn. I ignored it and another car blew through a stop sign and smashed into me. There were others, just not as definite as that. And a few where it felt like something might have happened if things had changed even a slight bit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have an understanding of it then. That's the way it works for me. Once I arrived here it all started to intensify. Now I see entire sequences, whole events. I can walk onto a rescue world and see the events that led up to the destruction. Unfortunately in full surround sight, sound, and smell." Dementia shuddered at the memories.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't that complete for me. I just saw personnel placements and arrival points. Then I saw the target of the opposition's efforts for that world. It wasn't until I actually found the target location that I saw what was desired."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You caused quite a stir in Anastasia's group from what I heard tonight."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I guess. I couldn't just ignore what I saw. I had to be sure it wasn't real and when it was... How often do you see things that don't happen? How reliable is this likely to be for me, assuming it even happens again? In the Realms about half the time the impressions never happened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In the Realms mine were like yours, some would happen and some wouldn't. Here I have been right every time. They change if the sequence of events is modified, but, left without interference, they will play out as I see them, always."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey Kali," Ennui called from the door. "I thought you'd be sleeping after the mission. I hear you've been busy again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No shadows for me anymore," Kali responded bitterly. "Who's been talking? I thought everyone else would be resting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Natalya came in for a little while earlier. She was talking about a weapons cache and how you knew right where to go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's seeing things," Dementia commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is she passing out, getting headaches, or other side effects?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not that she's said. It sounds more like movements and placements rather than full on visions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, she hasn't noticed side effects yet, thank you," Kali replied. "And she's still in the room."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, right," Dementia grinned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will be leaving soon though. I'm needing to dance again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is it the rage stuff you mentioned last time?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think so. The last few days I keep getting too much energy. If I don't dance it off it keeps building until I want to claw myself apart."</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali staggered into her flat at 0400. She slipped off her boots inside her entry door and padded up into her flat. In the bathroom she stared at her reflection for a long time. "Stripping down in front of a guy. What were you thinking? And finding guys cute? When did that  start?" she asked the silent reflection. No answer came back. "Talking to myself in the mirror again. How special is that? Haven't done that since the Realms."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny was still asleep in the pillows when Kali took a quick look. Back in her bedroom she changed into a large T-shirt and fell into bed. Sleep claimed her rapidly for a change.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Sunlight woke Kali two hours later. Everything hurt when she moved. She stifled a moan as she eased out of bed. As she moved the pain slowly decreased to dull, throbbing aches. Downstairs she heard the shower start. She pulled on a thong under her T-shirt and slowly padded down to start coffee. Early morning sunlight filtered into the kitchen and bounced off the hanging pots, throwing sparks of gold everywhere. The ivy shown vivid green in the warm light. Kali stood for a moment and admired the painting like quality of the room before fixing the coffee.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The maker was just finishing when Danny walked in. He was still toweling his hair and making sniffing noises as he followed the fresh scent of coffee. "Ah, a goddess stands before me. She offers up the water of life at this unholy hour of dawn. Yet her feet must be of clay for she neglected to close the drapes and thus deprived me of long morning slumber."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cute Danny, real cute," Kali tried to sound mad but she couldn't stop the snicker.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Might I repay you by preparing an offertory repast?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You may." Danny bustled around the kitchen, assembling various items into a large omelet and seasoned potatoes. He brushed off Kali's offers to help. "Go, sit, if you can. I still want you off your feet." Obediently she perched on a stool and watched.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ten minutes later he placed a small serving in front of her and motioned for her to taste it. "Excellent. Your offering is accepted as a fair trade for the water of life." Kali dished up two large plate fulls and fell upon hers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And what are your plans for the day?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Temple Heath after this. Anastasia and I have an appointment at noon. Probably dancing at the Devil's Cathouse tonight. And yours?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Check your wounds one last time, since I'm here and can. Then restock the med kit on the extraction train and hope for no calls." Danny started water in the sink and reached for the dish soap.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can leave those. I'll do them later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to do them now. I wouldn't feel right leaving you with them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You cooked, that means you shouldn't have to clean up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad you feel that way. If this happens again I'll keep it in mind for then," Danny replied as he washed and dried. "You are on the injured list and I want you to stay there while I finish these." He worked on in silence while Kali dutifully remained perched on her stool. "There, now, if I could see your injuries, feet first?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali lifted her feet and presented them to Danny. He looked, then moved closer. Gently he poked at the balls of her right foot. "Does that hurt at all?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not really. Why? Is something wrong?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure yet." He turned her foot to get more light on it and pushed against her heel. "How about that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It tickles a little and feels a bit like you're pushing through heavy cloth."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've seen some people here adapt in somewhat interesting ways. Looks like you might be one. Take a look at your feet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali pulled her foot up until she could see the underside. Thick darkish pads covered the balls, toe tips, and heel of her foot, making it look like a cross between a human foot and a cat paw. When she poked at the pads it felt cushioned and spongy. "Okay..." She said slowly. "Is this dangerous? Will it spread? I'm not going to morph into a cat or anything, am I? I was getting used to looking like I am now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, you shouldn't. You might need new footwear though," Danny grinned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stepped down on her feet and did a couple of quick turns and jumps. "Wow, this will make dancing so much easier." She leapt into the air and landed on the balls of her feet. She felt very little jarring in her knees, feet, and ankles. "This is wicked fucking awesome!" She spun in place without any of the sticky, grabbing feel of human skin on floor. "Oh yeah!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Before you get too carried away, I'd like to see the others as well." Kali pulled her shirt off. Danny gave the wounds a quick look and said, "These are looking quite good." Kali slipped her shirt back on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How does healing work here? In the Realms I healed very slowly and scarred easily. I think my skin didn't like me much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's not all that uncommon of a problem. Here it just depends on the mind of the person. Some heal very rapidly, sometimes within days. Others take a more Realms style length of time. I've heard it's a bit different for the Shadow Walkers, but I don't know for certain about that. You seem to be one of the fast healing people from what I'm seeing with these injuries."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And the scarring?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Time will tell, but right now it looks like you won't have that any more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something perverse in Kali's mind remembered his blush as she stripped off her shirt. "So, did you like what you saw?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny turned bright red, thinking of how part of his motive was to get her shirt off again, "I may be a medic but I'm not dead. Ok, I am dead but I'm not dead dead. A beautiful woman still registers." He looked away from her and mumbled, "I'd make a play for you, it's just I think it would be rude right now. But when you're healthy and adaptation reaction is over, I'll be interested until you tell me to stop."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She bit back the half hysteric reply that tried to force its way out. Instead she smiled a tight smile and tried to breath out the tension locking her muscles. "I need to get moving. The energy is building again." She dashed upstairs and hurriedly dressed. "Off to Temple Heath. You can hang around here for a while if you like."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I think I'll finish cleaning up breakfast, then head out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outside the morning air felt cool against her flushed skin. She breathed in large breaths to try and still the pounding of her heart. She was calmer by the time she reached Temple Heath. Although she did take ten minutes to run through a few sequences in the yards before venturing to the door and stepping in. She had started toward Bart's office when he waved to her from near Shergar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And the legend of Kali continues to grow," he greeted as she walked up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not my fault, boss."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And whose would it be then? Lauren came in and was talking to Claire and Erick last night. Seems she needed to decompress before heading home after the mission. Our shadow walking woman doesn't seem to stay in the shadows much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh gods, not Erick. Shit!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, well, he might not be so much of a problem. Lauren did mention you taking Danny home with you. That cooled Erick right down. Then Mark came in looking for Lauren and mentioned her efforts. Erick might be off on another target now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Danny helped me home. That's all. He slept downstairs. Nothing Happened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Whoa, whoa, I'm not your parents. It wouldn't matter if something had happened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I don't want anything to happen yet. Do you have something you want me to work on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart stared at her for a moment, then replied, "I'd like you to check out another servo system. She's an EMD SD70M series and she's waiting outside. We don't have room for her inside right now. Let me know if you need a bay with a pit. I'm hoping it's something cab side. Remember, I'm here if you want to talk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know that. Seems like all I do is talk though. I'm not sure if it's helping much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It might take some time before you notice the benefit. Now are you going to stand here talking all day or are you going to get to work?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Work, yes indeed, right you are." Kali headed to the drawing storage for the necessary drawings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire looked up as she entered. "Welcome back. Sounds like you had an intense time of it yesterday. You doing ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your medic check you out this morning?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't like that. He just saw me home and crashed on the pillows in the sitting room." Claire seemed to loosen up slightly with the news. "I'm healing well and fairly quickly. Which is good, the slashes on my back and stomach were really painful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fighting naked runs that risk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was not fighting naked. How did that get started?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lauren. You should have seen Erick drool though." Claire laughed. "I thought he was going to lose it right there. Until he heard about your medic. Then he almost choked on his chips. It sounded like you got messed up pretty badly though. You sure you should be here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm ok. I can't really stay still anyway, so might as well do something while I'm restless. Speaking of, could you help me find another set of drawings? For an EMD SD70M."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, all the newer stuff is over in this corner." Claire led the way to the back left section of the room and pulled open a drawer. "In here. The other newer ones are in the rest of these drawers. So, you going to the Cathouse tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Planning to, yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cool."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know of any dance wear shops in town?" Kali grinned and added, "Fighting naked gets mighty chilly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire laughed in return. "There's one not far from the gothic shop we were in the other day. It's where I got my workout gear for dance classes. They have a wide selection."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks, catch you later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Drawings in hand, Kali headed out into the yard. She started to settle onto the floor to slip in to look at the circuitry. Pressure on her back and sides sent shards of pain radiating from her wounds. She stood back up. Sitting in the control chair wasn't quite as bad as long as she didn't lean back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A quick check of the systems indicated she would have to pull components out. She stood slowly and walked back into the shed. She found Bart in his office. "I'm going to have to wait on the locomotive. I'm a bit too sore to get at all the places I need to check. Sorry about that. If you need it quickly, someone else will need to take a look at it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It can wait. You don't need to apologize for getting injured on an extraction. You know you don't have to be here after yesterday. Will you need a bay when you are able to work on it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I don't think so. And I know I don't have to be here. I just can't stay still and I was hoping I could do something useful with the excess energy. Guess I can't though." Kali paced around his office. A drawing of a boiler section caught her eye. "Although... Do we have any scrap sheet metal? Say eighth inch thick?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure we do. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If I bent it right I could use it to protect my arms and shins the next time out. Who's the best at metal work?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tim, but if you really want precision work, there are a couple of absolute geniuses at Eternal Metal Works. Their shop is in Goth City, just up the line toward Portal Station. Ron Oestrander is the boss man. Or you and Tim can try and bend it up here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything going up there later? Maybe I'll do that today instead."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Check at Central Station, but there's almost always traffic between here and there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks boss." Kali spent the rest of the morning reviewing the servo systems for the locomotive. She could manage to concentrate as long as she sat forward on a chair, well away from the backrest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She left a few minutes before noon and arrived at Central Station a few minutes later. A platform agent directed her across platform ten and into a section of large storage areas that had been divided up with temporary walls. Following the largest of the narrow hallways she emerged into an office. Lauren sat behind the only desk going over maps and diagrams. As Kali approached she could see they were the ones from the last mission. "Oh hi Kali. Anastasia is expecting you. I'm just trying to record what happened yesterday for the Hall of Records. They've been trying to keep a history of Eternia going. Through the door to your left, down the hall to the second door on the right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked at her hands and kind of waved them a little. "That would be this way," she motioned with her left hand, "and then this way?" she motioned with her right hand. "Sorry, I'm right-left dyslexic."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali followed the instructions to another office down the hall. This one was smaller and more crowded than the last. A tiny desk, two chairs, and a book case were wedged into the small room. Scattered everywhere were stacks of plans, maps, and pencil sketches of various places and buildings. Here and there clothing designs in pencil, water colors, and inks were layered over the top. Two torchier lamps struggled to push back the gloom of the enclosed space.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia squeezed around the end of the desk, grabbed the piles off the guest chair, motioned to Kali to sit,  then perched on the edge of her desk. One of the images that flew by looked like one of the tops she had bought when shopping with Claire. "I've seen that before..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I design for the goth shop on Elm Hill."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked! I found some way cool things there the other day."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad. I enjoy designing. So, here we are. I have this prepared thing I tell the new comers, but it covers what you already saw. I could tell you to follow instruction better, but that seems like a bad idea after yesterday. I do want to say thank you for sticking to your convictions. I recommend you stay clear of Alisha for a while though. It will take her a while to forgive you, especially since you were right. Do you have any questions now that you've had some time to think over what happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not that come to mind. I can't promise I wont go off on my own again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, because I don't want that promise. Although your fighting style seems rather risky. The entire dive into the thick of them and lay about works as long as they don't have ranged weapons."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is a rather good point. Although, if you close fast enough the others in their ranks provide cover."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"True enough. What happens if they bring magic into it? We have started to as you likely noticed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then I'm screwed? Most likely we will field a mix like they will. Lauren seemed to be holding her own quite well. Ennui is another very powerful battle mage. Maybe we could draw on her too?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, when we need another person." Anastasia rose. "Now, let's get you settled in." She led the way farther down the hall to a door on the left. She flipped on a switch and harsh florescent light burst from a wall mounted fixture to light up the cubby of a room. Inside was a tiny desk, chair, and shelf. The walls were of bare plywood and the ceiling was open to the dark vault of the station ceiling high overhead. "All of us get one of these offices, but mostly they get used as a dumping place to keep things in easy grabbing range. You can use it or not at your pleasure. If you want to fancy it up, that's fine too. Your assigned compartment on the train is the same way. In mine I try and keep a spare set of clothes and maybe a weapon or two. Other than that, there is a cache of useful items in the storage area of the common car that everyone can use."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, I forgot to grab your clothes this morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's ok. Bring them next time you come down." Anastasia guided Kali back through the maze of small rooms, pointing out various ones and listing off whose it was. "You already know most of the train layout. There is a baggage and equipment car at the rear of the train. That's where the weapons and equipment gets stored. Otherwise, it's mostly what you saw yesterday."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked, I think I've got it. I have an unrelated question though. I would like to get to Goth City. Whom do I see in the station for scheduling?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could ask anyone on the platforms, or talk to Fred. I think she's usually at the information counter. She has a monitor showing her what Central Dispatch is seeing for local traffic. Are you doing ok? You took a lot of punishment yesterday."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Surprisingly well actually. Danny checked me out..." she stopped and blushed before amending, "Danny looked over the injuries and they are healing very rapidly and well. As for the bruises and the like, not nearly as painful as I feared."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ahh... So anything you'd like to tell me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Gods, what is it with everyone? I'm not interested in Danny that way. I know I could be and it wouldn't be a problem. I'm not ready to go there yet, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, ok," Anastasia replied, laughing. "Just one of the common adaptation reactions is the screaming hornies. And one of the most common reactions to a fight like yesterday's is also the screaming hornies."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well, ok.." Kali replied through her bright red face. "I'll be seeing you later." She mumbled as she slipped away. She ran for the nearest women's restroom. Inside she rushed into a stall, snapped the door closed and sank onto the stool. She shook as the emotions of rage, despair, and terror stormed through her. Her skin crawled at the thought of someone touching her. She bit her tongue until it bled to keep from moaning out loud in pain and fear. Tears leaked through her fingers and dropped on her lap as her heart pounded painfully in her chest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Long minutes passed as she shivered in the small cubicle. Slowly the tears stopped and dried on her face. When the shakes had stopped she pulled her head up out of her hands. Her eyes stared out with a glassy distant stare at her surroundings. She waited until she didn't hear any movement in the room before easing the stall door open. Using paper towels wetted in cold water she cooled her face until the worst of the red puffiness had receded. She stalked from the room with her face set in a neutral mask. Moving swiftly she made her way back to her flat where she collapsed on her bed as a second round of shakes hit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She slid down into troubled sleep where she ran through dark alleys and narrow caverns, always with hands pulling and grabbing at her. A pushed up section of bricks tripper her, sending her scrambling forward on her hands and knees until dark shapes tackled her and pinned her down. Claws tore and pried at her until her screams yanked her out of sleep. She twisted about in blankets pulled too tight, toppled off the bed, and hit the floor. Twisting and screaming she finally thrashed loose of the blankets. Her breath came in shuddering gasps as she huddled with her back against the bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rather than fading, the terror built energy continued to increase, driving her to her feet. She ran downstairs to her studio, threw CDs into the player and turned it up full. The tinny and thin sound did nothing to help. After a few minutes she snapped it off and hurried back up to her room. She stripped off her boots and the boiler suit, reached into the closet, grabbed the nearest items and pulled them on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her bare feet slipped silently down the stairs and out into the night. It wasn't until she stepped onto the cold cobbles that she realized she was barefoot. Shrugging it off, she continued to the Cathouse. She danced off the stairs and into motion. The flashes of thong and thigh, through the slits in her skirt, drew many looks until the watchers saw her face. Then they quickly found other places to look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When her timing started to slip, as she approached exhaustion, she slipped around behind the bar and ran for the loading platform out back. There she continued to move until she fell. Immediately she sprang back up and continued. Soon she was falling and dragging herself back up. Her fingers tore and bled on the rough brick of the building. Splinters from the wooden decking left tears in her palms. In the far distance the pain almost registered, but it wasn't enough to stop her. Finally she fell and couldn't get back up. Her hands continued to twitch and jerk, trying to force herself up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali floated in a disconnected haze for an unknown time until Ennui's voice started to pull her back. "Kali? Kali, can you hear me? Delirium, run and get Dementia!" A faint warmth registered on her skin where Ennui touched her shoulder.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is it? Gods, what happened?" Dementia slid to a halt near Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I came out and found her here. She'd been dancing inside earlier."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's get her up to our rooms." Gently Ennui and Dementia pulled Kali upright. The half carried half walked her up the stairs and settled her on their bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She came in dressed like that? Where are her shoes?" Dementia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. She came in barefoot."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was there any trouble?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. A couple of the usual rowdies were eying her up, but no one did anything to her while she was dancing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not for them," Kali said in a flat, distant, and emotionless voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's not for them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not their choice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What choice is that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I choose who touches me. No one else has that right." Kali's voice was a little stronger, although it still came from a great distance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course it's your choice! What gave you any different idea?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Must keep moving. Help me up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, you're exhausted. You need to sleep, let your body heal." Dementia reached out and gently touched her shoulder. Shattering images poured into her head. Ruined cities, a bloody, burnt, and screaming child huddled in rubble, dark shapes gliding in the shadows. Her head slammed back into the wall with a crack and her mouth pulled open in a silent scream. Loss, pain, and despair washed over her in waves, followed by a raging stream of chaotic energy, demanding movement. It crawled along her nerves burning itching traceries across her skin. Instinctively Ennui reached for her, stopping when Dementia threw her head back and forth wildly. "Knock down tea, full strength, for Kali, please." Her eyes glazed over as the terrors chasing Kali became hers as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the kitchen Ennui's hands shook as she struggled to prepare the tea. Once the herbs had steeped she dropped ice into it to cool it and, moving as rapidly as she dared, she carried a full cup back to the bed. "Kali, this will help. Please drink it." Kali didn't respond. "Kali," Ennui reached out and touched her hair. Slowly Kali's eyes focused on her. The images released Dementia, slipping away in a receding tide. "Kali, you need to drink this. It will help. I'm going to help you up." Ennui slipped her arm under Kali and helped her to sit up. Dementia placed a shaky hand in the middle of her back to help keep her upright while Ennui held the cup.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It will relax you, stop the images for a while," Dementia whispered softly. Kali's empty eyes swung to her. "It happens to me too. This will help you rest without dreams and visions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The tea slid down her throat easily with none of the bitter, nasty flavor of the realms medicines. With it came a heavy black warmth. As she faded into darkness she heard a voice in the distance, "Rest now daughter."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui eased Kali back down and met Dementia's haunted eyes over her. "What happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia eased down and wrapped Kali in a tight embrace. "I touched her and everything in her mind crashed into me. I fear for her, Ennui. She is so very troubled. Slide in on the other side of her. She shouldn't be alone." Ennui grabbed a spare blanket from the closet, placed it over the two on the bed, then slid in on the other side of Kali. Dementia reached over and pulled Ennui close to Kali, then reached across to touch her.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali woke with the early morning light. Warmth pressed in from two sides. For a moment claustrophobia threatened, then she opened her eyes to see Ennui and Dementia snuggled up against her. A desperate need to pee forced her to move. Two sets of sleepy eyes opened as she tried to slip away. She smiled and slid toward the end of the bed. "Got to pee. I'll be right back." When she returned she started to sit down on the end of the bed until Dementia grabbed her and hauled her back into the middle of them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How are you feeling?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just ok?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, actually much better than ok. Thank you both. I'm sorry for being such a pain in the ass."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stop, right there. You were not a pain. Don't go adding this to the firestorms in your head." Dementia said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What? What did you see?" Kali paled suddenly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The wreckage, the screaming girl, and the ash. Don't add this to it. There is no shame in needing help." Dementia replied</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything else? Did you see anything else?" panic tinged the edges of Kali's voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia pulled Kali down and gently turned her head until she could look in her haunted eyes. "You don't need to fear me. I will not hurt you. That is all I saw."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should go," Kali struggled to sit up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia held her back, "No, you should stay here with friends."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are things in my past..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You need not tell anything of your time before Eternia. If you wish to, you may, but none expect it. Here you are known by who you are and what you do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I feel like I've lost so much, and I don't even know when it happened. One day I looked inside and all I saw was the barren waste. What was I? What happened to me? What was I supposed to be?" Kali drew a shuddering breath and continued, "Most of my life I've felt weird and out of place, and while things here feel so much better, I can't seem to shake the baggage. I survived by staying distant, building masks and shells, and letting no one underneath. Strangers you can shield yourself against. But friends, family, and lovers, they slide in under the radar and carpet bomb your psyche. And now I'm here and the masks are slipping and the old terrors are clawing free. Goddess, I just don't know what to do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, it's ok," Dementia said softly, stroking her hair.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How, how is it ok? I want to explore what this means but all the old shit boils up," She pushed herself toward the edge of the bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not this time. You might hate us when this is over, but you are staying and talking about this." Dementia grabbed her in a tight hug.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you dance?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you dance?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I told you, because I can't stop."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you dance if you didn't have to?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And why not?" Kali stared at Ennui. "Why not?" Ennui asked again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't want to." Kali dropped her eyes away from Ennui.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why not?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Leave it alone!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Why wouldn't you dance if you didn't have to?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alright! Because I'm ugly and clumsy and move like I have a board up my ass..." Kali yelled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is wrong with you?! Have you looked in a mirror lately? Have you heard what anyone says about your dancing? Are you deaf or just fucking stupid?" Kali's head shot up, eyes cold and hard.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui..." Dementia started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, she's being stupid and she needs to hear this. I don't know who filled her head with crap, but it is not true. Do you hear me, Kali? It Is Not True. I don't know who wanted to destroy you, but do you want them to succeed?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why not? Why not let them succeed? Stupid, selfish, prideful, why shouldn't something like me just end?" Kali snarled back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Goddess, is that how you see yourself?" Dementia held her tighter. "That isn't you!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't know anything about me," Kali spat. "I am all those things and more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bullshit!" Ennui shouted back. She shoved her face right up to Kali's and snarled, "You know less about yourself than your friends. We see you every day. What you do, how, and when. Don't you dare wallow in self despair around me. You want an ass-kicking, fine! Mama y Mama, any time, any where. I'll make you understand if it's the last thing I do!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fuck you! Right here, right now." Kali hissed back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui, Kali..." Dementia started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two sets of burning eyes swung to regard her and two voices screamed, "What!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fine, just fine," she muttered, backing away slowly. They sprang from the bed and circled each other like two stalking cats. Just before they pounced Dementia leapt between them. "Gods damn it all! Stop acting like men."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">""Men?" two voices screeched.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, men, beating your chests and getting ready to pound on each other. Stop this before you both get hurt. Kali, you don't have the truth of yourself. No one does, not without all sorts of mystic mumbo jumbo, and even that rarely works." She slowly walked toward Kali, hands open and spread. Kali stood still, shaking and panting, but some of the rage had bled out of her eyes. Gently Dementia cupped her face, "You deserve so much more than you believe. If you can't think well of yourself, let us do it for you and listen to what your friends say. It is more objective than what you cook up inside your head. Religions have it wrong when they say what's in your heart is most important. What you do in the world defines you and matters the most. You have done many good things and you need to accept that it makes you good as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali backed away, her head shaking from side to side violently. "No, no, can't be good. Don't want to be good. Good means responsibility, expectations, being judged, playing by someone else's rules. Fuck that!" She continued backing away until she hit the wall. There she stayed, hands raised claw-like in front of her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, it's not that way here. You belong. No one will take that from you. No one will judge you unworthy of it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I just want to belong. Why can't I ever feel like I belong?" Kali wailed as she slid down the wall, curled in on herself, and shuddered with long wracking sobs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui slid down beside Kali and wrapped her arms around her. "You belong here in Eternia." Dementia sat down on the other side of Kali and added her arms to the tangle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I just feel so empty and scared. I had dreams once. Insane, crazy dreams, impossible dreams, but they kept me alive and...operational...through my teens and early adulthood. One day I "woke up" and realized they could never happen. Ever since then I've just been empty, staggering through life because I was either too stubborn or too scared to die. I don't even know which, probably scared, that seems to be me, scared of everything and everyone. Once I leave here I'll freak because you know too much about me now. You've seen it, the shattered wastes," Kali stared at Dementia through distant eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let this place give you a dream back. This would be 'impossible' from a Realms perspective, wouldn't it," Dementia replied. "Try not to fear your friends. Why would we want to destroy you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why would my parents want to? Yet they were always telling me I was nothing special, that anyone could do what I do, that my ego was too large."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who knows, but they aren't here. You are free of them. And your ego isn't large enough from what I've seen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need to go. Bart'll be waiting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not today. Today you stay here with your friends and we show you we aren't going to hurt you. Ennui will have someone tell Bart the last rescue caught up with you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a few more minutes Kali was able to sit there, then her hands started to rub at her arms and head. Soon she pushed herself up and began to pace jerkily around the room. "It begins again," she moaned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can use the dance floor if you want. Turn on the amps on the lighting platform, shove some CDs into the changer and bring up the first fader on the sound board. That should get music for you. Are you going to want food?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks. Maybe food later, but not now." She practically ran from the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Go with her, see if you can stop her before she collapses again. I'll bring you some food and coffee soon," Dementia told Ennui. Kali was already in motion when Ennui arrived. She stood quietly in the shadows observing. Slowly a devious plan formed in her mind. She was grinning to herself when Dementia slipped in behind her and wrapped her arms around her. "Hey love, your coffee and food are on the bar. How's she doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui turned so she could speak into Dementia's ear over the pounding music, "Showing no signs of slowing down. I have something I'd like to try later." Dementia quirked her eyebrows. "If you could get her out of here just before band practice today, then arrange to bring her back when we are practicing. I want to see how she reacts to our stuff."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's not all, is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, but I want to see what happens before I say any more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, I'll try."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several hours later Kali slowed to a stop and approached Dementia on shaky legs. By the time she reached the bar a large glass of water was waiting. Kali smiled and asked, "Might I raid the kitchen for food?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could, or we could go grab some elsewhere."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I did want to go back to the goth shop and the dance wear shop on Elm Hill anyway. Is Ennui going to join us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She has a few things she needs to do here." Dementia replied as she led the way out of the club. The sky was dark and heavy with a damp grey fog woven between the buildings. "How are you doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want me to say? Everything has changed and I still don't know how to cope? My head is still full of shit and I don't know if it will ever get better? Why should I burden those around me with my trivial issues? I've already been hijacking your time, Ennui's time, and Bart's time. At this rate I'll be stopping people in the streets next."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui's right, you need to see yourself for what you really are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then tell me something you like about yourself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tell me something you like about yourself. It's a simple enough request."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali walked in silence for many steps before answering, "I'm not fat anymore."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And what else do you like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is ridiculous!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it's not. You see your flaws in sharp, over-examined detail, but you don't have a clue about your good points. While you are thrashing around in your head you might consider that you dance better than most professionals and you don't have the ego problems they do. You are brave and strong enough to fight for your friends and you have the courage to talk to people about yourself, something many can't do at all. You care about the people around you, even though you don't want to believe it." She grabbed Kali's arm as Kali turned. "Not this time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you think you can really stop me?" Kali asked in an icy tone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Only if part of you wants to stop running." Dementia said, staring straight back into Kali's stormy eyes. "What happened to you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know! I don't remember being raped, beaten mercilessly, or seriously messed with like some of my friends. Yet my first reaction to any contact is threat assessment, fear, and distancing. The closer someone gets the more I fear them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And why is that wrong? Things can be dangerous."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to understand how some people can smile at strangers, can say hello without their insides twisting. How can they be friendly knowing how anybody can be a hostile?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They believe the world isn't always hostile. It's not always easy, but it can be done. You could do it too if you really want to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali slowed as they entered Elm Hill. "Look, could we grab coffee and find a quiet place for a few minutes before I go shopping?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, but I thought you were hungry too?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was, but I'm not any more. Maybe later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia led the way to the coffee shop she liked near the Goth Shop. The trees and plants looked slightly wilted under the weight of the fog. The outside tables were empty but sounds of conversations and the hiss of an espresso machine came from within. Dementia led the way to the counter and ordered. Kali started to but changed her mind when nerves tightened her stomach. She idly scanned the room while Dementia waited, noticing the small brick enclosed patio out the back of the shop. Kali headed that way once Dementia had her order. Kali settled into a chair behind the farthest table with the best view of the door. Water dripped slowly from the ivy and trees overhead and onto her head and shoulders, drawing a small twitch from her, but not enough for her to move. Once Dementia was settled in facing her she began, "I was going to tell you about before..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't have to..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I do. It is why I am so...clueless, i guess, about so much," Kali stopped as fear clenched her heart. "I wasn't...I wasn't...." she stopped as black spots danced in front of her eyes and dizziness almost spun her from the chair. For long moments she struggled to control the panic and catch a breath.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, it's ok, you don't have to say..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was born male, I didn't want to be, and I hated every part of it, but that's how everyone tried to raise me," Kali stopped again as her nerve failed once more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, that's more change than most of us, no wonder your head's a mess!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Instant change with no understanding of what to do with the changes. Everything is so different and not and...and..." The shakes hit her hard, almost flinging her from the chair. She dropped her head into her hands and tried to ride it out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia leaned over and pulled Kali tight to her, stroking her hair softly, "Hey, easy, easy, it's ok. I mean it's a shock, but it's ok. I was afraid you were going to say you were a child molester or something. I would never have guessed, you seem just like every other woman I've ever known, maybe a bit stronger and more self-possessed, but that's it. So, do you want to talk about it? I'd like to listen if you do..." Kali remained silent and shaking in her arms. "Hey, hey, it's ok. Now you can be who you want to be." Slowly Kali wrapped her arms around Dementia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't want this to be an 'oh, poor pitiful me' session. I fucking hate talking about this. My past is nobody's business but I need someone to understand, someone I can ask for help. Fuck, fuck, fuck!" Tears leaked from her eyes and dripped onto Dementia's shoulder. "I don't want to be a freak, but I'm still a freak, even here, even now, just a goddamned freak." She clung to Dementia as shudders wracked her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Look, I've got a clue for you, everyone is a freak. Normal's just a way to enforce control. I'm a freak, I get 'visions from the devil', at least that's what I was told. Ennui was a circus girl. To the rest of her world she was an outsider, a freak, if you will."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry." Kali said after a while as she started to pull away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. How many times do I have to tell you? You don't have to run from me." Dementia said as she tightened her grip. "This isn't a pitiful Kali session. You want me to understand you, that is always a good thing. We can stay here or go, but I am serious, you shouldn't be alone today." Dementia slowly released Kali as she settled down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stay, I guess." Kali stared into space for a very long time. "I don't know how to talk about it. It consumes your every thought, how wrong you feel in any gender charged situation, how uncomfortable in your own skin, how freaky you must be. Watching the kids around you change the way you want to and seeing yourself change some other way. Now that's all over, but I'm still the freak in my head, pounded by the fucked up gender roles everyone tried to teach me as I was growing up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When we'd play house as little kids I never wanted to be the mommy or the daddy. By my second year in school I knew I never wanted children. It seemed the ultimate cruelty to bring one into the world and subject them to the others. I hated having to be either the subservient 'wife' or the macho, overbearing 'husband'. I wanted to be the mad scientist in the empty castle on the hill, the shadow walker, or the starship captain alone in the void. I wanted to run screaming from normal life, step out of the bullshit. And yet I tried to settle down but it didn't really work. Then I met others with my condition and saw how badly it can fuck you up. Somehow I got off easy. I wasn't completely insane. I could function and make some friends and get by in the world. But I still never wanted to be there. This, Death City, is a fantasy, but how do I adapt? I still have all the old responses, distrust, a desire to remain distant, to keep the hurts away...And now I'm fucking rambling about shit that shouldn't even concern me any more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No one automatically adapts to sudden change. You are what you want, but you need to give yourself time to catch up. You should ask Bart about sudden changes. He would be happy to tell you about his. It's not the same as yours, but it left him confused and uncertain for a long time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I'd have to tell him about this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You wouldn't. It's accepted fact that everyone here has likely had at least one massive change to adapt to. It's one of the reasons for adaptation reaction in general."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And about confusion..." Kali slowed to a stop, face flaming. Dementia waited, afraid any words would stop Kali from continuing. "I, uh, I have never had a....period," the last word was spoken so softly Dementia almost didn't catch it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's different for everyone, it's a bit of a mess, passing the blood and all, but not a really big deal. Keep some napkins or something on hand and you will be fine. If you had girlfriends, you probably know more about this than you think already."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Will it hurt?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Only if you get cramps. Otherwise, not really. I've known a few people who say they could feel the blood moving, but I'm not one of them. Mostly, it's just another thing in life to get used to." Kali looked down at the ground. "Was there something else you wanted to ask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When I came here, I was only interested in women. Now I'm finding some boys cute too..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You've changed. Wouldn't it make sense that who you are attracted to might also change? You're not very comfortable with your sexuality, are you?" Kali continued to stare at the ground and shook her head. "Because of the other thing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe somewhat, but it's always been weird for me for other reasons as well. Casual sex seemed too risky, both from emotional issues and disease or pregnancy. Sex with a close partner always felt difficult, sort of forced and kind of like I wasn't respecting them. I came from a home life that was way too religious and lacking in any sort of close emotional contact. By my family's definitions, just about everything in life was wrong or sinful. When I hit puberty they handed me a book and said it would answer my questions. To their credit, it did, but it was very impersonal and distant. I think my parents would have been happier if my sister and I had been robots, only active when ordered to do something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds pretty bad, but you did survive it. That says a lot. I'm not totally comfortable with sex either. About the only person I know who is would be Ennui. She loves everything about it and has helped me loosen up a lot. I'd suggest you talk to her if you want some ideas on how to cope." Kali shrugged nervously and Dementia dropped what she had been about to say.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The silence stretched out for long minutes. Finally Dementia asked, "Would you mind if I asked you something?" When Kali nodded ok she continued, "If it wasn't about the gender roles, why did you feel the need to change?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was never about the fucked up social roles, or even about clothes, like it seems to be for so many of my kind. It was about basic body image. I hated the boy bits and the boy chemistry, the grindy testosterone driven rage and despair, and the ugly chunk of meat between my legs. One of my earliest memories is of looking down and seeing that meat hanging there and wishing it would go away. I felt ugly and then my parents gave me the boy hair cut of the time, hair shaved to half and inch or less all over my head, which intensified the ugliness. I hated the social roles I saw growing up and never wanted either of them. People should be able to wear what they want, do what they want, be who they want without some artificial social construct telling them it's wrong. I spent my first adolescence in Alaska. There were plenty of examples of strong women for role models so I never felt the need to be anything other than who I was." Kali stared into the distance and tried to bring her breathing back under control. "Why does it have to be such a loaded thing, to just be? It matters who you sleep with, it matters what's in your crotch. Why is it always such a big deal to people? Don't they have enough of their own shit to keep them occupied?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's always easier to worry about someone else. Takes the attention away from themselves. Lets them feel better about what they are. It does suck though," Dementia replied. "In a perfect world, what would you want?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"To know what it's like to grow up coherent, mind and body in agreement. To have experienced normal puberty and dating and all the rest."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Think about the coherent people you've known, how are they? Are they any less confused, hurt, messed up, than you? Maybe it would have been better in some ways, but I don't think it would have been as different as you want to believe. Your path gave you strength and courage and an understanding that few ever reach. Would you truly want to give that up?" She took in Kali's non-believing stare. "Whatever things were like where you came from you can put it behind you here. No one will ever know anything that you don't tell them. That's the rule from the Lady, even if your closest friend from the Realms arrived tomorrow, they wouldn't be able to spill anything but their own past. It's weird and crazy but it works. You can reveal this about yourself or let it slide away as you choose. Still, it is part of what has made you who you are. Without it you might not have come here and that would have been tragic for those you have helped and a diminishing of those of us who are your friends. Try to think about that when next you spiral into that head of yours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bart accuses me of thinking too much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And he would be right about that. Life suffers from too much analysis. Dance instead. You obviously love it and the rest of us appreciate the beauty."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not that easy..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it's not. You can let your scars and demons consume you or you can own them and live anyway. Those are the only choices. Nothing magically removes them, not even this place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So comforting..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You want me to lie to you too? I think too many have done that in your past already."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, you're right. I just want a reboot, I want to edit the crap out of my head, from twisted religion, to self loathing, to the belief I am worthless. I just want it to stop!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, you, me, Ennui, everyone I know... We all wish it were that easy. Since it isn't we support each other as best we can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, silly. You should know that by now. You doing better?" She watched Kali nod. "You might consider telling Ennui as well. It would make it easier when you want to ask for help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I guess," Kali replied reluctantly. "I just don't want to end up defined as Kali the trans person. I hated that in the Realms."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wouldn't worry about that. You are already defined as Kali the Dancer and Kali the Warrior Woman. Although this explains what was confusing Claire so much the other day. She says you went shopping and freaked out on her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I always freak out shopping. Too many choices and my brain freezes. It can be shopping for clothes, food, even deciding where to go out to eat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That wasn't what freaked her, it was the never dressing to impress. I guess this explains that too, doesn't it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you've never liked the way you look, the thought of calling attention to yourself is really creepy, if it occurs to you at all. Dressing up and, by extension, dressing to impress, always felt like more of a reinforcement of the social rules rather than something to do for fun. Plus, relationships are complicated enough when there aren't odd body parts getting in the way. I dreaded being hit on, finding I liked it, and then having to figure out how to explain. Better to avoid the dangers of that situation entirely. I'm not sure how I feel about it here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You won't have to worry about it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why not?" Kali asked. "Please tell me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't mean this to be hurtful. You are very aware of when people are watching you and you respond with a look that is distant, empty, and a bit predatory. It certainly wouldn't encourage anyone with even a bit of perception. Only the totally clueless would go any further."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali rose, "I need to get going. Soon I'll have to dance again and I really need to get a few things before then."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wish you wouldn't look at it as have to dance again. You make it sound so bad."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alright, I will be dancing again soon, that better?" Kali answered as she headed for the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, and I want you to think that way every time the need hits. Adaptation reaction won't last forever and I selfishly don't want you to stop dancing when it ends."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fine," Kali replied as she opened the door to the Goth Shop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bare foot today? Didn't like the boots?" The woman behind the counter called.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, the boots are wicked awesome, it's just my feet need to go bare foot often or they eat themselves. I need a few more items, so, I'm back again!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali crossed to the rack of camouflage cargo pants. She reached for her old size, then reconsidered and grabbed several to try. Once she found the right new size she grabbed several pairs, stopped and grabbed a variety of thongs, waved at the woman behind the counter, and headed for the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You actually like thongs?" Dementia asked when they were outside.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, they don't crawl, bunch up, or chafe when I'm dancing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Okayyyy. You don't mind the permanent wedgie feeling of them?" Dementia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not really," Kali answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali pulled open the door to the dance shop Claire had mentioned. It was a small shop with a display of toe-shoes, a sampling of basic dance wear displayed on the walls, and several small tables and bins holding sealed packages. She crossed to the leotards and started looking. After a few moments she turned away and walked to the counter. "Uhm, I've just gone through the Eternia form change and I'm not sure what size I am anymore. Can I open a couple packages and try those on?" Kali pointed back toward the leotards.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can, or I can take a few quick measurements for you. That way you'll know for other clothes as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, ok, that would be nice..." Kali blushed deeper as the woman ran a tape around her in various different directions, scribbling numbers on a pad after each time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There, looks like medium if you like them a little tight or large if you like them just a bit loose. Go try a couple on if you want."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali grabbed a couple and headed for the dressing rooms. A few minutes later she emerged, wearing camo pants and one of the leotards. She grabbed a couple more and started to leave.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, you want your measurements?" The woman called from the desk. Kali returned and took the offered paper. "You look familiar, do you hang out at the Devil's Cathouse?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sometimes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was that you dancing last night? That was so cool! Do you take students?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lots of pros take on a few students for cash, at least they did in the Realm I'm from. I would like you to teach me if you're taking students."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Students? Teach? I didn't even know how to dance before I came here. I wouldn't know how to teach, I'm sorry."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I thought...It's ok, just if you ever do, please let me know. I'd love to have you teach me your style."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, ok, right, um thanks for the measurements, and all..." Kali hurried out the door before spinning to Dementia. "That was really weird."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No one ever ask you to show them anything before?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not a total stranger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I tried to tell you how good you are. Does that help convince you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess so."</p>
<br/>
<p class="pagecaption">At the Devil's Cathouse</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Throbbing dark rhythms met them as they walked back into the Cathouse. Kali dashed down the stairs, threw her bags toward the bar, and launched into motion. She didn't notice the lights were up, only the music mattered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On stage Ennui smiled broadly and motioned to the rest of the band. Instantly the music stopped. "That seems good. Maybe we should go over the opening once more. Claire, you ready on lights?" When the stage lights bumped quickly the lead guitarist set her instrument in a stand and climbed on the gurney at the back of the stage. Ennui, and two others walked back to it and pushed it to the center of the stage. Ennui crossed to her bass while the others moved to drums and keyboards. The drummer smashed a mallet into a huge gong. The lights flashed once. The drummer slammed the gong again and the lights flashed once again. The drummer began a slow heartbeat rhythm and the keys came in with a low, haunting melody. Kali began mouthing words without even noticing as she danced. The gong crashed again. Suddenly the keys gave forth a shriek and the figure on the bed twitched. Kali raised her arms aloft and screamed, "Life, give my lover life!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The band faltered for a moment and Kali dropped her arms as she realized she had spoken. "Kali, what did you say?" Ennui called from the stage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No.. nothing...I'm sorry..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really, we'd like to know. It sounded like it would fit the music. Please."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, I really don't remember. I was dancing and then I heard someone shouting, then you called to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Claire, would you get Kali a headset. Kali, would you let Claire record what you say?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd rather not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You won't have to listen to it. It would let us hear what you said." Claire held up a headset microphone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well...ok...but I probably won't even remember what I said before. And remember, you promised, I don't have to listen to it, ever!" Kali reluctantly agreed as she took the offered mic. She slipped it on and waited for the opening to begin again. This time through the band didn't stop when Kali shouted. They kept going to the end of the first number.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui motioned for playback and stood listening to Kali's track. "Wow, listen to this, this is perfect! Claire, send it to the rest of the band, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali jerked rigid as her voice sounded in her ears. She opened her mouth to scream, then closed it as she listened to a low alto voice with dark over tones and a hint of an eastern European accent. Her words were haunting and powerful, telling of a dead lover and a desire to bring her back to life.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, that's great! May we use it? It so fits the idea for the opening. Bella, you could add some more haunting keyboard and we could sing over it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think Kali should sing it. It needs a darker voice." Claire said through the headphones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think Kali should sing it," Kali replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should, and you should dance with the band, at least for the first night back. It would so totally rock the house and be a great way for the band to come back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come back? What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The rescue where we met? We lost one of the band on that mission. When we next play it will be the first time since then." Ennui answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know. Claire, I'm no performer, I don't think I could do it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure you could. With the headset mic you could be anywhere, even in with the rest of the dancers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Although, it would be really cool to have you up on stage with us," Ennui countered. "I remember several bands from the realms that had stage dancers. You certainly have the moves."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no, I think I like Claire's idea better," Kali replied, face burning. "I'm not a performance dancer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bullshit," the drummer countered. "You're as good as the best I've seen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, this is Audrey, Nightshade on stage," Ennui introduced the drummer. "And this is Beth, Belladonna on stage, our keyboardist, and Maggie, Nausea on stage, our lead guitarist and the other vocalist."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should at least give it a try. Rehearse with us a few times and see how it feels. I think you'd be great!" Maggie added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And people are watching you on the dance floor anyway. Remember the dance shop clerk," Dementia called from the bar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The itching burn of energy began to crawl along Kali's nerves again. "Ok, I'll practice a bit, just let's get started again." Ennui flashed her a questioning look. At Kali's nod she motioned to begin. They ran through the opening several times, each time Kali was a little less tentative with her vocals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After the fourth run-through Kali said, "This seems good, but we could make it a lot more theatrical."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Image this for example. Start with a dark stage with a single spotlight on the back entry. A doctor looking character pushes a table into the center of the stage, followed by the usual hunchback assistant. The doctor begins a pantomime of stitching together a body from various parts. Once in a while asking the assistant for another body or a part. This is where my current vocals go, as well as some nice haunting, creepy keyboards. At the end of it the doctor and assistant attach the table to a lift and haul it up to the roof. There the fake body gets switched with Maggie and we use the lightning and thunder effects. Once the table is lowered Maggie rises and you launch into the second half of the lyrics, something about a dead girl living again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hmm, might work," Maggie commented. "Although we'd have to get mods made to the club."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not a problem," Dementia called from the bar. "The back sections are above here, shouldn't take much to pull more floor and the lift we can get from the sorting center. Probably be done middle of next week. You still planning for next friday as your new debut?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think so. Kali, can you have the rest of the lyrics by early next week?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rest of what lyrics?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"To Dead Girl Living of course. It's your concept, it should be your song."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute, I'm not even a musician."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are now, unless you want out. You should give it a try though. Just think poetry to music, that helps me." Beth replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, right. Could you guys play some more? I really ne...want to dance some more." Kali headed for the stairs down from the stage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where are you going?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Back to the dance floor, unless you are running the opening again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If your going to be the stage dancer you should get used to the stage."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, right, ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several hours later Dementia called, "Club opens in an hour. You might want to pack it up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once the gear was moved off the stage Kali headed to the bar to pick up her clothes. "Kali, you want to stay for dinner? It'll be bar food but I expect you'd be coming back anyway, so this will be easier." Dementia offered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"True. I'll stay, thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali finally staggered home long after midnight. She reached for the doorknob and only vaguely registered the note taped to it. Half way up the stairs it registered enough for her to go back and read it. "Kali, I stopped by to see how you are doing. No one has seen you today and I was wondering. I'm going to wait a while in case you come in late. I'm on the pillows in the living area. If I'm asleep, see you in the morning, I hope. Danny."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali slipped into the living area and looked down. Danny was curled up in the pillows, peaceful in sleep. Kali smiled, grabbed a spare blanket from her room and draped it over him. He stirred in his sleep, pulled it up under his chin, and settled back down. Upstairs Kali fell into bed and slipped into sleep.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali woke cross-wise on the bed with vague memories of tormented sleep. "Still not sleeping?" Danny asked as she stumbled down the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not very well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you doing ok otherwise?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, why do you ask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You weren't around yesterday and Anastasia was fairly certain she'd freaked you out the day before. She said you left looking really strange, either very angry or very hurt, she wasn't sure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't really anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Look, this is all just so new, the fighting, the healing, the magic, trains to different worlds. It catches up to me sometimes, just how much everything changed in the last couple of weeks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"About that healing..." Kali pointed at her legs. "Damn, these look like you've had them a week or more. Guess that answers your question. Is there any pain, swelling, or discoloration on any of the others?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali shook her head. "No. You know another thing I love about this place? I can go to the Cathouse, stay until I'm almost deaf, and my ears are fully healed by morning. And the best thing of all, I can breathe clearly on a daily basis."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean about the breathing? Were you asthmatic before?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I might have been. Most mornings I would end up in at least one major coughing fit. Cold weather, car exhaust, most perfumes and cleaning products would prompt the same reactions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds asthmatic to me. Glad that's gone for you as well. So, you want food? I'm cooking again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't have to cook this time. I didn't think I had any food after the last time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You didn't. I went to the market on my way over last night, and it's no problem, I like to cook. Let me treat you again. That way I can be sure you're eating enough."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm eating fine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You do realize you aren't sleeping well and are dancing and exercising more than most."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't want to start eating too much and get fat like I was in the realms."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you don't get enough food your body will start to eat itself and it will effect your dancing. I'd appreciate it if you kept track of your weight for a while, until you know you are eating enough."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, ok. I am a little bit hungry," Kali sat and watched Danny for a few minutes before finally asking, "Why all this interest in me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I consider you a friend and I take care of my friends." He set a large section of cheese, mushroom, and sausage omelet in front of her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We don't even know each other."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've seen you naked, fixed you up, and helped you home. That should count for something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess," she responded slowly. "But lots of people have seen me almost naked of late."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's true. Doesn't stop me from wanting you for a friend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you say so," Kali launched into her food.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you mind if I asked you something?" Danny asked a few minutes later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If I do, I won't answer," Kali smiled to take the sting from the words.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've always wanted to ask women why they shave their pubes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, let's get personal, but I'll answer it if you answer why do men shave their faces?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny laughed, "Ok, I shave because my beard comes in ragged and itches like a mad fiend. Shaving is just easier."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fair enough. I shave because I like the look. Although," Kali's eyes danced with mischief in her bright red face, "I'm thinking it looks a little plain down there. Maybe I should spice it up with piercings or tattoos."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She openly grinned at Danny's wince. "Ouch! It looks very fine down there, really."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you are a connoisseur? How many have you seen?" She shot back, trying to ignore the surge of interest her body felt at his admiration.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny blushed bright red, "Enough. I am a medical professional after all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And how do I stack up?" Panic flickered across her face as she realized she actually asked what she was thinking. "Oh gods, I didn't just ask that, forget I asked that. Don't answer that!" She leapt up and dashed from the room. Up stairs she threw on a boiler suit and boots. Her face was still bright red as she hurried for the door out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are beautiful," Danny murmured under his breath as he sat back, trying to sort through the strange signals Kali had been sending. "You are one strange woman, Kali," he thought while starting on the dishes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nervous energy kept Kali moving at an almost run to Temple Heath. Once there she spent twenty minutes in the yard trying to dance off enough of it to concentrate on the day ahead. She grabbed the plans for the servo system she had tried to work on previously and headed out to try again. The conversation with Danny kept popping into her thoughts the instant her attention wandered. Over and over she analysed it, but couldn't figure out why she had asked that last question.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After a fruitless hour she stalked into the shop, threw the plans on her bench, and found Bart. "I'm sorry, I won't be able to work on that servo today either." She pushed shaking hands through her hair and tried to find something else to say. Energy boiled off her in waves, making Bart start to shift in sympathetic nervousness. "I'm headed to Goth City. You need anything taken up or brought back?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, thanks for asking. Are you ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah." Her look discouraged any more questions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, see you later then."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She ran for the station, arriving out of breath and almost calm. She hurried through the main section of the station and hunted around through the cavernous building until she found the information kiosk. Seated inside was a librarian looking woman leaning back with a large book propped up on her lap. "Fred?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes?" She looked up from a large book. "Do I know you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Anastasia told me to come find you. I was wanting to know about any train scheduled to the area near Eternal Metal Works. I'm Kali by the way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali? The Kali? I expected you to look larger somehow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, the Kali of extraction team fame. I expected you to be more fearsome or something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali rolled her eyes. "Guilty as charged. Although I don't feel very fearsome."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Riiight. Not the way I've heard it told. Anyway..." Fred looked down and typed a few keys. "I show a small freight leaving in ten minutes from platform 5. If you hurry you can make it." She hit a few more keys. "Give the driver this cab permit and you can ride the jump seat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked, thanks! Uh, which way?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fred pointed down the massive entry hall and to the left. Kali dashed off in the indicated direction. She slid to a brief stop when she saw the sign for platform 5. She arrived beside the locomotive just as the driver was finishing a walk around. "Hi,"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hi. Kali isn't it? I thought you'd be, you know, larger, more muscular, somehow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do you know me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How many curly red haired women have you seen wearing a boiler suit wandering around Death City? I figured it was a good guess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, guess so. Fred gave me this cab permit. I'm trying to get to Eternal Metal Works."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No trouble, come with me. I've got some stuff to drop there as well." He smiled and waved her into the cab. "Take the jump seat over there. I'm Alex." He concentrated for a few minutes getting the train cleared and in motion out of the station. "It's about fifteen minutes to the Goth City switches, then another ten to the metal works. I'm afraid I'm not really the talkative sort. Hope you don't get too bored."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm good. Got a lot on my mind anyway." Kali settled back and tried not to let her mind drift toward Danny and the morning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Guess extractions might do that to a person. You've got a lot more courage than I do. I admire that." Kali's eyes popped open. "I don't think I could go out on one of those. How do you do it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe I'm an excitement junky. I don't know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Seems pretty heroic to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stared at him from eyes gone cold and hard. "Look, I'm no hero. I'm just a screwed up girl trying to figure out who she is. Don't try to make me something I'm not." She turned and stared out the window.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A hero is someone who is in the wrong place at the wrong time and makes the best choices to get people back from it. I didn't mean to upset you. Others see you very differently than you see yourself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, and they'd be wrong."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would they be? I wonder..." Alex watched as she stared stiffly out the window. "Maybe you're the one who's wrong. Or, maybe, in the end, it doesn't matter at all who is right or wrong, just that you were there." The rest of the trip passed in silence as his words seeped into Kali's thoughts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty minutes later they pulled between two towering brick buildings and into a large switch yard sourrounded by more large brick buildings. Dust grimed windows and sagging, closed doors marked many of them. Only three had open doors, lights, and sounds of activity. Alex motioned to the center building. "Come on, I'll introduce you to Ron." He swung down from the cab and started toward the doors. Kali hurried to follow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside sounds of hammering, the hiss of welders, and the smell of hot metal washed over her. Alex turned to the nearest person and asked, "Ron around?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In the office."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alex turned left and started up a steep stairway. It wound around the inside of the building to a set of rooms overlooking the main floor. "Ron, this is Kali."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, welcome. Bart told me to expect you. What can we do for you?" Sparkling devilish green eyes glinted in a roundish, sun burned face. What hair he had left was bone white.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need some sheet steel cut and bent. Bart recommended your team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can do that. Alex, you here with the steel?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yup. If we could get that unloaded I'll be on my way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Terry can get you set. He's back with the milling machines right now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Great Ron. See you around, Kali."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks for everything," Kali added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm going to introduce you to Rainy. She handles model making and fabrication planning. She'll get you what you need." Ron rose and led the way back downstairs. He crossed the main floor and entered a smaller section of benches, wood and clay working tools, and partially finished models of odd mechanical pieces. "Rainy, you back here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey boss," A head of bright red hair poked out of a side room, followed by a black clad woman. "What's up?" She was just a bit shorter than Kali and solid, muscular, with a round face and a warm smile. "Kali, isn't it? I love your tattoo! Did you design it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hi. Did we meet? I'm afraid I don't remember..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A couple of days ago, on Farlirish. I was in that cluster of people you dodged through. What do you need?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was hoping to get forearm and shin guards bent out of some sheet steel. Bart sent me over here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good choice on his part. Anything you needed boss? Otherwise I can get Kali's project done in a couple of hours." Ron shook his head and headed back for the office. "We can do that. What did you have in mind?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was thinking eighth inch sheet metal curved to fit around and held on with some type of velcro straps."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's possible, however, anything solid enough to be effective will be heavy. From what I've heard of how you fight, it might hurt more than help. And it would be something that could get grabbed or hooked with claws. Here, let me show you what you want would weigh." Rainy pulled Kali into one of the back storage areas and over to a bin of smaller pieces of metal. She grabbed one and put it in Kali's hand. "This is about the size you would need."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali lifted it, moved it in the motions she would use, then handed it back. "It seemed like a good idea, but it would be too heavy. Sorry to have bothered you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No bother at all. Would you pass on my thanks to the rest of you team for saving our asses? I didn't get a chance to talk to Anastasia."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. Guess I should find a train back. Where would I find a station?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're not very busy. I can show you, on one condition."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tell me about the real Kali, the legend is already confusing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Legend? What the fuck?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several heads came up at Kali's outburst. Then someone pointed and Kali just heard, "That's her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come on, the sub-train connection is in the office building. We can talk along the way." Rainy practically dragged Kali out of the building. "Look, more and more people are afraid to go out because of the interference by the proxy gods and their minions. At first it was just a minor darkling or two trying a few scare tactics. Now real damage is being done to people and equipment. And with the death of Le Mort, the killings have started as well. You're the first one to stand up and kick ass. Anastasia and her people are good defenders, but it will take more than that to keep us safe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But Sammi and Jemima..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I know they've helped too, but we see you around here. No one knows where they are or what they are doing. They blow in to Eternia, and blow back out again. You are more accessible and visible, thus you become the legend." Kali started pacing back and forth across the hallway, not noticnig the people starting to trickle in. "Kali, unless you want to talk to a lot of people, we really need to go," Rainy said when she noticed the others gathering. Kali stumbled to a halt and fear flickered briefly on her face before she drew herself up. Rainy grabbed her hand and dragged her down a stairwell. "We're in luck, a train is just arriving." They hurried on as soon as the doors opened. Within moments the train was in motion again. "This will take us to city center where there's a station, the busiest one in the city. It shouldn't take long to get a train back to Death City."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe I shouldn't have run..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you want to talk to them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, but maybe I could have stopped this legend crap. Now they have even more to feed on." Kali slumped back in her seat and stared out at the tunnel slipping by.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"People need larger than life figures. It's something to aspire to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aspire to? What a laugh. I'm nothing to aspire to. What does it take to make them realize that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This isn't about your wants, it's about their needs."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And what about my clay feet? What happens to their needs then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't mean to be cold about this, but did anyone ever worry about you when you discovered the clay feet of one of your heroes? The same applies. That is for them to deal with."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It just seems so weird," Kali commented as she returned to staring out the window.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You were one of the invisible people in the Realms, weren't you? Best you can do is try and roll with it and be who you are to the best of your abilities. Let the others deal with their own issues. You'll go crazy otherwise. Now, you never did answer my question on your tattoo."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tattoo? Oh, right, I sort of designed it. I found the black work with the labrys and triangle on a temporary tattoo and had the artist help me add the snow leopard to the top." Kali turned back from the window to answer. "I'm sort of toying with the thought of getting either a piercing or another tattoo. Do you have anyone you'd recommend, or know anyone that could recommend a good artist or studio?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I haven't had any done myself, but most everyone at the Dans Macabre speaks highly of Death's Head Tattoo. It's just upstairs from Dans and in the main floor of where I live. What were you thinking of getting done?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not sure yet. Still considering, but I've wanted more tats and a piercing or two for a while. Dans Macabre?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Our local version of the Devil's Cathouse. It's a goth club in Death City."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've heard of the Cathouse."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should check Dans out some time." The subway slowed to a stop at a brightly lit platform. "Well, this is the tube station for City Central Station. Upstairs they can get you on a train back to Death City." Kali stood and headed for the open doors. At the last minute Rainy joined her, "I can always catch another train back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can find my way back..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know that. I'm just enjoying talking to you and I'm not ready to end that." They walked up the wide flight of stairs and into a cavernous hall. Their footsteps echoed in the allmost empty expanse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would have expected crowds."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The city is huge but there aren't that many of us living in it right now. None of us knows why there is so much empty space, but it is weirdly enjoyable. You have some time to stay? I can show you some of the interesting parts."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, I don't know. Adaptation reaction won't let me stay still for long and it's starting to build up again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could take you to Dans and you could burn off some energy dancing, if that's something you do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, it's something I do." Kali followed Rainy as she headed for the main doors of the building. Outside she turned right down a wide cobbled street. They walked several long blocks between tall buildings, at first Kali expected something like New York but the architecture was weirder, more carvings, odd angles, and strange lines. Rainy turned left, crossed the street and started down another one. Five blocks ahead sunlight filtered in from a large clearing to the left. "Up ahead is the inner city park. It's about a kilometer wide and three kilometers long." A block before she turned right and pointed, "I live behind the cathedral, in that shorter brick building. Dans is in the basement, off an alley that runs from the cathedral back lot to the far street. Death's Head Tattoo is on the main floor of my building, next to a small deli." She walked slowly along an overgrown path past the cathedral, giving Kali plenty of time to take in the massive stone structure. "I have a killer view from my flat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No one maintains the cathedral?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, from the condition of the surroundings I'd guess not really. Religion has always creeped me out, so I haven't tried to go inside. You can, if you want."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe another day."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rainy continued up the path around the back of the cathedral and to a narrow alley behind the centerline. She turned down the alley and walked about half way down it. Muted bass rythms drifted up a narrow stair, descending to a metal door. Red neon painted dancing letters in red flame on the wall above the stairs, spelling out, "Dans Macabre". Rainy opened the door and motioned Kali into the dark interior. Small clusters of people danced to the pounding music. A few more sat at the small tables around the edges or at the bar. "It fills up as night falls." Kali smiled and launched herself onto the floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An hour later she slipped into a chair by Rainy. "Thanks. This helped quite a bit. I should think about heading back soon. Was there anything else you wanted to show me this time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The cathedral view, if you'd like." Kali nodded and Rainy led the way back out of the club. "Stairs or elevators?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stairs, I can use the exercise."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rainy cocked an eyebrow at Kali and returned to the area behind the cathedral. Along the wall of her building she started up a fire escape ladder. She climbed the steps to the last platform before the roof, ten floors up. She walked to the right end of the platform, where it ended in a windowed turret on the corner of the building. She opened the window facing the fire escape and climbed in. "There's inside stairs at the front of the building, near the elevators, but the view back here is so much better." Inside was a large, open room with a drafting table with drawings and notes scattered about and a second table with modeling clay, and tools. The next room held a large brass bed, huge teak wardrobe, small table covered with odd colored makeup, nail polishes, and jewelry, and a deep, plush chair. Next was a spacious bathroom, then the kitchen and eating nook and then a large front sitting room with a deep red velvet couch and several more plush chairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once Kali had seen the flat she gravitated back to the turret and the view of the cathedral. "That is a wicked view! How'd you find this place?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was walking around the cathedral and saw the building, went and hunted for the flat with the best view. Since then a few more have taken up residence. Looks like there's a storm coming in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lots of people have been thinking that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I meant the clouds over the park," Rainy pointed to the dark clouds in the distance, over the scrap of park visible past the cathedral.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, sorry. Just too much talk of the escalating dangers on the missions, I guess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'd hear that more, working in Bart's group."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You go out on many missions?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not too many and probably very few from now on. The last one really scared me. Very different from you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked away and shrugged. "I can't help it, really. I'm drawn to it like a moth to a flame but I don't understand why."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't need to apologize. Everyone's different in what they want."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They stood and watched the clouds moving in and the sunlight on the cathedral for a while, until Kali said, "I really need to start back. I think I can find the station."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could walk back, or there's a subway station just down the block from the font doors of this building. Let me show you." Rainy led the way out through the front door and down the nicer stairway to the main entrance. She pointed out the tattoo shop, elevators, and deli that took up most of the first floor. "You want to talk to the tattoo people today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not yet. I need to think about what I really want first."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outside she turned left, walked to the end of the block, and descended a covered stairway. On the platform she pointed to a display board, "You want the number 7 headed toward city center. The first stop is City Central." She stepped a bit closer, Kali didn't hesitate to pull her into a brief hug. "I'll see you again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Count on it," Kali replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* more transition logic here? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stepped off the train at Central Station and was walking across the main hall when she and Dementia spotted each other. "Kali, just back from somewhere?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The city up the line. What brings you to the station?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was headed to the recovery facilities to look for a lift and props for the Love's Bitch opening scene. You want to come along? You seemed to have a good idea of what it should look like and you could help me figure it out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Storm clouds continued to thicken and gather as the train looped around the city and into the recovery yards. Huge warehouses clustered around a group of sidings. Numerous trains were pulled up with people and machinery swarming nearby, moving crates and palets filled with items from the trains into the waiting buildings. Their train pulled up at a small siding where Dementia hurried off. She threaded her way through the activity and into the largest building. Inside and to the right a two level section of offices poked out from the rest of the building. Dementia led the way into one of the ones on the lower level. She stopped short when she saw only a single desk with a sandy haired man sitting at a terminal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dementia, may I help you?" He asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where is everyone, Terry? Who's recording all the incoming items?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You haven't been here in a while, have you? A new recruit came in about three months back and convinced us to try bar coding everything. Now we scan the items as they come off the trains and enter the data using portable terminals. It has really sped things up for us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about all the people that used to log items?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right now they're out coding all the previous stuff and checking the results of the new system against the old. Some will move to the Hall of Records, some will remain to use the new logging tools, and some will move into sorting and return prep. Everyone is happy with the results so far, we've reduced the hassle factor and improved our ability to match items with destinations."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How would I find an item or two for the Cathouse?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can look it up for you if you know what you want, or you can wander the collections, just like always. What are you needing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A hoist or winch that we can rig to lift a metal platform with a gurney on it, some diamond plate or that metal waffle flooring like is used in outside stairs, and assorted pulleys and cable," Kali answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Best bet would be to take a look in building seven. There's a fair amount of that kind of stuff there. If you can't find what you need, Eternal Metal Works might be able to fabricate something. You know where to find building seven?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I do," Dementia replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here, take this scanning unit and wave it over the codes of any items you want. I'll get them packaged up and to the Cathouse early tomorrow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She led the way across the warehouse and out through a side door. The sky had darkened even more during the few minutes they had been inside. She followed a path around the back of the buildings until she came to one with a large seven stenciled over the door. Inside they prowled through stacks and shelves of industrial equipment and hardware. They found the winch, cable, pulleys, and fittings to rig the platform but not the platform itself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can go talk to someone at Eternal Metals about the platform tomorrow morning. I was just there today about a different project." Kali added as they walked back to the main warehouse. Dementia returned the scanning device and they headed back to the platform to wait for a train to Central Station. It started to rain as Kali left Central Station for her apartment. At first it was just a slight spitting of drops, but it rapidly built to a steady downpour. At first she tried to dodge under any shelter but gave it up after the dampness seeped in anyway. By the time she reached her building she had slowed her pace and was tilting her head back to enjoy the rain streaming over her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once inside she hurried up the stairs to her apartment, slowing to a stop when she saw the flower arrangement sitting by her door. Yellow roses were framed by a selection of hybiscus, tiger lily, and bird of paradise blooms emerging from an ornate earthenware jug. An envelope was tied to one of the jug handles. She grabbed it, carried it up, and set it on the stairs to her bedroom. She shed her wet clothes and jumped into the shower to warm up, then took the flowers with her up to her room. She carefully untied the note and opened it once she had pulled on a floppy shirt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside was a note writen in neat hand writing. "Kali, I'm sorry for feaking you out this morning. That was never my intention. Please accept these as an apology for my rude behavior. And let me know if you want anything to help you sleep. Danny." She smiled as she set the note next to the flowers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She ate in, a simple meal of noodles, veggies and soup base. Then she headed off to the Cathouse to find Dementia. She found her behind the upstairs bar. "I was wondering if you could tell me where to find the knock out stuff you gave me a couple of nights ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's an apothecary next to the Goth Shop. He has it. Just ask for Dementia's Tea and he'll know right what you need. And he'd have those other items you should have as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, yes, thanks," Kali said, her face turning red.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">The thing to really think about is sex doesn't require a relationship and relationships don't always include sex. You have a relationship with us, but we aren't having sex. Dementia and I have a relationship and we are having sex, before we got together I would sometimes have sex just for the fun of it, with the understanding it wouldn't lead to anything more involved. You just need to set your terms ahead of time so no one gets confused.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* first performance at the Cathouse with Kali dancing/singing - update where text doesn't match */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia walked out on the stage after the last set by DJ Death. "I know we had DJ Andros scheduled in for the last part of the night, however I have had a very special request. Our very own Love's Bitch has decided to return to the Devil's stage after a long absence. Please give them a proper Cathouse welcome."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked around in surprise at the hoots and calls from the crowd on the floor. Through the thunderous noise 3 women wheeled a sheet draped gurney onto the stage. Silently the one in a pink wife beater, black leather buckle sided pants and cat face makeup broke off and moved to a drum set. The second one, dressed in a white wedding gown with train, greyish face with suture lines and wild tangled dark blonde hair broke off and strode to a waiting rack of keyboards. Kali gave a start as she realized the third figure, dressed in a blood red crop top, spider web stockings, black velvet short dress, and a tuxedo coat with makeup similar to the keyboardist, was Ennui. Ennui set the wheel locks on the gurney and walked to a waiting bass guitar. A single spot flashed on the bed and dimmed to a soft glow as the drummer slammed a huge brass gong. A second flash of light and crash stabbed the figure on the bed as the drummer picked up a slow heartbeat rythm. The dim light began to pulse softly in time, growing a little brighter with each double drum beat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly the keyboards shreiked out a shuddering groan as the sheet draped figure lurched upright. As the sheet fell away the last figure rolled off the bed and half crawled to a waiting guitar stand. Slowly she stood, grey face and suture lines a fitting addition to the faded, torn, and stained pink dress she wore. She took a deep exagerated breath, and launched into a sizzling riff. The band erupted into the first heavy drum and guitar dance number of the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">this becomes their trademark opening. kali likes them well enough that she will go see them any time she can - the next bit takes place the first time Merris is at the Cathouse and sees Love's Bitch perform.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled in the shadows and watched Merris as she watch the now traditional opening of Love's Bitch. Merris watched enthralled as the light flashed and the heartbeat drum began. She was lost in a daze as the dance beat rose with the Bride. Kali spun into motion, pulling her along as the beat strengthened. Merris stumbled after her, not nearly as fluid but willing to give it her all. She loosened up rapidly and was feeling good about how she was doing until she saw Kali. She wound to a stop and stared like half the others on the floor. Once more Kali was lost in her own world, dancing intricate interpretations of the music she was hearing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris was lost in thought as well of a different kind. She heard violin melodies woven throughout the rifs and themes the band played. By the end of the evening Merris was strangely worked up. She was half pacing near the bar, talking jerkily to Kali about the preformance she had just seen. she wants desperately to add violin to their sound - this is the most pumped up Kali has seen her, granted Kali hasn't seen her that much</p>

<p class="regtxt5">she starts with lab coat, sally stitched face markings, and dr. para - sheds the coat to reveal the patchwork dress from nightmare before christmas with the sides slit high enough that she can dance without restriction - as she becomes more comfortable performing with the band she might strip out of that at some point during the night into even less - something light and easy to dance in that is non-restrictive and terrifying the first time she wears it out <look in goth clothing and Cruxshadows dancers - wishfire tour in particular> - heavy boots with buckles - think River-style from Firefly - when she moves to less she may have to mod the stuff she gets to stay in place when dancing - both to stay where desired and not fall apart under the stresses of the movement - look at Jool costume from Farscape - remove lower level of girdle and go more with a wide belt with gauzy veils front and back - narrow in the front, wider in the back, mid length, potential for tangling will set the final length - remove lower level of leather in halter and make sure it is fitted and lined to not chafe under movement</p>

<p class="regtxt5">opening performance:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">wolf howls behind a dark stage, once the theatre organ is online - the opening of Bach's Tocata and Fugue in D Minor will sound while the lights come up slowly to illuminate the Dr. stiding in, motioning her assistant to follow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">assistant goes to a large switch and turns on hot light over parked gurney - simulate operating room light</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali starts with assembling the new body from pieces as she softly sings her words to Merris haunting violin and maybe a bit of keys from Belladonna - she hoists the lift table up with Ennui acting as EyeGore - in a hunchback costume and weird mask - once the table is raised Nausea climbs on while the gong crashes and lightning flashes start - as Nightshade settles into a heartbeat EyeGore drops the table down with the softly pulsing light - Nausea will twitch her hand on the dance floor side - Belladonna wrings the shriek from her keys as Nausea sits up and rolls off the table - a second shreik as she stands, grabs her guitar, and launches into the first dance number - now it has words and is called Dead Girl Living - as the dance beat builds Kali flings off her lab coat and whirls into dance as Ennui ditches the hunchback costume, strips off the mask, and grabs her bass - the band is off into another night of hard hitting music</p>

<p class="regtxt5">beginnings of the scene:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come EyeGore, we must be quick." the doctor admonished the ugly assitant pushing the gurney in behind her. the doctor glided to a table of instruments and pushed it to the gurney. cartoon medical instruments were used in various combos to work on the body on the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"EyeGore, more bodies!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the assitant waddled out and pushed in a wheelbaro with a body slumped in it. several saw strokes and the doctor held up another piece. as she stitched it onto the figure on the gurney haunting music built in the mix. she began to sing with it, softly at first, of her lover dead and of this last effort to bring her back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the stitching finished she secured four hanging chains to the table. "Raise the platform EyeGore," she commanded. the hunched figure scuttled to a huge wheel and tugged at it. slowly the table top rose to the ceiling high overhead. lightning flashed and the violin fell silent. "Life, "cried the doctor, "Give my lover Life!" she shreiked at the sky. lightning flashed again and again. in the background a heartbeat drum rythm began slowly and haltingly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">once she starts gaining confidence she will write Inner Child - about her inner child and the wreckage that surrounds her - which will open the second set</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fall back behind this line," Kali pointed to an area on the map.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why? The enemy is coming through over here," Alyssa pointed to a different section of the map. "We need to stop them before they get to our people."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something else is coming in through a second gate. They will engage the dark forces. We can stand back and hold the stragglers back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa looked at Anastasia. "Here she goes again!" She watched Anastasia react and continued, "Don't tell me you believe her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Has she been wrong?" Alyssa's eyes went hard as she turned and stalked away. Anastasia was about to turn on Kali until she saw the hurt and pain in the other woman's eyes. Instead, she let out a heavy sigh and began issuing new instructions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali walked out into the night and started for the line she had pointed to on the map. She crossed it and slipped deeper into the wreckage around her, headed toward the second portal, the one of the unknown force.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stalked to the train, tension eating at her. She pasted on the most calm look she could manage as she boarded and hurried to a seat in the back of the passenger coach. Once the train had passed through the Portal she gathered her team of Danny, Lauren, Lissa, Kali and Alisha. She quickly briefed them on their real mission. "Ennui will be joining us on this mission. Before you protest Head Dispatch assigned her specially for this mission and she is known to be a powerful battle mage. I want you to keep her from getting hurt. I'll get her when we arrive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You won't need to worry about Ennui," Kali said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia gathered Ennui once the main team had spread out to begin the recoveries. She outlined the mission to her and specifically instructed her to be careful. Then she headed up the ridge toward the location of the demon forces. As the team reached the top of the ridge Anastasia motioned for them to get down and move forward slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the team reached the drop into the adjacent valley they saw a cluster of buildings on the far side. In the center of the buildings a stone circle had been erected. As they watched grey skinned beings emerged from several of the building and poured a large tub of fluid into the center of the stone circle. More figures emerged and formed a circle around the stones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later a larger being emerged from another building and crossed to the circle. It strode into the center and began an intricate, hypnotic ritual. Anastasia motioned everyone back. She was ignored by the entire team. It wasn't until she turned each person's head away that she was able to break the trance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once everyone was assembled out of sight of the valley Anastasia whispered instructions. "We need to stop them from opening that gate. At least until the rest of the mission is completed. Lauren, Alisha and I have some magic that we can use that should blast the stones and topple them. The rest of you need to keep watch to make certain we aren't disturbed. Ennui, you watch the valley for movement our way. Lissa, take the south section of the ridge. Danny, you take the north, and Kali, you keep watch back toward the main group."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the sentries headed off to their posts Anastasia, Lauren, and Alisha began a soft chant. Ennui could feel the energy ebbing and flowing in sluggish ripples, building, then falling back as they struggled to keep the rhythm. The grey beings ritual built into a frenzy as darkness began to coalesce in the center of the stones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui risked a quick glance back to the three spell casters as they continued their struggle. A small white ball was forming near Alisha. She tried to juggle it in a shaking hand. To Ennui the pattern looked ridiculously simple. Finally, in frustration, she called, "Transfer control. Give me the pattern, you are losing it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You haven't been trained. I can't," Alisha replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Transfer control, NOW. I can stabilize it. Give me the pattern!" A flash of anger flitted across Alisha’s face as she tossed the energy ball toward Ennui. It darted to a place above her head and began to pulse and wobble crazily. Sweat popped out on Ennui's face as she fought to stabilize the badly executed pattern. For a few minutes she tried to maintain it as a destructive blast. In the back of her mind she could feel the dark energies as they built to cataclysmic proportions in the stone circle. The answer blossomed in a perfect moment of clarity and she shifted and turned the pattern in her hands until it became the perfect counter-point to the spell in the valley.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly the blob popped into a perfect ball of light. Looks of wonder formed on Lauren and Alisha's faces as they shifted toward Ennui. They fed energy into it, seeking to strengthen the destructive spell they had started. The ball swelled and began to fly apart as the balancing spell shredded under the onslaught of too much energy. Her face twisted into a silent shriek as she snarled out, "Too much! I have enough!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Energy crackled and sizzled in her hair. Lightning danced from her fingertips to the ground as she raged and fought to restore the perfect balancer. After long minutes the corona around her dimmed and the ball shrunk back to a dancing globe of white. Ennui looked up at it and smiled. With a gentle little push she nudged it toward the dark energies that were gathered around the stones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Like a ball rolling down a hill the little globe of light started moving slowly, gathering speed as it went. "Get down! The back-blast can kill you!" Alisha yelled. The rest of the team dove for the ground. Ennui stood with her head slightly cocked and a bemused expression as the little ball rolled closer and closer to its target. Mesmerized the rest of the team watched as it gently bumped into the roiling black cloud of energy. There was a firm THUMP and the black energy vanished. Little grey dust devils danced away from the stones and into the grey beings. Eleven of them dropped soundlessly to the dirt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stood shakily and stared at Ennui, "What have you done?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I balanced the gate with a counter-gate," Ennui replied calmly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali laughed as she came up to the group. "Very impressive, battle-mage."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, warrior woman."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali was about to continue the banter when a tickle of danger flared along her nerves. She dove into Ennui and brought them both to the ground. A black ball of energy sailed through where they had been moments before. "Alisha, the rest of you, get down. NOW!" Black energy bursts shot through the air. One clipped Lauren as she dropped slower than the others. "Ennui, can..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, get the rest of them out of here and warn the main team. I'll slow them down a bit and follow right behind you." Ennui's hands moved in a blur as she drew energy and channeled it back at the approaching beings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Patterns blossomed in Kali's head while she scrambled toward the others. Wire frame images of the terrain around her with grey and blue dots scattered about. One of the blue dots moved where she crawled. Three more marked Alisha, Lauren, and Anastasia, and another marked Ennui. The last close dot showed where Danny was making his way toward Anastasia as well. Grey dots appeared, moving toward them on the ridge. Complex movement plans danced through the image as her mind went off on its own and began running various sets of actions. Tiny little figures danced up and down the hillside, first moving one way then the other, always in a jerky kind of fast motion. In each case some or all of the figures on her side dropped and didn't move again. Suddenly one snapped into focus where the little figures danced a simple pattern and then ran for the train.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As soon as Kali reached Alisha she started the plan in motion for real. "Alisha, you move left and around the clump of trees, come up on their flank. Fire into the center of them. There's a leader in there, the third one up from the back and surrounded by the tallest ones. Don't kill it, just knock it out. As soon as the center figures drop break around the back of them and run for the recovery team." Next she slid over to Danny where he was tending to Lauren, "Can you move her? If so, start back for the recovery team. We'll be right behind you. Warn them they have half an hour to get things wrapped up. Anastasia, could you go with them and provide covering magic if necessary?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* should be a bit of tense interplay here - Alisha will Seriously resent Kali telling her what to do right after Ennui showed her up */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stared at Kali for a moment, before nodding in agreement. "Yes, I'll get them out. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cover you. Lissa, can you do magic on your own?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She gave a frightened nod, "What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're with me. We are going around to the right through the bushes over there and provide cover while Anastasia gets the other two out," Kali pointed where they would go. "There's a small group coming up just to the right of those bushes. In the back is a spell user. We need to knock out the group. I'll keep you safe, but you need to knock them out. We don't want to kill them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lissa stared at Kali with wide eyes, "How do you know that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have to trust that I do right now. Maybe I can explain later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Why not kill them? I know how to do that...I think..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It..." the words began to form in Kali's head as she spoke them, "It's a balance issue. If we kill then they can kill as well. If we don't they won't either." Kali wanted to stop and think about this new development but there was no time. Quickly they crawled to the bushes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A very few moments later the predicted group of grey creatures emerged from the trees exactly where Kali had indicated. Lissa turned frightened eyes on her and stammered, "I...I don't know if I can do this. I've never tried to knock them out before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fear chased through Kali's stomach and she wanted to shake her something awful. Instead she reached out and put a hand on her shoulder, "Think back to how you do magic. It had to be terrifying the first time but you did it. You can do it now. I trust you. I can protect you, but if you do this, you will keep more of us alive." Lissa nodded shakily and chanted a few weird sounds almost silently.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stood to the side, watching the advancing line of beings. Lissa cast her first spell before the beings noticed them. The first three dropped soundlessly. Lissa grinned and began readying the next round.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The leader pointed straight at them and began to gesture. His hands were coming up in the final motions when Lissa's spell hit him first. two more dropped, leaving the last two in the line. They stopped uncertainly and stared at Kali. By the time they had decided to advance Lissa had fired her third spell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well done! I knew you could do it. Now we run for the train. I hope Alisha convinced them to get ready."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, I did it!" Lissa laughed almost hysterically. Twenty minutes later they were in sight of the train. It looked like Kali's message had not been taken seriously. The team was still scattered about the site merrily digging and carrying on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What the fuck is this? Weren't you warned? Get on the train right now!" Kali shouted. "Lissa, start warning people you know, get them headed toward the train."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thomas, the official team leader puffed up and bellowed, "Hold it! I am in charge here. I would do nothing to endanger this mission."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then why didn't you listen to Alisha? You know she's an extraction team member."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Her story was preposterous. There has never been any demonic activity on this world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali drew breath to shout just as Lissa spotted a clot of grey figures breaking from the cover of the trees. "Kali, behind you!" She spun and drew energy. Thomas stood rooted to his spot as an energy bolt shattered the ground in front of Thomas. He staggered back stunned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone, fall back to the train." Kali ran at Thomas and shoved him out of the way as another ball shrieked toward him. It clipped her back. Howling in pain she dropped to her knees.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui burst into view behind the grey figures and let fly at them. Several dropped without a sound. Three of the trailing figures turned to rush her but the main force continued toward the train and the workers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lissa drew energy again and fired into the advancing force. Ennui continued to slam magic into them, dropping them two and three at a time. At last the final group slumped to the ground. Ennui dropped to her knees as Anastasia, Lauren, and Danny emerged behind her. Danny helped her up and wrapped an arm around her for support. He hurried her toward the waiting group.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thomas turned scared eyes on Lissa as the battle wound down. "How could I know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alisha got back. You didn't listen to her." Lissa interrupted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talk later," Anastasia interrupted over the top of Lissa. "There are more on the way from behind us. Too many for just the few of us to stop. Thomas, make up for it. Help Kali back to the train. The rest of you, round up the stragglers. We have maybe five minutes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali slid into unconciousness as Thomas lowered her onto a set of foldered down chairs. Danny moved over to her and began working her injury.</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, Kali..." Danny called as he bent over Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Want sleep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, come on, I need you to wake up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sleep now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, Kali, I need you awake."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She pried an eye open and looked into the face of Danny. "Prick," she mumbled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. You want to see it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali couldn't stop the giggles that prompted. "Ouch! Now see what you did, you brat?" She had wanted it to be teasing but it came out more like a whine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, now you are waking up. I need to check your shoulder and I didn't want that to be what woke you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali struggled to sit as she asked, "Are we ok? Did we get everyone?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, everyone's ok. You're the worst of the lot."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about Lauren?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lauren took a hit but it isn't as bad as yours. Ennui's sleeping off whatever she did and Thomas is wanting to apologize as soon as you're ready." Danny's fingers were moving as he spoke and a stab of pain followed. Gently he rolled Kali over and examined it. "Looks like you're going to be ok. No sign of infection or poison. Thank you for back there by the way. You did a great thing getting us all out alive." Swiftly he bandaged the wound and settled her back onto the set of seats that had been rigged as a bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ugh, how long have I been out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Four hours. We arrive at Portal station about an hour from now. And Thomas would like to talk to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I suppose I should give him his chance. It'll only get harder if I put it off. Could you help me sit up? I don't want to be laying down for that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No weakness in front of the troops?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali couldn't tell from his voice if he was serious, mocking or teasing so she just said, "Nope. Must appear super-human at all times. Passing out kind of spoils that though..." She finished through a very shallow laugh which still hurt more than she had hoped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're doing ok with it I think." He finished propping Kali up with a big wad of pillows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thomas hesitantly approached. He leaked nervousness and worry. "I, uh, I'm sorry about all that. I've never seen that kind of attack before. I didn't mean to put anyone in danger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd say it was ok, but it really isn't. You can't take those kinds of chances with people's lives." Kali replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But how was I to know it wasn't hysteria?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thomas," Kali tried to be as diplomatic as she could. "Alisha is an extraction team memeber. Has no one briefed you about this yet? The extraction team only gets sent on missions where a dark forces attack is likely. Our very presence on the mission should have you concerned. When a member of that team raises the alarm, it needs to be taken seriously. No one on the extraction team is known for hysterics in the face of this level of danger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...I didn't..." His eyes turned slightly moist as he tried to explain, "Look, I was in charge because I can coordinate recovery actions pretty well. You're the first person to tell me about an 'extraction team' and who might be on it. I'm not good when it comes to thinking about danger. I'm an archeologist, or at least I was. My skills are knowing what kinds of things are important from an artifact stand point. I didn't sign on for war."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"None of us did. I fear that we are in one whether we want to be or not. Leading in ideal cases is easy. Leading during danger is not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Next time..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't worry about next time. I suspect there'll be a debriefing on this if I know Merris. Things will get worked out and new policies decided after I think."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny walked up while they were finishing. He waited patiently until Thomas had returned to his seat before asking, "Are you still doing ok? You will let me know if you start feeling worse, won't you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes sir, mister doctor sir."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He smiled and said, "And don't you forget it missy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia rose when Danny moved away from Kali. She crossed to him and asked softly, "How is she?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Amazingly well considering the injury she sustained."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would it be ok for me to talk to her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Should be. If she starts looking distracted or pained come and get me. I'm going to check on Lauren."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How is Lauren?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She'll be ok. Her injury isn't quite as bad as Kali's. She's concious as well. I want to be sure she's stable."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked up as Anastasia approached, "Hey."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey yourself," Anastasia looked around nervously. "I wanted to talk to you..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry about that, stepping on your lead like I did."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, that's ok. I'm glad you did, actually."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not doing very well at this. Every extraction has been harder than the last and I keep getting people hurt. It won't be long until I get somebody killed and I won't be able to handle that. I'm resigning as soon as we get back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, but why are you telling me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want you to think about taking over. You're the best I've seen. You kept your head, even when injured and you figured out how to get us all back. You don't have to, but there's no one else on the team that can or will lead." Kali stared at her silently while her mind churned over offer. "You don't have to answer now, in fact maybe it's best if you think carefully first." Anastasia settled back into a nearby chair and tried to still the pounding in her heart. She didn't know what she would do if Kali turned her down. A single tear trickled down her face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The request bounced around in Kali's head. Insecurity on insecurity scrambled into place. Thousands of reasons clawed at her to refuse, to walk away as fast as she could. Terror wrapped icy tendrils in the mix. Words of regret and refusal began to assemble themselves in her mind. She turned to tell Anastasia when she caught sight of the tear as it tracked down her face. Her mind blanked. Suspended between thoughts she stared at the slowly crawling drop of water. Reflected in it she saw death, terror, and so much sorrow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Without thought she wrapped Anastasia in a close hug. The flood gates opened and tears poured from her eyes. Anastasia trembled as she fought to not give sound to the sobs wracking her body. Kali held her, a silent and empty rock caught in the storm. "Daughter, please consider what she asks. You have the strength where she does not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ma, Kali," Kali's mind shrieked. "Why? I don't want to be responsible any more. I don't have that strength."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You do my daughter." Images flashed in Kali's mind. Her first battle and then other extractions where she had always protected those around her. The dark goddess faded into view in Kali's mind. "You carry one of my names. You are Destroyer and Mother. You have always been. Would you deny yourself?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, mom," Kali answered with as much sarcasm as she could manage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Insolent child," the dark vision roared through an enraged face. Kali flinched, then stood her ground. A lifetime of resentment against religion of any kind kept her staring back. As she watched the angry face began to shift and move until the dark goddess began to laugh. "Do you have any idea how rare it is for anyone to stand in the face of my rage?" Her image shimmered and shifted until an older version of Kali stood watching her. "Now you truly are a daughter of mine. You are one of few to receive that status."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You made me, mother, when you gave me everything I ever wanted on the first trip into the void. Yet I..." Kali looked away uncomfortably as she started to speak.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know of your hatred of religion. It causes me no concern. Even as you rage against religion and belief you remember me for what I am. It is more pure than many who dedicate their lives to me. Be at peace with yourself." She smiled warmly, "Now I ask that you consider your friend's request. The decision and choice remain yours." The image faded back out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you ok? I didn't mean to embarrass you," Anastasia whispered softly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Huh, oh..." Kali replied vaguely as she tried to pull her mind back to her surroundings. "I'm ok. No worries on my side. How about you? Are you going to be alright?" She held Anastasia as her sobs subsided. "It's ok, I won't tell. Crying doesn't make you weak, though. Even if I agree with you and won't do it in front of others either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia pulled away slightly. Taking the sleeve of her top she scrubbed at her face and eyes. "I know, but I still can't let the others see it." She stood, shook her hair out so it covered most of her face, and hurried to the washroom. She returned a few minutes later looking almost back to normal. "I'll be ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"About your offer, I've given it a bit of thought and I accept. What do we need to do to make it official?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let Central Station and Dispatch know when we get back, then tell the rest of the team." Anastasia stood and continued, "We can talk more later. For now I'm going to try not to think about any of this for the remaining trip back. Danny said you should try and rest, at least I think that was what he was saying in doctor speak."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll try."</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Kali talking to her new team - after the transfer and before the influx of the large crew */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stood nervously in front of the small group. "There is no easy way to say this. I am stepping down from leader of our team. I have been doing this since the begining and I need to take a break. Don't worry, I'm leaving us in good hands and I am not leaving the team, just stepping down from the lead position. I have asked Kali to step up and she has agreed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stood up and crossed to the front of the group. "I don't know what to more to add. I don't see our procedures changing other than the transfer of leadership. This is a dangerous thing we do and we are the best. All of you have taught me so much. We need to keep relying on each other and doing what we do best."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are the only," Mark mummbled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That may be, but we are still here. We are still alive. So, even if we are the only we are still the best. There are a few things I want to make better. I've told as many rescue mission leaders as I can to find us weapons. We should be looking to do the same every time we go out. The proxy forces won't stay static in what they will use. We can't afford to either. The pressure is continuing to climb. We are being attacked more often and with stronger forces. Ennui has volunteered to pass on as much magical skill as she can. She and Dementia have agreed to come on those missions where Dementia believes things will be very bad. There are a few others we can call on as well. I don't want to over use them. If we burn them out, we all lose." Kali looked down. When she looked up again her eyes were haunted. "I fear some of us will die. There have already been deaths on some of the rescue missions. Remember, we are their best chance. Our purpose is to keep our friends safe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* building Leopardess (K666) */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Additional Notes</p>
<p class="regtxt9">She worked with a fabrication facility in the city. One of the people she met often went to the Dans Macabre. She and Kali started hanging with each other whenever Kali had to check on various items for Leopardess. Need to determine if this woman was in charge or just part of the team working on her parts. The facility is a large foundry and forging facility that provides metal items for many uses in Eternia.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Rainy is her contact. she is about Kali's age and a well muscled. In her time away from the plant she enjoys creating iron work sculpture and ornate work. At the plant she is the head pattern maker. She works closely with Kali on Leopardess to get the various pieces right. She also works closely with her when the need arises for 2 more units.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">pouring over plans, working with Rainy and Ron at the metal works, traveling between Death City and the city, remember Temple Heath probably has the old plan drawers full of blue prints for the various engines in the fleet. in a back section would be copies of recovered ones for various things they may not actually have but want to keep anyway. Kali will search through this, then return to the Realms for more. She will produce her plans in AutoCAD and plot them, then take them to the city for creation. eventually she might be able to upgrade the metal works to CAD based systems as an addition to paper plans. could have the mystery woman help out, but only via computer and IM.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart cleared out a small storage area near the documents and plans room. the desk was soon littered with books, papers and plans. steam tables were open in one book, another had steel alloy properties. old Baldwin prints and newly created drawings were scattered on every flat surface. in the center of the desk was a large monitor and a digitizing pad. immediately at hand was a stained coffee cup leaving rings on whatever it touched. kali stared into the screen while chewing the end of a small plastic brush.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's wrong?" Bart asked as he added thick warm coffee like sludge to the cold mass already in the cup.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"thanks," Kali answered distractedly. At last she looked up, ran a hand through her hair in a very Merris like gesture and said, "It's these damn materials tables. i can't find anything that will get me the boiler pressures i want at the weight i want."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why don't you take a break? we're headed for food and drink."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">kali stared into the screen for a few minutes longer, leaned back, and said, "Sure, yeah..." Suddenly decisive, she stood abruptly and headed toward the door. as they stepped into the night she continued her thoughts, "The most confusing is I don't know whether to redesign everything or restore what's there. there're been so many improvements in boiler and steam technologies since steam locomotives were built. and then there's all the electronic monitoring and controls that could be used to help out. i suppose i could just satisfy myself with a diesel electric and call it good, it's just they aren't nearly as cool looking."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"i want the coolness of the brute force ugly beauty of a steam locomotive. yet the engineer in me wants something efficient and non-polluting. Steam locos were horribly messy and inefficient but they still had a raw beauty that got lost in the transition to diesel and electric technologies."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing says you can't redesign, just it will be much harder. whether you restore or create new the facilities to build the big pieces will have to be set up. i know of a metal working facility in the city, but they only have shops for small things. the biggest they can really handle is replacement track and such. they might be able to ramp up, they are in an industrial section where there would be room for bigger shops."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">they were still discussing it as they made their way to the Temple Heath table. Neither of them saw the mystery woman look up as they passed. a few minutes later she closed her laptop and slipped into the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the next day when kali had a few minutes she headed to her room again. centered on the tablet was an open book with a pencil line under an entry in a another table. scrawled in the margin was, "welded, not riveted". to the side was a cd-rom with "boilercad - new version" scrawled on it in black marker. kali stared at the table, then her fingers flew over the keyboard as she installed the new software. quickly she made changes in various entries and ran her simulation routines again. she had her pressures with a good safety margin besides. puzzled, she walked back into the main area. "Bart, who's been in my office today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No idea, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"someone left me the answer to yesterday's problem... i wanted to thank them..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">She worked on K666 every spare minute, sometimes until she was fainting from fatigue. Blood from skinned knuckles found its way into grease and paint, sweat dropped into wax and finishes, bits of torn skin and hair were riveted into metal plating. All the while the reborn locomotive took shape. She poured over plans, huddled in conversation with Bart and others about insulating materials, bearings, alloys, and all the various pieces and parts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After seven months K666 sat in bay 6 gleaming a glossy black. Brass work threw golden sparks in the light and every piston gleamed. For long moments she stared at her locomotive, for hers it was, born of her will. Slowly she approached the cab and climbed up in. Carefully she worked her way through the steps of starting the great beast. K666 awoke slowly as the heat in her boiler grew. Metal crackled and sang as newly machined and fitted parts were heated for the first time. Intently Kali watched the monitoring equipment she had custom designed, noticing cold spots in the boiler and watching steam pressure and water levels. She made quick notes on a pad for relocation of burner nozzles to even things out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At last the steam and brake pressures were correct and everything was ready. Bart stood grinning at the side of the doors he had just opened. Kali gently eased the regulator open. Like a great beast K666 gave a shudder and slowly clawed her way forward. A touch more on the regulator and she eased forward more quickly. The pulse of the steam throbbed through Kali’s head like the beating of a giant heart. A fierce grin split her face as she hauled on the whistle cord. K666 responded with a howl like a restless soul unchained. With cat like grace she stalked into the morning. Sunlight flashed off the insignia painted on the cab, one symbol for Temple Heath Yards and another for the Death City Rail Road. When it splashed onto the tender the springing snow leopard painted there seemed to come to life and ripple in the daylight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* introduction of larger team */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* replace Ennui with Anastasia */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi led the group across the station to a siding where a motley array of rolling stock sat. On closer inspection it was actually linked up to form a train of sorts. Gaudy circus stock from all times in history sat beside other rolling stock that would have looked at home in a post apocalypse world. Several people were working on various coaches, scrubbing, painting, and repairing signs of recent damage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi turned to one, a thin woman with purple and blonde streaked through black hair, "Ennui..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sammi, Jemima, what's happening?" She asked watching the group of people following the two women.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Got a present for K... for QBC. Is she around?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"QBC is inside, in the conference car. Ummm, the one with the jumping tigers painted around the windows." Ennui added at Sammi's puzzled look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Behind her Sammi heard someone mutter, "QBC? What the...?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She smiled as she turned, "Don't ask. You'll find out soon enough. Wait here a few would you?" She sauntered over to the train and entered. Stepping over the gear in the entryway she made her way to the open section in the center of the car. There she found Kali studying an array of drawings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jemima, heya." Kali smiled in greeting. "What's the what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Remember that new crew you asked for? We found it for you." Sammi laughed as Kali looked out the window in the direction Sammi pointed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"ALL of them? That's an army, not a crew..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well it's kind of a package deal of one hundred fifty-eight survivors. There were a few more at the start. We found them on a world where the Younger Ones were engaged in their usual game of proxy war. Yeah, I know, normally they'd go off in Sacred Units, but they all want to kick some ass instead. The Lady thought you could help them out. Besides, you've got a pretty big train here and I know you can find more rolling stock if you need it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali shook her head violently, "No, no way. I can't be responsible for them." All the while chanting in her head, 'Mother, no, please, no.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Daughter, yes you can, you must. They need this as much as you need.' The dark voice of power rolled in her head.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Mother...' Kali thought in agony. she dropped her head briefly in defeat, "Ok, let me tell my crew and I'll be out. Tell Ennui crew meeting inside, stat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once everyone was around the table Kali began, "Looks like we have the crew we needed." She waved toward the window, "Maybe even more than we needed. Sammi and Jemima just brought them over."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do they know how things work yet?" "How many are there?" Questions flew from around the table until Kali waved them into silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hold up a bit," she smiled to take the sting off. "I don't know the what of it yet. There are one hundred fifty-eight of them. I have no idea what they know of Eternia and Death City. We're going to have to assimilate them into our teams and find out. They all came from the same place. Another place of the Proxy Wars. They want to fight back. We have to teach them about the balance of things before we let them into combat." She stared down at her hands for along while. With a weary sigh she continued, "We'll divide them into teams based on previous experience and get them settled. We know the routine, it's just a bigger crowd this time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You ok boss?" Ennui asked as she watched Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I will be, just not at the moment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can take care of this if you want..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I need to make sure they know who's Queen Bitch in Charge from the start. Once we get them split up you can each take care of your new team. Ah hell, it's not like I haven't done this..." She stood and untied her boiler suit top from around her waist. She shrugged her arms into the sleeves and zipped it up over her crop top. Properly armored up she strode to the carriage door and out into the sunshine. The rest of her crew followed a few paces behind. As she walked they saw her assemble her public mask.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When she reached the crowd she began, "So, I hear there's a few of you who want to kick demon ass out here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah!" "Right on!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good!" She smiled at them. "We are going to break you up into groups and explain what I am about to tell you more completely, but first I want to give you the basic what of Death City. In the guide books, if there were any, it would be listed as, 'Death City. The Ageless. City of Power. East of Heaven and west of Hell, it stands at the center of Eternia, the realm between.'."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A woman shouted from the center of the crowd, "Well that sounds all mystical and shite, but what does it really mean? Where are we and what happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'I thought I could write better than that, how cliche, the token heckler from the crowd to force exposition...' She smiled ruefully at herself and answered, "Death City is a place Between. It is not the land of the living nor is it the land of the dead. The Death City Charter is to recover the beauty of the Realms before it is destroyed by war and disaster. These things of beauty are then placed back into Realms that are in need of them, that will treasure and use them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Our friends died getting us here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know and that happens all too often. That is the usual way of arriving here though. Your friends weren't the only ones to die. They just chose to go to the Havens. It seems the rest of you petitioned for a way to strike back and that is what I can offer you. There are a few rules that we have to follow though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rules, bah. I don't need this shit." A large man scoffed from the back. He might have been handsome except for a large nose that looked like it had been broken and flattened several times in his life. He stood half a head or more over most of the others with wide shoulders, heavily muscled arms and chest, tapering to a naroow waist and solid legs. Warm tingles fluttered in Kali's lower belly as she looked at him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She forced herself to stop staring befor saying, "You're right. You can go whenever you wish. I'm not here to recruit you. I can offer you a chance to strike back, but by all means, go find other arrangements if you can. Anyone else who isn't interested can go with you." There was a smattering of laughter from the crowd. "For those of you who might be interested here's the quick what of it. The charter of Death City, where you are right now, is this: We rescue beauty from the ruins of the Proxy wars. We are not to directly interfere with or attack the combatants of either side. If we are attacked then we can fight back. If Death City draws first blood then our people pay a price in the same level of damage or death as what they caused. That said we are an Extraction Team. We go in and rescue the rescuers when things go wrong. So we often fight since we usually aren't called unless Death City people have already been hurt or killed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And who might you be?" the large man challenged.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're still here? I thought you weren't interested. I'm the Queen Bitch in Charge. Who might you be?" Kali replied, fighting not to lick her lips at the thought of him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali heard several muttered "QBC...no wonder..." comments from the crowd as well as a few more laughs before the large man answered. "I am Petrov."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well then Petrov, are you in or out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to strike back, so I'm in. For now. And what kind of name Queen Bitch anyway? Don't you have a real name?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled enigmatically, "Yes, and those who remain will get to know it. There are a couple more rules for this team that I should mention right now. We don't waste the living on the dead. If one of us dies on a mission we don't try to go back for the body. Also the mission is the critical item. If we are rescuing another team we finish that first. So if some of us get cut off, we are on our own until the primary objective is complete. We won't risk anyone outside our own in a bad situation."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali let the mutterings and comments flay for several minutes before she held up her hand. When the crowd didn't notice right away Ennui gave a piercing whistle, "Listen up people."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali waited while Ennui held fingers to lips to give another whistle if it was needed. Once the crowd had wound down to silence Kali asked, "Now that you know the basic what of it, who is still in? Those of you planning to stay will be split into small groups and assigned a crew chief. They will explain the details and answer your questions." She waited as the group shuffled their feet and watched to see if any would leave. She was surprised when none did. "Ok then, count off by numbers, one through sixteen, then start again. There will be sixteen groups of you."</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">/* Extraction Mission - much later */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stepped off the platform into the dining car (probably something ornate and circus-like - i still see her train as being a mad-max mix of circus cars and oddly assembled bits from everywhere - need to have descriptions of various train bits as they fit). where the team leaders waited. She sat in her chair at the head of the table and stared at the stack of printouts she had brought in for long moments before looking up at the waiting faces. One look at her face told them it was going to be a hard one. Seeing the looks she smiled and said, "Well, let's get to it shall we? We like challenges, remember?" She </p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* new crew issues */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* squad - ten person teams, Platoon (maybe) - 5 ten person squads, company - the full team, about 3 platoons or a6 squads */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked up from her screen and growled, "Arg, Leopardess doesn't have the power to pull the new train. I suppose we could go to diesel-electrics, they are easier to control. It's just they lack that primitive elegance of Leopardess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* add in decision tree about how to solve the issue - build another steam and use computer systems to slave, go with an all diesel solution, go with a hybrid - instrument Leopardess and slave diesel boost units, multiple steam with additional engineers... */</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">/* Petrov */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Petrov - promotion to second */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked up from the stacks of paper spread out on the table in front of her. "Ah, Petrov. Anastasia and I just had a very interesting conversation..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't like that..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Petrov..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You need to hear my..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Petrov!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can't just..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Petrov, Shut UP!" He stopped finally. "Sit down, I have something I want to talk to you about." Petrov settled himself into the chair at the far end of the table and watched Kali. "Anastasia is stepping down as leader of your team. She is quite aware that you were right in your handling of the situation. She wants me to name you the new squad leader."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wha-what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have the respect of the others, you are smarter than you let on, and you keep cool in a crisis. You are quite qualified, I just need a few assurances. First, I expect you to question me as you questioned her. Second, any such questioning will be in private. Third, I won't always defer to your viewpoint. In those cases you will carry out the instructions I issue. If you can abide by those rules you will be my second in command and the leader of your team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Second in command, so soon after joining? Won't this alienate your older team members?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"None of them want it. There are sixteen from before and over one hundred and fifty that came with you. And, so you know, Anastasia is leaving the team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Leaving, completely?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's returning to regular Recovery Missions. Could you let her know you agreed and have her gather the rest of the team leads?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Petrov and Kali talking about team structure */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Permission to speak freely, ma'am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What the fuck was that, Petrov?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm just trying to be the good XO, ma'am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's just fucked up. Don't start yanking my chain with that military crap! And don't call me ma'am, I hate being called ma'am. And what's this XO bullshit, anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A way to yank your chain. And a way to start a discussion about needing a bit more structure now that there are so many of us. You started military like structure when you split us into squads. You have borrowed the other good parts as well, such as reprimand in private, respect those under your command, challenge command descisions when necessary and always in a respectful manner. I think what needs to happen is for you to publicly acknowledge that as the model. It will give us direction and stability in the chaos we are facing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, what have you done with the real Petrov? The real Petrov wouldn't propose any of this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes he would, actually, if he thought it would be a good idea. Where I am from military service was required. I hated it for the most part, but there were a few good things to come from it as well. I learned I could rely on myself and my team. The military looks out for their own. You know what is expected of you and you know you have a place to stay, food to eat, and basic necessities are provided. There are sixteen teams of ten people. The old style of informality won't work if we all have to go out on a really big mission. You can't keep leading from the front. When you were a small team it might have made sense, but not any more. I know you seek death, any with eyes can see it. As our leader, you can no longer be that selfish. We need you to believe in and trust us to take care of ourselves and we need to trust and believe you are doing the same."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I won't send someone out to die. I won't do that, not if I'm not taking the same risks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have to. That's what being the leader is all about."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I never asked to be the fucking leader!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you are and we rely on that. We need you to be making the best possible decisions for us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Petrov  - as second, early in the sequence of large missions*/</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* tighten up - Petrov is blunt and direct */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petrov stood and folded his arms in the doorway. "You should not come this time boss."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Out of my way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know you seek death, any with eyes can see it. As our leader, you can no longer be that selfish. We need you to believe in and trust us to take care of ourselves and we need to trust and believe you are doing the same.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't let you go out there. When you were just a small squad it made sense for you to lead from the front. Now we are a small army and you are the one we choose to follow. If something happens to you out there we are the worse for it. Sure someone else could do as well or better than you." Petrov ignored the ice forming in her eyes and continued, "however you are the one we choose to trust. No one else has that. You need to stay here where we know you are safe and where we know you can keep an eye on us. We need you to believe in and trust us to take care of ourselves and we need to trust and believe you are doing the same. I know you seek death, any with eyes can see, but you need to live for more than just yourself now." He gestured at the head mounted camera and headset, "Besides, all this fancy new shite will keep you in the loop. Your strength is planning and tactics, use them for us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bullshit, my strength is making it up as I go. I can't plan my way out of a bag."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So make it up as we go from here. We need you to be safe. Something feels very wrong here. And you know if I can feel it, it has to be bad."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">kali - voice breaking in anguish - i can't send someone else out to die. i won't do that.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petrov - you have to, that's what being the leader is about. we can't afford to loose you, so you have to let us do and risk for you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* to entire team */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do the others seem to hate us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They don't hate us. It's just that we show up when things are going to be bad. Most of Eternia only sees us when they are or will be in extreme danger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* talking to Ennui later */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Kali is freaked because she has serious hots for Petrov - she is still dealing with parts of her new attraction to boys */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">KALI: This is different. Sometimes I like sex with boys. There's something about that hard, sharp, fast energy that can be an interesting change, but I don't fall for guys. Petrov interests me and it troubles me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* could consolidate this into the discussion after their indiscretion, that's really going to flip her switches because of what she wants after the fact */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Indiscretion</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* "drunken indiscretion" - a fair amount of time after the assembly of the full team, but still a while before the endings */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shit, shit, shit! I can't believe I missed that," Kali cursed as she paced the company car main room. She reached into the front cabinet, pulled out a bottle of slivovitz, and took a long pull. It burned like fire going down, but tasted wonderful across her tongue. She took a smaller sip and rolled it around her mouth, savoring the fermented plum flavor and the harsh bite of it. As the alcohol started to take the edge off her rage and fear, her pacing slowed and finally stopped, leaving her staring out the window at the void beyond the train.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bottle was two-thirds empty and she was still staring out the window when Petrov entered from the forward passage. "I can't believe I missed that," she said in a quiet, sad voice. Her hand moved the bottle to her mouth and she took another pull.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But we recovered from it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And nearly lost an entire squad."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But we didn't. You got us out, without casualties."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali spun to face him. "How many more times can I do that? What happens when I fail?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then some of us will die. It's the way of it," his voice was calm and mater of fact. It goaded her and saddened her in equal measure.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's not acceptable!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petrov grabbed her shoulders and shook her lightly. "It is the way of it. You know that, you who seek death in the Lady's service."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not acceptable for others to die!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He pulled her against his chest, surprised when she let him. She was surprised that she let him as well, and more surprised at how good it felt to be held close by him. "Death happens. It is the other side of the dance. You showed me that." One hand unconciously stroked her hair. It stopped the instant he realized what he was doing. Kali rubbed her head against his still hand, wanting the warmth of the gesture to return. She turned her head and managed to get another long drink from her bottle before he carefully removed it from her grasp. "Bitter experience has proven this doesn't help." He leaned over and set the bottle on the window ledge before wrapping his arms around her again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* they sleep together after getting drunk trying to unwind from the disaster they just barely averted. in the morning they both recognize the impossibility of a relationship and the mistake this was from a tactical/team related basis. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This was a mistake," they both said at once. Petrov moved to get up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stay," Kali said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that a command, ma'am?" Petrov asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it's a request from a woman who wants to stay in the fantasy for a little bit longer." He laid back on the bed and Kali draped herself over his massive chest again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* what surprises Kali the most is the weird feeling of safety and comfort that comes from being held by someone of Petrov's size */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Ennui - how was he? Kali - mind numbingly wonderful. he was rough enough, considerate enough, and skilled enough. it was the best sex i've ever had. we didn't have to worry about breaking each other and that made it all the more amazing */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We had a few dirnks and were talking, then hugging, then..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He shouldn't have..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I jumped him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You...jumped...him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. He was being reasonable and thoughtful, saying we shouldn't but I really wanted to. He held me and it felt so safe and warm and wonderful and it made me insanely hot."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So he didn't force you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"More like I sort of forced him, the first time anyway. After that, well, it seemed very mutual. We spent the trip back in his room. Gods it was so wonderful!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't understand, what are you so unhappy about then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hate that my body craves it again. The cuddling and holding even more than the awesome sex. All my previous flings have been just that. Hello, let's fuck, see you around. With Petrov, I want to cuddle up in his arms, snuggle in with him at night, and lose myself in his warmth. But I hate that stereotyped response in myself, and I still want Merris, and I'm afraid I'll lose too much of myself if I give in to this Petrov obsession at all. Gods, I got so annoyed with friends of mine when they'd find a man attractive because he was big, strong, and confident. Now I'm following the same fucked up stereotype. I hate it!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't really tell you what to do. You need to figure out what you need and what you want. Then decide if your wants can be met while your needs are. I will say you need to talk to Merris and Petrov."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't want to hurt anyone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"One of the sad truths of life is you will give and recieve hurt. The only thing you can do is try to make it on the best terms. If this situation sorts itself out through random chance, there will be a great deal of hurt to all involved. You need to figure out what you want and need, then work it out, and fairly soon."</p>

<p class="pagecaption">Intermediate 5</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* first time the team fights minions of the proxy gods that look like them */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Kali and Petrov had managed to stay apart until this event, they connect again and will remain partners until Kali's end */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need to sort out how Merris/Kali/Petrov works - determine if Kali is the only one to have troubble with a three-way relationship or if it effects all of them */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali was staring out the window of the command car. The void slipped silently past her empty gaze. She raised the bottle of slivovitz she clutched in her left hand to her lips and gulped down a large swallow. The face of the first proxy victim swam in her vision, as if mirrored in the glass of the window. The scene was vivid in her mind, the horde of men and women charging at her team, the shock on the team's faces, her barked commands to attack, and the crumpling form of the woman as she had slashed her throat out. Her right hand traced where the blood had spattered her face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali?" She flinched at Petrov's voice, then turned to see him enter from the next car. "You never served in the military or saw combat, did you?" He saw her face harden and the breath she drew to speak. He cut her off with, "You are a brilliant commander and your grasp of tactics and strategy is mystical. You have saved us from so many things with your skills, but fighting others of your own kind is different. It changes you. Some people can handle it, others die because they cannot. You have to find a way to deal with it or it will consume you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I still see her face..." Kali whispered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petrov moved closer to her, hesitated, then reached out and offered her his arms. She stood frozen for a long moment, then let him enfold her. "You will, for a while anyway. It will fade some as you adjust."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His scent shot fire through her, bringing surging lust with it and forcing a small whimper from her before she could clamp down on herself. His eyes bored into hers for a moment, then he dropped a hand to grab her ass as he lowed his lips to hers in a hungry kiss. He broke free just long enough to whisper, "Celebrate life. It's a way to cope."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she wants it hard from him - "Fuck me like there's no tomorrow!" */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* afterwards they talk about the first kill */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Does it ever get better?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The intensity fades, but if it gets easier, then you worry. The people I know who aren't bothered became or started as sociopaths, and that never ends well. My first one is still prominent in my memory. It was my first tour in a police action, a pretty euphamism for a war that we weren't officially fighting. This kid, eightenn at the most, came at me from an alley as my patrol was passing. I spun, shot, and hollered at my team as the grenade he had been holding rolled free. If his body hadn't landed on it, we wouldn't be having this talk." His words were casual, but his face looked old as he spoke. "I see that kid's face every time I sleep after combat." Kali pulled tight against him, holding herself pressed hard aganst him until her arms started to shake with fatigue.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she will also talk to Alice after this confrontation - taking her the necklace worn by the woman she killed for analysis - need to figure out who points her at Alice */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* still need to figure out how Merris plays into all of this */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* she will really rely on Enui and Dementia for advice and support as she tries to come to terms with her dual attracions and the situation in general */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Endings</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Petrov entered the car and found Kali staring out into the passing void. When she made no sign of noticing him he said, "Ma'am?" A few minutes later, "Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Petrov," she replied. Dementia would have recognized the empty, distant voice, but it was one Petrov had never heard. "Do not ask the universe for a purpose, it may grant your wish. If you already have, pray it never answers you," Kali spoke without turning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned a bit, twisted her mouth into a brief, grimaced smile that fled almost before he saw. "I asked once, and now I have been answered with the solution to this war." Kali shivered. "Our indiscrete relationship meant far more to me than I dared let on. Thank you." She turned back to the window. "I have one regret, that I could never believe my friends love me as much as they do. I wish I had time to remedy that failing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali?" real fear entered Petrov's voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would ask two things of you, Petrov."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stopped and he waited. At last Petrov prompted, "Yes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Keep them safe when I am no longer able to. And don't forget me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Forget you? Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are three avatars in this war. The one for the powers of 'light', one for the powers of the 'dark', and one for Eternia. When we meet this last time, we must cancel each other out. Keep everyone from interfering, it would only cost more lives." Kali stared out the window in silence for a long time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I suppose you have to do this." It was as much a statement as a question.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned toward him a tiny bit and gave a very small nod. "All my life I wanted to die. You saw it, and I knew it. Now that it is upon me, I want more than anything to live."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have friends and lovers now, holding you here." She nodded again. "Does Merris know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Again Kali nodded. "She was there when Dementia and I figured it out. If you could make sure she doesn't do anything foolish, I'd really appreciate it." Petrov noded. A tear slipped down the side of her face. "One last thing, if you could..." Petrov waited. "Hold me and tell me everything will be alright."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned uncertainly as he akwardly gathered her in his massive arms. She clung to him and shook as she cried for all the might have beens of her life. He gathered her up, carried her to a chair, and settled into it with her in his arms. They sat in silence for hours as the sounds of the train continued around them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At last Kali pulled back a bit and said, "It is time. Gather the squad commanders in the dining car. I will be there in a moment." Slowly his arms released her. She rose and walked to the bath room. A few minutes later she followed him from the car.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali strode into the dining car, set a thick stack of papers on the front table, and sat. She </p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need actual phase 1 in here and lead up to this last bit */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Its about balance - there is an avatar for the "good', an avatar for the "bad", so we got an avatar of the Lady. We can continue fighting this escalated war or it can be returned to the way it should be. But the balance has to remain, to end their avatars we must loose ours as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I told you how I begged for a vision, a purpose so very long ago. It has finally been answered and now I no longer want to go. But this has to end, before so many more of us die." her eyes were empty and old in a face etched with age and sadness. "It is time to end this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stepped away from her friends and began a slow dance of seduction. Softly and slowly it built until it was a siren call to the dark and light. Pale tendrils swirled out from her and drew the opposing leaders closer to her. Black ropes and shimmering white flowed in toward her until she danced in a tangle of it. The dark priest smiled and pulled on his web, the priestess of light laughed and tugged on her strands, and Kali danced on, unaffected.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The smiles faded into masks of rage, then fear as Kali danced a swirling spiral tug, pulling the two opposing leaders closer and closer to her. Sweat poured off her as energy snapped and crackled around her. The Death City forces pulled back as the fringes pulsed over them, raising hair in static laden tufts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali sent a last sad look at her friends as she pulled the two leaders into her arms. A soft pop was all they heard as the three ceased to be. The demonic and angelic hordes bearing down on them paused, then broke and ran. The dark portal rapidly faded leaving only a grey stone wall where once it had been. The pillar of light snapped off, as if a giant switch had been flipped. The forces that had been running for their gates slid to a stop and milled about, uncertain of where to go or what to do.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Eternia forces drew back in a somber procession, entered their train, and headed back to Eternia. Here and there people sat together, holding each other, crying. Others stared resolutly ahead either trying not to cry or with slow tears tracking down their faces.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Beyond</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali returned to consciousness in a spectacular hall. Sunlight and a warm breeze streamed in through windows of patterned metal, thick rugs cusioned her feet, and an enormous table was set before her with food and drink. She turned swiftly as a voice spoke from behind her, "I have used you, daughter. Yes, you accepted it with grace, dignity, and a willingness I had not expected. Even so, I used you, and cruelly too. Eternia is supposed to be a place of healing and rest, instead you faced nightmares far beyond what you saw in the Realms, and I owe you for it." Kali stood speachless as the Lady paced in front of her. "Is there something I might grant that would repay you? Perhaps return you to your friends, or to the Realms?" Kali shuddered at the thought of the Realms. "You would be as you are now. None would know you had come from a different background."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like to remain your avatar."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I cannot ask that of you, I would prefer not to do that to you, and it is far more cruel than you deserve. I would prefer to grant you peace and rest!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* more discussion - than maybe this result */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am so tired in this incarnation. My head knows my friends loved me, yet I can't feel it. I just want to rest, to forget, to take another turn in Eternia and see if, maybe, I can accept and feel less empty and cold."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can grant that. Rest here and slowly forget. When you are ready we will send you back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May I ask one thing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Daughter?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please let me remember how to dance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Done. You will always remain my daughter, even as you forget. Now picture a new you for your return and we shall let the resting begin."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="pagecaption">Katya</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She awoke in darkness, with the smell of dust heavy in the air. Faintly, in the distance, she heard noises and then a voice from much closer, "Petrov, there's no one here. Dispatch got it wrong this time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Keep looking. Dispatch has never been wrong about survivors," a deep voice shouted from the distance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something in it was familiar and reassuring and prompted her to struggle against the dark. She pulled her arms up in front of her and shoved against the weight pinning her down and shouted as she did, "Hey, I'm down here!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Petrov, over here!" The sounds of digging and scraping came from above her, releasing dust trickles into her face. Moments later a large piece of metal was hauled upward and off her. Light poured into her eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A huge hand touched her face and startled her eyes open. A bear of a man knelt above her, shading her eyes with his bulk, his massive right hand gently touching her face. "Kali?" his voice was hoarse and puzzled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Who?" she asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sorry, your voice reminded me of someone I knew. Are you alright? Anything hurt or feel like anything is broken?" He asked as he pulled his hand away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think so," she tried to move. "My legs are pinned, but I think they're ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's get you out of there. Tom, get the lifting gear over here and someone call for Danny." He started pulling bit sof rubble away from her, taking in the shredded clothes and dust covered figure. Once the lifting gear was in place the heavy steel beam was lifted free of her legs. "Danny, can we move her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny asked the same questions of the girl, then replied, "I think you can move her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're going to lift you out now. Are you ready?" When she nodded Petrov and two others carefully lifted her out of the hole and set her on a nearby stretcher.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I can stand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It would be better if you took it slowly," Danny replied.</p>
