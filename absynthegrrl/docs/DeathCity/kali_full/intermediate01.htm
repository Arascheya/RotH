<p class="regtxt5">/* first period, end of adaptation reaction, and need to triage how much she can do and still have enough time to sleep */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* various segments in the earlier sections of the war - this will eventually become chapter(s) */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fall back behind this line," Kali pointed to an area on the map.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why? The enemy is coming through over here," Alyssa pointed to a different section of the map. "We need to stop them before they get to our people."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something else is coming in through a second gate. They will engage the dark forces. We can stand back and hold the stragglers back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alyssa looked at Anastasia. "Here she goes again!" She watched Anastasia react and continued, "Don't tell me you believe her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Has she been wrong?" Alyssa's eyes went hard as she turned and stalked away. Anastasia was about to turn on Kali until she saw the hurt and pain in the other woman's eyes. Instead, she let out a heavy sigh and began issuing new instructions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali walked out into the night and started for the line she had pointed to on the map. She crossed it and slipped deeper into the wreckage around her, headed toward the second portal, the one of the unknown force.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* building Leopardess goes in here somewhere, along with Return to the Realms and recruiting Tracy */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Kali should have some type of physical failing - like trying to pull herself up a broken ladder out of danger - that she can't quite do - it will prompt her to start going to Freda's */</p>
