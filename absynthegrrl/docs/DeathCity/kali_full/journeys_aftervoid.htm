<p class="pagecaption">Journeys - After the Void</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris had made it easy to make the trip back to Temple Heath and the trip provided ample distraction from the thoughts chaotically banging around in Kali's head. The trip down from the Portal was particularly intense as she had to keep the braking right so the train wouldn't speed up and lose control. There was a reprieve when she had to navigate the local track into the city, to drop the wounded at the main hospital. There was an additional reprieve when she arrived back at Temple Heath Yards. Bart came striding from the repair sheds as she slowed the train to a stop on one of the sidings. "Merris called, said you had a spot of trouble in the Void." His eyes took in her condition as he approached her, "Guess she was understating as usual. What did you do, take on the entire force of evil?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, yes. A large number of them anyway." Sammi replied. "Kali, you going to be ok? I'd like to hop a train back to the hospital and check on a couple of friends." She stopped when she saw Kali's white face. "I can stay if you'd like though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I think I'll be ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you're sure then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok Sammi. You go, I'll be alright. It's just reaction to everything." Sammi turned and walked toward Central Station.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Images surged in her mind at the reminders. This time, with no adrenaline haze to keep them distant, she remembered the feel of tearing flesh, the screams of the dying, and the vigor with which she attacked. As she stood trying not to cry, Bart came closer, "I'm sorry Kali. I was just kidding. Looks like your first trip was a hard one. Do you want to talk about it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mutely she shook her head. "It’s ok. If you ever do, I'd be glad to listen. It changes you, a journey into the Void." She tried to smile her thanks while she struggled to get her voice under control. Then as calmly as she could she explained the damage she had found and what she had done to repair it. While she narrated she led him to the trouble spots and pointed out her repairs. "Good job, that. You can help me fix her up starting tomorrow. Right now I expect you're tired from the run and wanting to clean up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Again she nodded. Bart turned and headed back to the sheds after a long look at her. Suddenly everything she had needed to do was done, leaving her standing in the waning sunshine with nothing left to distract her mind. For a moment she leaned against the engine, weak with reaction. Then she pushed herself away and made her way toward home. Everything felt wrong, the clothes she was wearing felt more baggy and ill-fitting than they had that morning, her footsteps were uncertain and clumsy, and her mind kept wandering, replaying the battle over and over in her head.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">She avoided the few people she saw on her way back to her place. After trudging up the stairs she stumbled to the bathroom and started a hot bath. She slid into the warm water and was just starting to relax when she noticed all the stuff floating around her. Disgusted she sprang upright and whipped the curtain around the tub. Her toes plucked the drain plug out as her hands twisted the water on full. First she rinsed as much muck from the flight suit as possible, then slithered out of it. Her sports bra was too large and floppy over her chest and her underwear slid down with the flight suit. She half fell and half collapsed into the bottom of the tub as she realized how much she had changed. Her breasts were small and tight again, her stomach flat and trim, and the hated wrongness no longer peeked from the thatch of dark red hair at her crotch. A hysterical laugh surged from her as her hands verified what her eyes were telling her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still in shock, she pulled herself up, staggered from the tub, and swung the bathroom door closed. A stranger stared at her from the full length mirror on its back. Gone was the roundness of her mom's face. Her cheek bones were higher and more sharply defined. The ski jump end of her nose had flattened out and her jaw line was sharper and harder. Her eyes had gone from bland blue to warm grey. Flared hips, trim waist, wide shoulders and a dancer's body had replaced the lumpy hybrid of before. She turned and twisted in front of the mirror, examining her new form. Slowly she settled to the floor and opened her legs. Gently she spread and touched the changes. Everything seemed right, including the growing warmth, wetness, and pleasant tingles her explorations started. Awkwardly and hesitantly she teased pleasure from herself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cold water dripping from her hair finally reminded her to step back into the shower and finish washing and drying off. Once she had finished she walked up to her bedroom for clothes. By the time she reached the room a wild giddiness had replaced the shock. She danced around the room naked. For the first time in her life she didn't care if anyone could see in from outside.</p>

</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The echo of a large gong reverberating through the room jerked her to a stop with her eyes darting around the room. Bart's voice echoed up the stairs, "Kali, hey, are you home?" Frantically she dashed to the closet and grabbed for an oversized t-shirt. Throwing it on she flung herself down the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm here. Coming, just a minute..." She cleared the bottom of her stairs just as Bart reached the top of the entry stairs. "Uh, hi..." she started and trailed off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You looked pretty knocked about today when I saw you. I thought I'd stop by and make sure you were doing all right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you find me?" She pulled her arms across herself self consciously, then quickly dropped them as she realized what that would show off. Suddenly she felt naked and exposed. She backed quickly into the sitting room, held her shirt down as she dropped into the pillows and covered herself to her chin in them. It helped a little bit and she started to relax.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I asked Jo at the Adam and Eve. She pointed me here. You still look like you're not doing too well. You sure you don't want to talk about it?" Bart slowly followed her. Carefully he sat in the chair by the window. "This place changes everyone. Often not as quickly as you changed, but you seem to have your own momentum. Extreme things in the Void speed it up as well. It can be hard," He settled back in the chair with an air of calm waiting, content to let her take her time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The word changes echoed through her mind. Terror followed it swiftly as she thought about the biggest change of all. Suddenly she wondered if she would get periods, be fertile, and have to worry about pregnancy. She couldn't think of anyone she could ask. No one knew her past and she wasn't sure she wanted to tell anyone either.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An icy fear of Bart crept into the terror. He had seen her in just her shirt. Worse, he would have noticed how good she looked. In an instant she knew the shadows were lost to her. People would notice her. Bart had noticed her. She didn't know what she would do if he found her attractive. Under the pillows she shivered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali? Are you ok? Is there any way I can help?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She backed further into the pillows until the wall stopped her. She tried to shake her head but it came out in a series of twisting, jerking motions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali?" Worry colored his voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Gods, what's happening to me? Look at me. This morning I was dumpy, ugly me and now, now I'm...oh gods." The tears spilled over and traced silent tracks down her cheeks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You weren't ugly before, but you thought you were and you hid behind it, didn't you? It let you avoid attention." He stopped as her saw her eyes widen in fear. An icy fist grabbed her chest. Black spots danced in front of her eyes as she struggled against the dark waves of panic the thought of attention brought surging to the surface. "Kali?" Bart tried again. He sat rigidly still in the chair, afraid to move at all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His stillness allowed her enough control to finally get a small breath of air. Mutely she nodded slowly as the black spots faded slightly. "Attention was never my friend," she began in an almost silent whisper. "From little onward, I only got noticed for the things I did wrong. The shadows became my friends as I learned it was better to not be noticed. I don't want anyone attracted to me. I don't want to have to deal with it. I don't want it!" Her voice started to climb into hysterics.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, shh, it's ok. It's really ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no, you don't..." She stopped suddenly, not wanting to reveal anything. "It's not ok. Why did this happen? Big Joe said we look like we see ourselves. Why do I look like this? I didn't see myself this way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He only mentioned part of it. We think we're who and what we were in the Realms, but it isn't true. This place lets us be what we could have been. I bet somewhere inside you wanted to be athletic and you wanted to look good, but you couldn't let yourself. The Lady makes adjustments as well, things to help you heal or grow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What I could have been...Gods, I..." She stopped suddenly. She huddled silently for long minutes. "I don't know how to handle this. I was a shadow in the Realms. I just want to be a shadow. I want to be left alone," she continued in a broken voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry. I want to tell you that you can remain a shadow here, but I can't. You haven't been since you arrived. Jo told me of you dancing with Sammi and Jemima. You have already made a name for yourself by what you did today."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His words pulled her eyes up from the pillow she had been staring at. His eyes were sad and his face troubled at what he said. "What I did today. Oh gods...I did things, I've become things today..." Tears welled in her eyes and she pulled in on herself once more. Bart waited patiently hoping she would continue. The memories pushed forward, bringing with them the predator that had let her rend and kill. It ripped into her terror like a kitten into a mouse. In the fleeing wake of the terror hysterical joy bubbled to the surface. "I killed, with my bare hands, and I fucking enjoyed it!" Hysteria tinged her triumphant confession. Her voice dropped back to a broken whisper as joy gave way to confusion, "What's happening to me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are changing, becoming..." Bart paused.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Becoming..." She looked up and continued, "Becoming what? I see the blood and flesh on my hands even now. But even worse I remember the pure joy," her face twisted into bitterness and disgust. "The joy I felt in ripping them to shreds with my hands." For a moment the mask slipped and he could see in her eyes the fight between the joy of the killing and the remorse and fear it caused her. "I liked it Bart. That's the worst of it. I liked shredding those things, feeling the flesh tear under my claws... even now part of me still likes it, wants to do it again. How can that be right? It's not anything right in any of the things I know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took all Bart's will not to flinch at the predator he saw looking out through his new friend's eyes. It was more terrible than her terror had been. It faded slowly, leaving her behind, but he could almost see it still pacing in the cage behind her eyes. "I'll tell you something few know. In the Realms I was the class nerd. Everyone picked on me because I preferred to use my brain and I was a skinny little thing. I can't begin to describe the rage I felt every time I looked at my tormentors. When I arrived here I got a chance to see what it was like to be strong. It was a new chance but I had to learn what to do with that rage inside. Change always brings fear and uncertainty. Trust the Lady if you don't trust yourself. She thinks you belong here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A new chance..." she whispered. Suddenly she thought of something and began laughing almost hysterically, "No wonder Merris looked at me funny when I came back. And I thought it was cuz I was covered in ick..." They laughed for long minutes and then Kali lapsed back into a pensive silence. Bart sat and waited until she at last said, "I should try and get food I guess. Gods, what about everyone else? I don't know if I can see them right now. I feel so...fragile."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't have to. Do you have anything around here? I can make you something or go out and get us something..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, maybe I should, I don't know. I guess I should try. The fear is so seductive... If I don't try it'll be the Realms all over again. But they won't even know me, will they?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It'll be fine. I'll be right there with you. Everyone's used to seeing the newer people change. No one will think it unexpected."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll be right back. I should wear more than this..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">""I don't know, the pillows are quite fetching."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right. Uh, could you close your eyes?" Kali waited until he did then dashed for the stairs. She returned shortly dressed in one of her flight suits. "Ok, guess I'm as ready as I will ever be."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">They made their way to the Adam and Eve in companionable silence. Kali had her nerves under control until Bart pulled open the door and waved her in first. Then it hit her again as she saw the crowds in the pub. Bart's calming whisper helped a bit, "Remember, everyone here has gone through this themselves." That got her back to where she could walk calmly to the Temple Heath table. "Hey everyone, we're here." Bart announced. "I have an important announcement. Our very own Kali," he bowed briefly to her, "was with Sammi and Jemima on the daring rescue at Delestra 6 earlier today. I think she deserves a round of applause. She proves once again that we aren't just a bunch of tech nerds." Applause and appreciative laughter echoed around the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Face burning, Kali dropped into an empty chair and tried to simultaneously slip under the table and cold stare Bart to death. "Um, it was nothing." She mumbled as she tried to slip away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart gently held her in place. "Oh no you don't. You did a good thing today, something no one is expected to do, especially a new arrival. Live it up. Enjoy your moment in the lime light and tell us about your first trip." He continued in a quiet whisper, "There is comfort in the sharing of it. Think of this as your first step out of the shadows."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't really do much, other than not get in the way..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not get in the way? We would have died if it hadn't been for the three of you. Don't let her fool you, she leapt into the fray like an avenging angel and single-handedly took out half the demon forces." Kali stared at the speaker recognizing him as one of the team huddled on the platform. He was about to continue when he glanced up and saw her white and strained face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In a tight voice she said, "It wasn't me. I wasn't in control. My gun jammed and I was terrified when they came at me. I lost it. I couldn't have stopped even if I'd wanted to." Her voice rose in pitch and volume as she leapt to her feet almost shouting, "Don't you understand? I COULDN'T have stopped..." suddenly she realized she was shouting and stopped, collapsing into her seat with her face in her hands.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Stunned silence endured for several moments until Bart asked, "So, what are you drinking Kali?" Then conversations started up again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just as her nerves were calming down a voice called from across the table, "Way to go Erick, embarrass her some more why don't you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Erick had the grace to blush as he leaned close and said quietly, "We all fear things about ourselves. You may even let it cripple you, if you must, but know this - I would stand by your side against the evil anytime and anywhere. I refuse to fear you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Not looking up from the table she mumbled, "Murphy’s Imperial Stout, please." She intended to sip one for a little bit and then quietly slip away, but soon the tales of Void trips were flying around the table. Slowly she was pulled out of her mortified silence and gradually drawn into the tales being told around the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was as startled as everyone else when Bart’s voice cut across the crowd again. "Merris. Merris, over here. Decided to come down from the mountains and join the rest of us for a bit?" Kali glanced up then looked again. Nerves had kept her from really looking at Merris in dispatch. She was dressed in a black leather jacket that looked like it had seen a few too many years. Underneath she was wearing a dark blue top. Worn black jeans and scuffed work boots completed the outfit. Her hair was still tousled and as Kali watched she reached up and ran a nervous hand through it before easing her way toward the table. As she drew closer Kali saw care lines worn into her face and realized she wasn't as young as she had appeared.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Everyone shifted again to crowd one more chair in around the table. Merris ended up wedged between Kali and Erick. "Erick, didn't expect to see you here. I thought you'd be taking a well deserved rest."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well, what better way to celebrate surviving than drinking with my mates? Besides I wanted to thank the lady to your right for saving my ass today. Heard tell she was hanging with this bunch of clowns when I got back, so here I am."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The tales resumed again where they had left off. Pints were refilled again and again as the evening wore on. The tales turned to ones of embarrassment and troubles. Each person around the table had at least one trip where they screwed up badly and it was only through luck or help that the mission was saved. When her turn came Kali launched right into her adventures, telling all that happened. She found herself feeling curiously better afterward, like it had provided a catharsis for her soul somehow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For the first time she started to relax, and as she did, exhaustion stole over her. After her third yawn in as many minutes she rose and announced, "I think I should be going, I want to be functional at the yards tomorrow and it’s been a really long day," She stood to go, only then feeling the number of pints she'd had. Every time her glass had neared empty another one had appeared. She couldn't remember how many she'd actually had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris stood up and steadied her. "Hey, someone tell Big Joe I took Kali home." She turned to Kali and added, "He doesn't like anyone staggering home alone, says it’s hard on repeat business." She followed Kali’s lead as they reached the street, then hesitated a moment at the door to her building. "Don't remember this one, what floor you on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Top, but I'm ok from here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh no you don't. I'm supposed to see you home, and that’s what I'm going to do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But, what about you? If you see me home, then you'll be staggering home alone," Kali returned with a grin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just drop me on a floor somewhere, I'll be fine. I don't have to be back to dispatch for the next couple of days, so I can head out when I wake up." Slowly they worked their way up the stairs, stopping for extended rests at each landing. "So, anybody else share this building with you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I haven't seen anybody, but there are four floors they could be on. And there are several people in the alley behind here. What’s the what with that? Is there a housing shortage here? I thought this place provided what everyone needed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It does, but if some of your worst memories are about things that were done to you in buildings, maybe the street seems a better place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn. Guess I didn't think of that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone finds the place they need to feel safe here." She paused and looked thoughtful before continuing, "For example I have bad memories from my bedroom, so I like places that don't remind me of it. Places like the couch in dispatch."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The couch in dispatch?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah - there's this green leather couch that I sleep on. Since I'm a workaholic anyway it saves a lot of time. Sure, I have an assigned room where I can wash up and change, but I can usually be found in Portal Station Dispatch."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They finished the climb to Kali’s rooms in silence. Kali took Merris on a quick tour, quick slamming two pints of water while in the kitchen, then pointed her to the pillows in the lounging area. "Do you need to see me to bed, or is home close enough?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I should verify your safety to fully complete my mission. I wanted to tell you, I like the new look. Are you doing ok with the change? It can be really unnerving at first."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, no, I'm not sure. Everything's so sudden and new here, I think I'm mostly still in shock and denial," Kali replied. "Well, if you have to verify, it's this way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Grinning, she followed Kali up the stairs to the bedroom and gave it a quick survey. "Not bad for a bedroom. Great view!" She exclaimed as she turned and spotted the cathedral through the windows. With a grand flourish she pronounced, "I declare you safely home." She fled back down the stairs to the pillows as Kali collapsed on the bed.</p>
