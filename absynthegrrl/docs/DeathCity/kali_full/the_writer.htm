<p class="pagecaption">Me, A gift of the Insides</p>
<p class="regtxt5">First - the obligatory disclaimers. I have a very hard time expressing any of this in conversation. Several times I have started, only to lock up at the actual thought and then veer rapidly away. This is intended to explain some of the gaps and other skipped bits. It might also explain why I feel crazy... It might also read as very dry since it is really hard to say even in writing...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With that out of the way - on with the show. The first bits are early childhood and likely not in actual order since it is all a jumble anyway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An early one - I remember carrying something heavy, for a preschooler anyway, around the house. I had already been going to the indoctrination center, read church. So, feeling full of myself as all children do I made some statement of "look, I'm as strong as Jesus". Talk about immediate and supreme beat-down from the pparents. It's as if I had claimed to be him or something.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Preschool, kindergarten, what-ever - the standard human situation, enter bullies and other reprobates - parental reaction - a standard refrain - grow a tougher skin. Granted, in retrospect, some valuable advice - still didn't stop the progression of beginning to find most people vile, disgusting, and stupid.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I am sure that somewhere in here was when the "don't do____(fill in the blank) it could be dangerous and you could get hurt" began. In their defence they didn't want their children hurt, and I don't think they foresaw any of the negative impacts until much later. Plus it kept us closer to them when moving through strange places, so they didn't have to worry about us running off, getting lost, or overly annoying anyone nearby.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was also a rather gullable child. I had a friend who said he had a rocket hidden in his basement. In the way of all good story-tellers he never showed any of us this wonderful item, just mentioned it now and again. Thus I had my first concious case of wanting to believe something because it made the world more interesting and added possibilities. It seemed better to believe him than to have to admit the world was mostly the view my parents painted of obligations to society, church, etc. A rather joyless and empty sort of existance from the way they always seemed to be sad and worn down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When I was a bit older I was over at my best friend's and we were in his room when his little sister came in. She called us "weiner glasses" after the odd arrangements of male hardware. I think that was the first real indication of why my body didn't seem configured right. Up until then it was just a feeling of discomfort, like the configuration was somehow "not right". Without any sisters to compare to and with my parents already really weird about anything physical I had no idea how "boys" and "girls" were different. Sometimes in those early times I would look at my form and want to take large knives to it. Just start chopping and changing until it would maybe look "better". I never actually did, but the temptation was certainly there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This was also the time when playing house would happen with my total aversion to either role. I still have no idea what weird mix of chemistry, evironment, and the like made me so vehemently opposed to the whole family order thing - although it might have been the total percieved inability of my own parents to deal with what I would ask or encounter. I suspect that when my little brother came along he didn't fare much better in the parent support catagory. I just knew I didn't want to be the mommy or the daddy. I wanted to be the mad scientist in the castle on the hill. Left alone, without the need to play the parts, fit the molds, be a "contributing member of society".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">To cope in high school. It is still almost impossible to set this down...ah well</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I told you about the prank in junior high, where a couple of us convinced a classmate we were probe robots from an alien race. In high school the chariots of the gods craze hit. The thought we were influenced by alien races and the like. In the already dissatisfied and alienated way that really resonated with me. And thus the survival delusion was under way. What if I were some type of descendent of a crashed group of outsiders? It certainly would explain the feelings of disconnection and otherness. So I ran with it. Soon there were half a dozen of us that shared the same delusion. It was glorious in some ways.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We detailed what we thought it might have been like, our "past world". Some of the ideas we had became the basis of the original gaming world - soI've gotten something out of it any way. It was a very detailed thing. We suspected where we had hidden ships, how we had arrived, a couple of ideas of when and where, and we were always scanning the archeological findings to see if there was any tangible evidence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The problem was when it ended later in life. How could the mundane bullshit of american life compare with the chance to return to another planet and restart a civilization? When the dream crashed I didn't find anything worthy of replacing it. It is why I really don't care what I do here. None of it has any strong meaning to me. It's all going through the motions of survival in a world I still don't feel any belonging to.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It is also why the gender issues didn't make as much of a concious pull. Sure, I was different, but it was because of this other thing. I didn't like either gender role I saw growing up, but that was ok, because it wasn't my damn planet anyway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Death City <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/kali.htm">Kali</a> is who I would have liked to have been. Although I am probably a bit closer to her than I think. The <a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/the_author.htm">Mystery Woman</a> is more what I tend to feel like.</p>
