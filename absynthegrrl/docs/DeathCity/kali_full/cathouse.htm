<p class="pagecaption">At the Devil's Cathouse</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Throbbing dark rhythms met them as they walked back into the Cathouse. Kali dashed down the stairs, threw her bags toward the bar, and launched into motion. She didn't notice the lights were up, only the music mattered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On stage Ennui smiled broadly and motioned to the rest of the band. Instantly the music stopped. "That seems good. Maybe we should go over the opening once more. Claire, you ready on lights?" When the stage lights bumped quickly the lead guitarist set her instrument in a stand and climbed on the gurney at the back of the stage. Ennui, and two others walked back to it and pushed it to the center of the stage. Ennui crossed to her bass while the others moved to drums and keyboards. The drummer smashed a mallet into a huge gong. The lights flashed once. The drummer slammed the gong again and the lights flashed once again. The drummer began a slow heartbeat rhythm and the keys came in with a low, haunting melody. Kali began mouthing words, without even noticing, as she danced. The gong crashed again. Suddenly the keys gave forth a shriek and the figure on the bed twitched. Kali raised her arms aloft and screamed, "Life, give my lover life!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The band faltered for a moment and Kali dropped her arms as she realized she had spoken. "Kali, what did you say?" Ennui called from the stage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, nothing, I'm sorry."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really, we'd like to know. It sounded like it would fit the music. Please."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, I really don't remember. I was dancing and then I heard someone shouting, then you called to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Claire, would you get Kali a headset. Kali, would you let Claire record what you say?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd rather not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You won't have to listen to it. It would let us hear what you said." Claire held up a headset microphone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, ok, but I probably won't even remember what I said before. And remember, you promised, I don't have to listen to it, ever!" Kali reluctantly agreed as she took the offered mic. She slipped it on and waited for the opening to begin again. This time through the band didn't stop when Kali shouted. They kept going to the end of the first number.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui motioned for playback and stood listening to Kali's track. "Wow, listen to this, this is perfect! Claire, send it to the rest of the band, ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali jerked rigid as her voice sounded in her ears. She opened her mouth to scream, then closed it as she listened to a low alto voice with dark over tones and a hint of an eastern European accent. Her words were haunting and powerful, telling of a dead lover and a desire to bring her back to life.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, that's great! May we use it? It so fits the idea for the opening. Bella, you could add some more haunting keyboard and we could sing over it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think Kali should sing it. It needs a darker voice," Claire said through the headphones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think Kali should sing it," Kali replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should, and you should dance with the band, at least for the first night back. It would so totally rock the house and be a great way for the band to come back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come back? What do you mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The rescue where we met? We lost one of the band on that mission. When we next play it will be the first time since then," Ennui answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know. Claire, I'm no performer, I don't think I could do it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure you could. With the headset mic you could be anywhere, even in with the rest of the dancers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Although, it would be really cool to have you up on stage with us," Ennui countered. "I remember several bands in the realms that had stage dancers. You certainly have the moves."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no, I think I like Claire's idea better," Kali replied, face burning. "I'm not a performance dancer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bullshit," the drummer countered. "You're as good as the best I've seen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, this is Audrey, stage-name Nightshade," Ennui introduced the drummer. "And this is Beth, stage-name Belladonna, our keyboardist, and Maggie, stage-name Nausea, our lead guitarist and the other vocalist."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should at least give it a try. Rehearse with us a few times and see how it feels. I think you'd be great!" Maggie added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And people are watching you on the dance floor anyway. Remember the dance shop clerk," Dementia called from the bar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The itching burn of energy began to crawl along Kali's nerves again. "Ok, I'll practice a bit, just let's get started again." Ennui flashed her a questioning look. At Kali's nod she motioned to begin. They ran through the opening several times, each time Kali was a little less tentative with her vocals.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After the fourth run-through Kali said, "This seems good, but we could make it a lot more theatrical."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Image we start with a dark stage and a single spotlight on the back entry. A doctor looking character pushes a table into the center of the stage, followed by the usual hunchback assistant. The doctor begins a pantomime of stitching together a body from various parts. Once in a while asking the assistant for another body or a part. This is where my current vocals go, as well as some nice haunting, creepy keyboards. At the end of it the doctor and assistant attach the table to a lift and haul it up to the roof. There the fake body gets switched with Maggie and we use the lightning and thunder effects. Once the table is lowered, Maggie rises and you launch into the second half of the lyrics, something about a dead girl living again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hmm, might work," Maggie commented. "Although we'd have to get mods made to the club."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not a problem," Dementia called from the bar. "The back sections are above here, shouldn't take much to pull more floor and the lift we can get from the sorting center. Probably be done middle of next week. You still planning for next friday as your new debut?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think so. Kali, can you have the rest of the lyrics by early next week?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rest of what lyrics?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"To Dead Girl Living of course. It's your concept, it should be your song."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute, I'm not even a musician."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are now, unless you want out. You should give it a try though. Just think poetry to music, that helps me," Beth replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, right. Could you guys play some more? I really ne, want to dance some more." Kali headed for the stairs down from the stage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where are you going?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Back to the dance floor, unless you are running the opening again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If your going to be the stage dancer you should get used to the stage."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, right, ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several hours later Dementia called, "Club opens in an hour. You might want to pack it up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once the gear was moved off the stage Kali headed to the bar to pick up her clothes. "Kali, you want to stay for dinner? It'll be bar food but I expect you'd be coming back anyway, so this will be easier." Dementia offered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"True. I'll stay, thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali finally staggered home long after midnight. She reached for the doorknob and only vaguely registered the note taped to it. Half way up the stairs it registered enough for her to go back and read it. "Kali, I stopped by to see how you are doing. No one has seen you today and I was wondering. I'm going to wait a while in case you come in late. I'm on the pillows in the living area. If I'm asleep, see you in the morning, I hope. Danny."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali slipped into the living area and looked down. Danny was curled up in the pillows, peaceful in sleep. Kali smiled, grabbed a spare blanket from her room and draped it over him. He stirred in his sleep, pulled it up under his chin, and settled back down. Upstairs Kali fell into bed and slipped into sleep.</p>
<br/>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali woke cross-wise on the bed with vague memories of tormented sleep. "Still not sleeping?" Danny asked as she stumbled down the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not very well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you doing ok otherwise?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, why do you ask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You weren't around yesterday and Anastasia was fairly certain she'd freaked you out the day before. She said you left looking really strange, either very angry or very hurt, she wasn't sure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't really anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Look, this is all just so new, the fighting, the healing, the magic, trains to different worlds. It catches up to me sometimes, just how much everything changed in the last couple of weeks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"About that healing," Kali pointed at her legs. "Damn, these look like you've had them a week or more. Guess that answers your question. Is there any pain, swelling, or discoloration on any of the others?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali shook her head. "No. You know another thing I love about this place? I can go to the Cathouse, stay until I'm almost deaf, and my ears are fully healed by morning. And the best thing of all, I can breathe clearly on a daily basis."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean about the breathing? Were you asthmatic before?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I might have been. Most mornings I would end up in at least one major coughing fit. Cold weather, car exhaust, most perfumes and cleaning products would prompt the same reactions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds asthmatic to me. Glad that's gone for you as well. So, you want food? I'm cooking again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't have to cook this time. I didn't think I had any food after the last time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You didn't. I went to the market on my way over last night, and it's no problem, I like to cook. Let me treat you again. That way I can be sure you're eating enough."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm eating fine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You do realize you aren't sleeping well and are dancing and exercising more than most."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't want to start eating too much and get fat like I was in the realms."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you don't get enough food your body will start to eat itself and it will effect your dancing. I'd appreciate it if you kept track of your weight for a while, until you know you are eating enough."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, ok. I am a little bit hungry," Kali sat and watched Danny for a few minutes before finally asking, "Why all this interest in me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I consider you a friend and I take care of my friends." He set a large section of cheese, mushroom, and sausage omelet in front of her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We don't even know each other."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've seen you naked, fixed you up, and helped you home. That should count for something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess," she responded slowly. "But lots of people have seen me almost naked of late."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's true. Doesn't stop me from wanting you for a friend."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you say so," Kali launched into her food.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would you mind if I asked you something?" Danny asked a few minutes later.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If I do, I won't answer," Kali smiled to take the sting from the words.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've always wanted to ask women why they shave their pubes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, let's get personal, but I'll answer it if you answer why do men shave their faces?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny laughed, "Ok, I shave because my beard comes in ragged and itches like a mad fiend. Shaving is just easier."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fair enough. I shave because I like the look. Although," Kali's eyes danced with mischief in her bright red face, "I'm thinking it looks a little plain down there. Maybe I should spice it up with piercings or tattoos."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She openly grinned at Danny's wince. "Ouch! It looks very fine down there, really."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you are a connoisseur? How many have you seen?" She shot back, trying to ignore the surge of interest her body felt at his admiration.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny blushed bright red, "Enough. I am a medical professional after all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And how do I stack up?" Panic flickered across her face as she realized she actually asked what she was thinking. "Oh gods, I didn't just ask that, forget I asked that. Don't answer that!" She leapt up and dashed from the room. Up stairs she threw on a boiler suit and boots. Her face was still bright red as she hurried for the door out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are beautiful," Danny murmured under his breath as he sat back, trying to sort through the strange signals Kali had been sending. "You are one strange woman, Kali," he thought while starting on the dishes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nervous energy kept Kali moving at an almost run to Temple Heath. Once there she spent twenty minutes in the yard trying to dance off enough of it to concentrate on the day ahead. She grabbed the plans for the servo system she had tried to work on previously and headed out to try again. The conversation with Danny kept popping into her thoughts the instant her attention wandered. Over and over she analysed it, but couldn't figure out why she had asked that last question.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After a fruitless hour she stalked into the shop, threw the plans on her bench, and found Bart. "I'm sorry, I won't be able to work on that servo today either." She pushed shaking hands through her hair and tried to find something else to say. Energy boiled off her in waves, making Bart start to shift in sympathetic nervousness. "I'm headed to Goth City. You need anything taken up or brought back?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, thanks for asking. Are you ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah." Her look discouraged any more questions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, see you later then."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She ran for the station, arriving out of breath and almost calm. She hurried through the main concourse and hunted around through the cavernous building until she found the information kiosk. Seated inside was a librarian looking woman leaning back with a large book propped up on her lap. "Fred?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes?" She looked up from a large book. "Do I know you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Anastasia told me to come find you. I was wanting to know about any train scheduled to the area near Eternal Metal Works. I'm Kali by the way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali? The Kali? I expected you to look larger somehow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, the Kali of extraction team fame. I expected you to be more fearsome or something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali rolled her eyes. "Guilty as charged. Although I don't feel very fearsome."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Riiight. Not the way I've heard it told. Anyway," Fred looked down and typed a few keys. "I show a small freight leaving in ten minutes from platform 5. If you hurry you can make it." She hit a few more keys. "Give the driver this cab permit and you can ride the jump seat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked, thanks! Uh, which way?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fred pointed down the massive entry hall and to the left. Kali dashed off in the indicated direction. She slid to a brief stop when she saw the sign for platform 5. She arrived beside the locomotive just as the driver was finishing a walk around. "Hi."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hi. Kali isn't it? I thought you'd be, you know, larger, more muscular, somehow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do you know me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How many curly red haired women have you seen wearing a boiler suit wandering around Death City? I figured it was a good guess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, guess so. Fred gave me this cab permit. I'm trying to get to Eternal Metal Works."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No trouble, come with me. I've got some stuff to drop there." He smiled and waved her into the cab. "Take the jump seat over there. I'm Alex." He concentrated for a few minutes getting the train cleared and in motion. "It's about fifteen minutes to the Goth City switches, then another ten to the metal works. I'm afraid I'm not really the talkative sort. Hope you don't get too bored."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm good. Got a lot on my mind anyway." Kali settled back and tried not to let her mind drift toward Danny and the morning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Guess extractions might do that to a person. You've got a lot more courage than I do. I admire that." Kali's eyes popped open. "I don't think I could go out on one of those. How do you do it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe I'm an excitement junky. I don't know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Seems pretty heroic to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stared at him from eyes gone cold and hard. "Look, I'm no hero. I'm just a screwed up girl trying to figure out who she is. Don't try to make me something I'm not." She turned and stared out the window.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A hero is someone who is in the wrong place at the wrong time and makes the best choices to get people back from it. I didn't mean to upset you. Others see you very differently than you see yourself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, and they'd be wrong."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would they be? I wonder," Alex watched as she stared stiffly out the window. "Maybe you're the one who's wrong. Or, maybe, in the end, it doesn't matter at all who is right or wrong, just that you were there." The rest of the trip passed in silence as his words seeped into Kali's thoughts.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty minutes later they pulled between two towering brick buildings and into a large switch yard sourrounded by more large brick buildings. Dust grimed windows and sagging, closed doors marked many of them. Only three had open doors, lights, and sounds of activity. Alex motioned to the center building. "Come on, I'll introduce you to Ron." He swung down from the cab and started toward the doors. Kali hurried to follow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside sounds of hammering, the hiss of welders, and the smell of hot metal washed over her. Alex turned to the nearest person and asked, "Ron around?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In the office."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alex turned left and started up a steep stairway. It wound around the inside of the building to a set of rooms overlooking the main floor. "Ron, this is Kali."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, welcome. Bart told me to expect you. What can we do for you?" Sparkling devilish green eyes glinted in a roundish, sun burned face. What hair he had left was bone white.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I need some sheet steel cut and bent. Bart recommended your team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can do that. Alex, you here with the steel?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yup. If we could get that unloaded I'll be on my way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Terry can get you set. He's back with the milling machines right now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Great Ron. See you around, Kali."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks for everything," Kali added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm going to introduce you to Rainy. She handles model making and fabrication planning. She'll get you what you need." Ron rose and led the way back downstairs. He crossed the main floor and entered a smaller section of benches, wood and clay working tools, and partially finished models of odd mechanical pieces. "Rainy, you back here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey boss," A head of bright red hair poked out of a side room, followed by a black clad woman. "What's up?" She was just a bit shorter than Kali and solid, muscular, with a round face and a warm smile. "Kali, isn't it? I love your tattoo! Did you design it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hi. Did we meet? I'm afraid I don't remember."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A couple of days ago, on Farlirish. I was in that cluster of people you dodged through. What do you need?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was hoping to get forearm and shin guards bent out of some sheet steel. Bart sent me over here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good choice on his part. Anything you needed boss? Otherwise I can get Kali's project done in a couple of hours." Ron shook his head and headed back for the office. "We can do that. What did you have in mind?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was thinking eighth inch sheet metal curved to fit around and held on with some type of velcro straps."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's possible, however, anything solid enough to be effective will be heavy. From what I've heard of how you fight, it might hurt more than help. And it would be something that could get grabbed or hooked with claws. Here, let me show you," Rainy pulled Kali into one of the back storage areas and over to a bin of smaller pieces of metal. She grabbed one and put it in Kali's hand. "This is about the size you would need."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali lifted it, moved it in the motions she would use, then handed it back. "It seemed like a good idea, but it would be too heavy. Sorry to have bothered you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No bother at all. Would you pass on my thanks to the rest of you team for saving our asses? I didn't get a chance to talk to Anastasia."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. Guess I should find a train back. Where would I find a station?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're not very busy. I can show you, on one condition."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tell me about the real Kali. The legend is already confusing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Legend? What the fuck?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several heads came up at Kali's outburst. Then someone pointed and Kali just heard, "That's her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come on, the sub-train connection is in the office building. We can talk along the way." Rainy practically dragged Kali out of the building. "Look, more and more people are afraid to go out because of the interference by the proxy gods and their minions. At first it was just a minor darkling or two trying a few scare tactics. Now real damage is being done to people and equipment. And with the death of Le Mort, the killings have started as well. You're the first one to stand up and kick ass. Anastasia and her people are good defenders, but it will take more than that to keep us safe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But Sammi and Jemima..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I know they've helped too, but we see you around here. No one knows where they are or what they are doing. They blow in to Eternia, and blow back out again. You are more accessible and visible, thus you become the legend." Kali started pacing back and forth across the hallway, not noticing the people starting to trickle in. "Kali, unless you want to talk to a lot of people, we really need to go," Rainy said when she noticed the others gathering. Kali stumbled to a halt and fear flickered briefly on her face before she drew herself up. Rainy grabbed her hand and dragged her down a stairwell. "We're in luck, a train is just arriving." They hurried on as soon as the doors opened. Within moments the train was in motion again. "This will take us to city center where there's a station, the busiest one in the city. It shouldn't take long to get a train back to Death City."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe I shouldn't have run."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you want to talk to them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, but maybe I could have stopped this legend crap. Now they have even more to feed on." Kali slumped back in her seat and stared out at the tunnel slipping by.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"People need larger than life figures. It's something to aspire to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aspire to? What a laugh. I'm nothing to aspire to. What does it take to make them realize that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This isn't about your wants, it's about their needs."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And what about my clay feet? What happens to their needs then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't mean to be cold about this, but did anyone ever worry about you when you discovered the clay feet of one of your heroes? The same applies. That is for them to deal with."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It just seems so weird," Kali commented as she returned to staring out the window.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You were one of the invisible people in the Realms, weren't you? Best you can do is try and roll with it. Be who you are to the best of your abilities. Let the others deal with their own issues. You'll go crazy otherwise. Now, you never did answer my question on your tattoo."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Tattoo? Oh, right, I sort of designed it. I found the black work with the labrys and triangle on a temporary tattoo and had the artist help me add the snow leopard to the top." Kali turned back from the window to answer. "I'm sort of toying with the thought of getting either a piercing or another tattoo. Do you have anyone you'd recommend, or know anyone that could recommend a good artist or studio?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I haven't had any done myself, but most everyone at the Dans Macabre speaks highly of Death's Head Tattoo. It's just upstairs from Dans and in the main floor of where I live. What were you thinking of getting done?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not sure yet. Still considering, but I've wanted more tats and a piercing or two for a while. Dans Macabre?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Our local version of the Devil's Cathouse. It's a goth club in Death City."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I've heard of the Cathouse."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should check Dans out some time." The subway slowed to a stop at a brightly lit platform. "Well, this is the tube station for City Central Station. Upstairs they can get you on a train back to Death City." Kali stood and headed for the open doors. At the last minute Rainy joined her, "I can always catch another train back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can find my way back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know that. I'm just enjoying talking to you and I'm not ready to end that." They walked up the wide flight of stairs and into a cavernous hall. Their footsteps echoed in the allmost empty expanse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would have expected crowds."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The city is huge but there aren't that many of us living in it right now. None of us knows why there is so much empty space, but it is weirdly enjoyable. You have some time to stay? I can show you some of the interesting parts."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, I don't know. Adaptation reaction won't let me stay still for long and it's starting to build up again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could take you to Dans and you could burn off some energy dancing, if that's something you do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, it's something I do." Kali followed Rainy as she headed for the main doors of the building. Outside she turned right down a wide cobbled street. They walked several long blocks between tall buildings. Kali expected something like New York but the architecture was weirder with more carvings, odd angles, and strange lines. Rainy turned left, crossed the street and started down another one. Five blocks ahead sunlight filtered in from a large clearing to the left. "Up ahead is the inner city park. It's about a kilometer wide and three kilometers long." A block before she turned right and pointed, "I live behind the cathedral, in that shorter brick building. Dans is in the basement, off an alley that runs from the cathedral back lot to the far street. Death's Head Tattoo is on the main floor, next to a small deli." She walked slowly along an overgrown path past the cathedral, giving Kali plenty of time to take in the massive stone structure. "I have a killer view from my flat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No one maintains the cathedral?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, from the condition of the surroundings I'd guess not really. Religion has always creeped me out, so I haven't tried to go inside. You can, if you want."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe another day."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rainy continued up the path, around the back of the cathedral, and to a narrow alley behind the centerline. She turned down the alley and walked about half way down it. Muted bass rythms drifted up a narrow stair, descending to a metal door. Red neon painted dancing letters in red flame on the wall above, spelling out, "Dans Macabre". Rainy opened the door and motioned Kali into the dark interior. Small clusters of people danced to the pounding music. A few more sat at the small tables around the edges or at the bar. "It fills up as night falls." Kali smiled and launched herself onto the floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An hour later she slipped into a chair by Rainy. "Thanks. This helped quite a bit. I should think about heading back soon. Was there anything else you wanted to show me this time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The cathedral view, if you'd like," Kali nodded and Rainy led the way back out of the club. "Stairs or elevators?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stairs, I can use the exercise."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Rainy cocked an eyebrow at Kali and returned to the area behind the cathedral. Along the wall of her building she started up a fire escape ladder. She climbed the steps to the last platform before the roof, ten floors up. She walked to the right end of the platform, where it ended in a windowed turret on the corner of the building. She opened the window facing the fire escape and climbed in. "There's inside stairs at the front of the building, near the elevators, but the view back here is so much better." Inside was a large, open room with a drafting table. Drawings and notes scattered about it surface. A second table held modeling clay and tools. The next room held a large brass bed, huge teak wardrobe, small table covered with odd colored makeup, nail polishes, and jewelry, and a deep, plush chair. Next was a spacious bathroom, then the kitchen and eating nook and then a large front sitting room with a deep red velvet couch and several more plush chairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once Kali had seen the flat she gravitated back to the turret and the view of the cathedral. "That is a wicked view! How'd you find this place?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was walking around the cathedral and saw the building, went and hunted for the flat with the best view. Since then a few more have taken up residence. Looks like there's a storm coming in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lots of people have been thinking that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I meant the clouds over the park," Rainy pointed to the dark clouds in the distance, over the scrap of park visible past the cathedral.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, sorry. Just too much talk of the escalating dangers on the missions, I guess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'd hear that more, working in Bart's group."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You go out on many missions?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not too many and probably very few from now on. The last one really scared me. I'm very different from you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked away and shrugged. "I can't help it, really. I'm drawn to it like a moth to a flame, but I don't understand why."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't need to apologize. Everyone has different desires."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They stood and watched the clouds moving in and the sunlight on the cathedral for a while, until Kali said, "I really need to start back. I think I can find the station."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could walk back, or there's a subway station just down the block from the font doors of this building. Let me show you." Rainy led the way out through the front door and down the nicer stairway to the main entrance. She pointed out the tattoo shop, elevators, and deli that took up most of the first floor. "You want to talk to the tattoo people today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not yet. I need to think about what I really want first."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outside she turned left, walked to the end of the block, and descended a covered stairway. On the platform she pointed to a display board, "You want the number 7 headed toward city center. The first stop is City Central." She stepped a bit closer, Kali didn't hesitate to pull her into a brief hug. "I'll see you again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Count on it," Kali replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* more transition logic here? */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stepped off the train at Central Station and was walking across the main hall when she and Dementia spotted each other. "Kali, just back from somewhere?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The city up the line. What brings you to the station?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was headed to the recovery facilities for a lift and props for the Love's Bitch opening scene. You want to come along? You seemed to have a good idea of what it should look like and you could help me figure it out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Storm clouds continued to thicken and gather as the train looped around the city and into the recovery yards. Huge warehouses clustered around a group of sidings. Numerous trains were pulled up with people and machinery swarming nearby, moving crates and palets filled with items from the trains into the waiting buildings. Their train pulled up at a small siding where Dementia hurried off. She threaded her way through the activity and into the largest building. Inside, and to the right, a two level section of offices poked out from the rest of the building. Dementia led the way into one of the ones on the lower level. She stopped short when she saw only a single desk with a sandy haired man sitting at a terminal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dementia, may I help you?" He asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where is everyone, Terry? Who's recording all the incoming items?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You haven't been here in a while, have you? A new recruit came in about three months back and convinced us to try bar coding everything. Now we scan the items as they come off the trains and enter the data using portable terminals. It has really sped things up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about all the people that used to log items?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right now they're out coding all the previous stuff and checking the results of the new system against the old. Some will move to the Hall of Records, some will remain to use the new logging tools, and some will move into sorting and return prep. Everyone is happy with the results so far. We've reduced the hassle factor and improved our ability to match items with destinations."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How would I find an item or two for the Cathouse?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can look it up for you if you know what you want, or you can wander the collections, just like always. What are you needing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A hoist or winch that we can rig to lift a metal platform with a gurney on it, some diamond plate or that metal waffle flooring like is used in outside stairs, and assorted pulleys and cable," Kali answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Best bet would be to take a look in building seven. There's a fair amount of that kind of stuff there. If you can't find what you need, Eternal Metal Works might be able to fabricate something. You know where to find building seven?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I do," Dementia replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here, take this scanning unit and wave it over the codes of any items you want. I'll get them packaged up and to the Cathouse early tomorrow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She led the way across the warehouse and out through a side door. The sky had darkened even more during the few minutes they had been inside. She followed a path around the back of the buildings until she came to one with a large seven stenciled over the door. Inside they prowled through stacks and shelves of industrial equipment and hardware. They found the winch, cable, pulleys, and fittings to rig the platform but not the platform itself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can go talk to someone at Eternal Metals about the platform tomorrow morning. I was just there today about a different project," Kali said as they walked back to the main warehouse. Dementia returned the scanning device and they headed back to the platform to wait for a train to Central Station.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It started to rain as Kali left Central Station for her apartment. At first it was just a slight spitting of drops, but it rapidly built to a steady downpour. At first she tried to dodge under any shelter but gave it up after the dampness seeped in anyway. By the time she reached her building she had slowed her pace and was tilting her head back to enjoy the rain streaming over her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once inside she hurried up the stairs to her apartment, slowing to a stop when she saw the flower arrangement sitting by her door. Yellow roses were framed by a selection of hybiscus, tiger lily, and bird of paradise blooms emerging from an ornate earthenware jug. An envelope was tied to one of the jug handles. She grabbed it, carried it up, and set it on the stairs to her bedroom. She shed her wet clothes and jumped into the shower to warm up, then took the flowers with her up to her room. She carefully untied the note and opened it once she had pulled on a floppy shirt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside was a note writen in neat hand writing. "Kali, I'm sorry for feaking you out this morning. That was never my intention. Please accept these as an apology for my rude behavior. And let me know if you want anything to help you sleep. Danny." She smiled as she set the note next to the flowers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She ate in, a simple meal of noodles, veggies and soup base. Then she headed off to the Cathouse to find Dementia. She found her behind the upstairs bar. "I was wondering if you could tell me where to find the knock out stuff you gave me a couple of nights ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's an apothecary next to the Goth Shop. He has it. Just ask for Dementia's Tea and he'll know exactly what you need. And he'd have those other items you should have as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, yes, thanks," Kali said, her face turning red.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<br/>
<!--  need to decide whether to include this - is it too much, and is it needed -->
<p class="regtxt5">/* talking to Ennui at some time soon */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The thing to really think about is sex doesn't require a relationship and relationships don't always include sex. You have a relationship with us, but we aren't having sex. Dementia and I have a relationship and we are having sex, before we got together I would sometimes have sex just for the fun of it, with the understanding it wouldn't lead to anything more involved. You just need to set your terms ahead of time so no one gets confused.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* first performance at the Cathouse with Kali dancing/singing - update where text doesn't match */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia walked out on the stage after the last set by DJ Death. "I know we had DJ Andros scheduled in for the last part of the night, however I have had a very special request. Our very own Love's Bitch has decided to return to the Devil's stage after a long absence. Please give them a proper Cathouse welcome."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked around in surprise at the hoots and calls from the crowd on the floor. Through the thunderous noise 3 women wheeled a sheet draped gurney onto the stage. Silently the one in a pink wife beater, black leather buckle sided pants and cat face makeup broke off and moved to a drum set. The second one, dressed in a white wedding gown with train, greyish face with suture lines and wild tangled dark blonde hair broke off and strode to a waiting rack of keyboards. Kali gave a start as she realized the third figure, dressed in a blood red crop top, spider web stockings, black velvet short dress, and a tuxedo coat with makeup similar to the keyboardist, was Ennui. Ennui set the wheel locks on the gurney and walked to a waiting bass guitar. A single spot flashed on the bed and dimmed to a soft glow as the drummer slammed a huge brass gong. A second flash of light and crash stabbed the figure on the bed as the drummer picked up a slow heartbeat rythm. The dim light began to pulse softly in time, growing a little brighter with each double drum beat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly the keyboards shreiked out a shuddering groan as the sheet draped figure lurched upright. As the sheet fell away the last figure rolled off the bed and half crawled to a waiting guitar stand. Slowly she stood, grey face and suture lines a fitting addition to the faded, torn, and stained pink dress she wore. She took a deep exagerated breath, and launched into a sizzling riff. The band erupted into the first heavy drum and guitar dance number of the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">this becomes their trademark opening. kali likes them well enough that she will go see them any time she can - the next bit takes place the first time Merris is at the Cathouse and sees Love's Bitch perform.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled in the shadows and watched Merris as she watch the now traditional opening of Love's Bitch. Merris watched enthralled as the light flashed and the heartbeat drum began. She was lost in a daze as the dance beat rose with the Bride. Kali spun into motion, pulling her along as the beat strengthened. Merris stumbled after her, not nearly as fluid but willing to give it her all. She loosened up rapidly and was feeling good about how she was doing until she saw Kali. She wound to a stop and stared like half the others on the floor. Once more Kali was lost in her own world, dancing intricate interpretations of the music she was hearing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris was lost in thought as well of a different kind. She heard violin melodies woven throughout the rifs and themes the band played. By the end of the evening Merris was strangely worked up. She was half pacing near the bar, talking jerkily to Kali about the preformance she had just seen. she wants desperately to add violin to their sound - this is the most pumped up Kali has seen her, granted Kali hasn't seen her that much</p>

<p class="regtxt5">she starts with lab coat, sally stitched face markings, and dr. para - sheds the coat to reveal the patchwork dress from nightmare before christmas with the sides slit high enough that she can dance without restriction - as she becomes more comfortable performing with the band she might strip out of that at some point during the night into even less - something light and easy to dance in that is non-restrictive and terrifying the first time she wears it out <look in goth clothing and Cruxshadows dancers - wishfire tour in particular> - heavy boots with buckles - think River-style from Firefly - when she moves to less she may have to mod the stuff she gets to stay in place when dancing - both to stay where desired and not fall apart under the stresses of the movement - look at Jool costume from Farscape - remove lower level of girdle and go more with a wide belt with gauzy veils front and back - narrow in the front, wider in the back, mid length, potential for tangling will set the final length - remove lower level of leather in halter and make sure it is fitted and lined to not chafe under movement</p>

<p class="regtxt5">opening performance:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">wolf howls behind a dark stage, once the theatre organ is online - the opening of Bach's Tocata and Fugue in D Minor will sound while the lights come up slowly to illuminate the Dr. stiding in, motioning her assistant to follow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">assistant goes to a large switch and turns on hot light over parked gurney - simulate operating room light</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali starts with assembling the new body from pieces as she softly sings her words to Merris haunting violin and maybe a bit of keys from Belladonna - she hoists the lift table up with Ennui acting as EyeGore - in a hunchback costume and weird mask - once the table is raised Nausea climbs on while the gong crashes and lightning flashes start - as Nightshade settles into a heartbeat EyeGore drops the table down with the softly pulsing light - Nausea will twitch her hand on the dance floor side - Belladonna wrings the shriek from her keys as Nausea sits up and rolls off the table - a second shreik as she stands, grabs her guitar, and launches into the first dance number - now it has words and is called Dead Girl Living - as the dance beat builds Kali flings off her lab coat and whirls into dance as Ennui ditches the hunchback costume, strips off the mask, and grabs her bass - the band is off into another night of hard hitting music</p>

<p class="regtxt5">beginnings of the scene:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Come EyeGore, we must be quick." the doctor admonished the ugly assitant pushing the gurney in behind her. the doctor glided to a table of instruments and pushed it to the gurney. cartoon medical instruments were used in various combos to work on the body on the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"EyeGore, more bodies!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the assitant waddled out and pushed in a wheelbaro with a body slumped in it. several saw strokes and the doctor held up another piece. as she stitched it onto the figure on the gurney haunting music built in the mix. she began to sing with it, softly at first, of her lover dead and of this last effort to bring her back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the stitching finished she secured four hanging chains to the table. "Raise the platform EyeGore," she commanded. the hunched figure scuttled to a huge wheel and tugged at it. slowly the table top rose to the ceiling high overhead. lightning flashed and the violin fell silent. "Life, "cried the doctor, "Give my lover Life!" she shreiked at the sky. lightning flashed again and again. in the background a heartbeat drum rythm began slowly and haltingly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">once she starts gaining confidence she will write Inner Child - about her inner child and the wreckage that surrounds her - which will open the second set</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Claire will tell everyone at Temple Heath about Kali and Love's Bitch. Bart will tell Merris */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your technique is good. Besides, technique gives you more moves and teaches you how not to hurt yourself. If you want to dance, you need to see the patterns in the music and dance those. Get out of your head, stop thinking about technique and moves, dance what you see, dance what you hear. You'll do fine!"</p>
