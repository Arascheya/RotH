<p class="regtxt5">Kali returned to consciousness in a spectacular hall. Sunlight and a warm breeze streamed in through windows of patterned metal, thick rugs cusioned her feet, and an enormous table was set before her with food and drink. She turned swiftly as a voice spoke from behind her, "I have used you, daughter. Yes, you accepted it with grace, dignity, and a willingness I had not expected. Even so, I used you, and cruelly too. Eternia is supposed to be a place of healing and rest, instead you faced nightmares far beyond what you saw in the Realms, and I owe you for it." Kali stood speachless as the Lady paced in front of her. "Is there something I might grant that would repay you? Perhaps return you to your friends, or to the Realms?" Kali shuddered at the thought of the Realms. "You would be as you are now. None would know you had come from a different background."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like to remain your avatar."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I cannot ask that of you, I would prefer not to do that to you, and it is far more cruel than you deserve. I would prefer to grant you peace and rest!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* more discussion - than maybe this result */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am so tired in this incarnation. My head knows my friends loved me, yet I can't feel it. I just want to rest, to forget, to take another turn in Eternia and see if, maybe, I can accept and feel less empty and cold."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can grant that. Rest here and slowly forget. When you are ready we will send you back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May I ask one thing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Daughter?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please let me remember how to dance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Done. You will always remain my daughter, even as you forget. Now picture a new you for your return and we shall let the resting begin."</p>
