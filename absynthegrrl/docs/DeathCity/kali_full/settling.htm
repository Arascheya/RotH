<p class="pagecaption">Settling In</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali awoke with the dawn, the water had once more prevented the hang-over, but she was less tired than she expected. Quietly she slipped downstairs and into the bathroom. Emerging, she bumped into a sleepy looking Merris, who was rubbing at her eyes. "Morning already?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, you can sleep more if you want. I'm headed over to Temple Heath, to look at the locomotive from yesterday. Bart promised he'd let me help. If you get hungry, you can have anything you find."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Still used to the Realms aren't you? Except for missions, schedules here are really flexible. If Bart gets there before you, he'll wait. I suspect you'll get there before him, even if you wait another hour or two. He was still going strong last night when we left."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I'll head out anyway. I'm awake and if I try and go back to sleep I'll just feel awful later. Hey, thanks for the escort last night. I'll see you later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks for the comfortable floor space. I'll have to escort you home next time I have too much at the Adam and Eve."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali emerged into the growing light of the day and headed toward Temple Heath. Her thoughts were bouncing and chaotic as she walked. It had felt good to walk home with Merris, yet she didn't know anything about her. It had been surprisingly pleasant to wake up to another person in the place. She hadn't realized she missed having a roommate that much. Laughing quietly at herself she shook off her thoughts and concentrated on looking at the city around her. She watched the shadows fall back before the sunlight, the glints off the river, and the sounds of waking going on around her. Slowly the city woke and activity started at a much less frantic pace than in Seattle. The few people she passed were happy and friendly, waving and calling out greetings to her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She walked confidently to the main shed and let herself into the cavernous building. Someone had moved the locomotive into one of the bays with an inspection pit and had removed many of the cowlings and covers to expose its inner workings. Breathing deeply of the diesel and oil laden air she walked slowly around looking at the locomotives in various stages of repair. Then she crossed to the office section and wandered into the large room that housed the drawings and documentation on the equipment the yards repaired. Finally she emerged through another door into the sunlit yards beyond. Lost in thought she wandered among the various pieces of rolling stock and locomotives parked on the sidings. She had just turned to return to the main shed when a run down building across the yard caught her notice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her curiosity drew her to it, as it had her apartment before. Slipping in through one of the partially open main doors she found herself in another cavernous building. Shafts of light streamed in through gaps between the planks of the walls and dust motes danced in the air where she had stepped. Smells of old oil, wood, metal, and smoke spoke of the age of the shed. Locomotives and odd rolling stock peered back at her from under layers of dust, rust, and disuse. A closer look showed many had been used as parts units at some time in their lives. She was about to head back when a lurking shape in the very back drew her attention.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She recognized the outline of a Baldwin M-4 class locomotive as she approached it. Even more curious she walked closer and could just make out the number 232 on the front of the engine. She could see rust everywhere and most of its paint had flaked away. Caked grease and dirt clung to the cylinders and wheels. Rust holes had eaten through parts of the cab. Carefully she approached and peered into the cab. More rust holes had eaten into the firewall and corrosion had frozen the valves. Saddened, she turned away and made her way back to the yards and the main shed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This time the place was alive with conversations and noises as the technicians started the day’s jobs. Bart met her at the office from the other side of the shed. "Did you get home ok? Sleep well? Ready to take a look at her today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I got home just fine, slept well, and I'm ready whenever you are." She glanced sideways at him, trying to judge the intent of his questions, but saw only his normally friendly look. She was about to ask him about Merris, but changed her mind and mentioned the Baldwin instead. "I arrived a bit early today and was snooping around."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing wrong with that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I came across the other shed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">His look turned sad. "Oh, the bone shed. A depressing place isn't it? That’s where we put the ones that are too far gone to repair. Once in a while someone will take one on as a special project, but most times they get used for spare parts. I wish we could fix them all, but there aren't enough of us, or enough time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I saw an old Baldwin locomotive in the far corner, number 232, I was wondering what her story was. I remember reading that she had been headed for the scrapping torch. How did this one come to be here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know much, really. A recovery team was at an old railroad repair facility just before it was scheduled for demolition. They'd been sent in to recover various parts for some of our existing engines. They found number 232 in one of the back sheds and managed to bring her along. I'm not sure what they were thinking, she was in bad shape even then. For a little while a couple of them had thought of fixing her up. It turned out we didn't have any information about her and they lost interest. No one else had time, so she found her way to the bone shed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The little bit I read on that class indicated that they were fast and powerful," She paused, then continued, "Well, anytime you're ready."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Today I thought we'd go over the loco. I'll show you the normal repairs and familiarize you with it. Tomorrow we can start on the traction motor wiring and the brake systems you cannibalized." They spent the rest of the day thoroughly checking over the locomotive. Bart explained what he normally checked at each step and pointed to examples of various problems. It was another intense day of work. They ended up replacing most of the fuel system and planned the wiring harness for the next day. Every so often Kali would find her thoughts returning to number 232. While they worked she asked questions about everything they were doing. By the end of the day her brain was packed full of new information and her body was exhausted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As she and Bart were leaving he turned and asked, "See you at the Adam and Eve for a drink later?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe. First I need a long bath and maybe some food, although I don't feel like preparing anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Big Joe sets a good table. Quite a few of us find it easier to just find a place to get food. If no one else has explained it, things you need are just provided. Big Joe loves to cook and run the Adam and Eve, it’s his contribution. Just like yours is the work you do here."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Later, soaked, scrubbed and dressed in clean things she prowled her kitchen. Nothing she had interested her. After one last look she headed to the Adam and Eve, figuring she could find something on the menu. As always the place was full. She was headed to the Temple Heath table when she spied Merris at the Vault bar. Threading her way over she slipped into the just emptied seat next to her. "Heya, come here often?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When I'm in town," Merris replied with a grin. "Best steak and kidney pie in Eternia."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really? I haven't had any since the Unicorn closed in Seattle several years ago." Kali turned to the bar just as Jo hurried up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, would you like anything with your Imperial tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How about a steak and kidney pie?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Done! Hey Merris, you want a refill on that india pale?" Kali just caught the thoughtful smile that crossed Merris face as she answered yes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few moments later Jo returned with Merris order and the pints. Kali watched with a grin as she dug in. "Good?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mmm hmm! Here, try a bite."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly Kali found a fork in her face, with a generous bite precariously balanced on it. Quickly she took it, before it could slide off onto her lap. Immediately tastes flooded her mouth. It was so far beyond what she had before that there was no comparison. "Wicked awesome! I can hardly wait for mine now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, Merris, are you two going to be anti-social all night, or are going to come join us?" Bart hollered from the Temple Heath tables.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Busted. We were, but we'll be right over anyway." Kali and Merris grabbed their things and made their way over to the crowded table. Chairs shuffled and shifted as they approached until enough room had been created for them to squeeze in. A moment later Jo arrived with Kali’s order. The conversation quickly returned to engineering and locomotive problems, leaving Merris a bit left out. She didn't seem to mind as she settled back and sipped her pint. Once in a while she would ask about a specific locomotive that had come back damaged, or that had been recovered from an aborted mission, but mostly she just listened.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All too soon it was way too late and the party started breaking up. This time Kali had been a lot more careful of how much she had. She stood with no problems and turned to go. Merris stood unsteadily a moment later, "I'll make sure you get home ok," she slowly said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a moment Kali thought of telling her she was ok, the reconsidered noticing how wiped out Merris looked. "Wicked, thanks!"</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The next morning Kali woke late to a dark, stormy sky. The smell of coffee and sounds of things rattling and banging drifted up the stairs. She staggered to the bathroom, threw cold water on her face and then made her way to the kitchen. There she found Merris busily engaged in producing breakfast. "I see you found the kitchen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It’s the least I could do for the use of your floor."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There were pillows, you could have used them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad you said that. Now I don't have to feel guilty for having already thought of that," Merris replied, grinning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're cheerful this morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That water thing you told me about before really does help. I'm doing fried potatoes and sausages, would you like anything else?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um, wow, no, that'll be fine. Thanks!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They ate in a companionable silence for a time before Merris commented, "Quite the place you have here. It looks like you've been here quite some time to get this comfortable."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not really. It was a lot like this when I found it. Although quite a bit more dusty." Merris stared intently for several moments, but Kali was too busy eating to notice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stop in at Portal Station next time you're headed out. I'll probably be catching a ride back later today. It’s hard for me to be away for long. There’s something about the Portal that calls to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will. I can't imagine not going out again. How do you get on a team?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are several ways. The easiest one is to show up at Central Station and let the platform people know you're available. That'll get you a one or two day mission. You can talk to them in advance and tell them what you'd like to go out on. Then they'll contact you a few days in advance. Lastly, you can tell me and I'll let you know when something you want is going. Did you have something specific in mind? Like long missions, or day only ones, anything like that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know yet. I've only experienced the one. I'm embarrassed to admit I really enjoyed the excitement of it though. I spent most of my time in the Realms trying to avoid conflicts and battles. Most of them seemed so stupid anyway. Things like ‘I don't like the way you dress, the way you look, the way you talk.’ They all seemed so pointless. There was something important, something valuable, about fighting for the lives of the other team. I think I want to be part of those kinds of missions."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I could certainly use another person for those missions. For the longest time there was a truce. Our teams weren't ever in danger of attack. About a year ago it changed. There aren't many people here who will do the kind of mission the three of you did. There are even fewer who will do a second one. Talk to Anastasia at Central Station if you are serious, she leads the main team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked! I can always withdraw later, if I change my mind?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, as long as you aren't in the middle of a mission. I don't think it would work if you stood up in the middle of a fire fight and said you were quitting." Merris smiled. "On a different topic, are you thinking of becoming a driver? You did really well with no training."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, I'm thinking about it anyway. There’s something magical about controlling that much hurtling metal. I've always liked mechanical things, they're easier to understand than people."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't cut yourself short. You do ok with people too." Merris countered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked away in embarrassment, then mumbled, "Gotta get going. See you again." Merris smiled warmly at Kali's retreating figure before turning to the breakfast dishes. She quickly finished them and took a few moments to wander through the flat in the daylight. Every so often something would catch her eye and she would stop for a moment or two for a closer look. She spent the most time in the study, carefully looking at the book titles on the shelf. There were plenty of software tutorials and references, a few electronics texts, a scattering of architectural treatises, and quite a few fantasy and science fiction novels.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Throughout the place there was little that said anything about Kali, other than she liked being comfortable. The furnishings were warm and inviting, without being cluttered, but there was precious little artwork. Only two pieces said anything about their owner. One was a warrior woman holding a labrys and glaring coldly out of the image, titled ‘If Looks Could Kill’. The second one was of a cat woman and a human woman cuddling on a driftwood log, near a fire. It was captioned, 'Out of the Water'. Looking closer she noticed there was an artist’s initials and a dedication of, "To Kali, in memory of a really awesome game, R."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finally she ended up back at the stairs to the bedroom. She started to climb, only to be assailed again by the unease that had followed her most of her adult life. Half way up the stairs she paused long enough to tell herself, 'This isn't even your place. This is not your bedroom.' After three deep breaths she was able to continue. The view drew her even before she had cleared the stairs. Almost in a trance she crossed to the windows and gazed out on the Cathedral of All Faiths. Reluctantly she finally turned away and completed her survey. 'You certainly are an enigma aren't you Kali? Why do I find you so fascinating, is it because you are such a mystery?' With a rueful shake of her head she gazed at the cathedral a few minutes longer, then headed downstairs and out into the threatening weather.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Spatterings of rain were beginning to fall as Kali arrived at the rail yards. Inside it was warm and cheery. Bart was already at work on the locomotive, pulling apart the clot of wires that had gotten it home. "You're smaller than I am. Why don't you get underneath and begin taking the cowlings off the wire-ways and truck motors. All these wires need to be replaced." They spent most of the morning opening up the wire ways and removing the damaged pieces.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali was pulling the last of the traction motor lines when one of the others came over, "Kali, Merris is on the comm for you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just a minute," she replied as she traced the wire in her hand to its end. She wrapped a cut off bit of wire around it so she could find it again and climbed out from under the loco. "OK, where do I find it?" He led her over to the office and to the handset sitting on the desk. "Kali."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey there! Just thought I'd let you know I made it back safely. How’s your day going?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bart and I are in the middle of the wiring harness for the engine. Things are going well. How’s it for you?" They chatted for a few minutes longer, then Kali made her way back to Bart.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everything ok? Is there an emergency?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Why?" Kali replied uncertainly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you do it? Usually Merris never calls unless there’s some type of problem she needs help with."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She just wanted to tell me she made it back alright." She looked up just in time to spot his grin, "What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing," Bart replied with a smile. "Now, where were we?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the day passed quickly as they traced out and checked the harness. Every so often Kali would find Bart grinning at her, especially when he thought she wasn't looking. Once in a while he'd have to prompt her when he would find her staring off into the distance. Near the end of the day he said, "You could go visit you know. Just hop a ride up to Portal Station tomorrow. This isn't the Realms, you don't need to show up every day for work. All I ask is you let me know when you won't be here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She doesn't call anyone, except for work?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, and she doesn't come down from Portal Station more than once or twice a year. When she does, it’s never for more than a day. You sure caught her attention."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once again she walked home with many things on her mind.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">She didn't go to Portal Station the next day. Instead she returned to Temple Heath, to finish up with the locomotive. Once again sleep came late and fled early, leaving her awake as the sun came up. Unable to sleep any more and with still too much on her mind she grabbed a cup of coffee and headed to the yards. Once there her steps turned to the bone shed. Carefully she climbed all over number 232, peering at linkages, valves, and tubes. She was trying to match her limited knowledge of steam engines with the reality of a complex locomotive. The big parts were easy. What confused her the most were the reverser system and the inlet and outlet valve controls on the drive cylinders.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart found her at the front of the engine, staring intently at the valve assembly. "I thought I might find you here. It looked like you might have been bitten by the steam bug. Let me show you a working one." He directed her outside and over to the main yards. There he showed her around a "Pacific type" 4-6-2 locomotive, built by American Locomotive, explaining the parts and systems. Finally he took her into the cab and explained the driving controls.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As they headed back to the main shed he slowed and commented, "I'm going to pry now. You can tell me to bugger off if I offend you too much. Are going to go to Portal Station sometime, or are you going to ignore what could happen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, no, I don't know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This, even more than the Realms, is an uncertain place. Don't throw away chances at connections, whatever they may be." They walked on in silence.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The day flew by as they rebuilt the traction motor and braking wiring.  Around mid day Kali was summoned to the comm again. She returned to find Bart studying the same junction panel he had been looking at when she left. He was fighting hard not to grin like an idiot as he made a great show of moving to the braking control system. Once he gained a bit of control he asked, "Everything ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alright, I give up, tomorrow I think I'll take a trip to Portal Station." Kali commented with a bit of a laugh. Bart’s grin widened even more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time evening came her decision had given way to a bad case of the nerves. She walked back to her place so wrapped up in thought that she didn't see the smiles and waves of the people she passed. Her feet took her past her building and on to the Adam and Eve before she even realized where she was going. Within moments she was at the bar, Murphy’s in hand, and a steak and kidney pie on the way. This time she spotted Bart before he saw her and made her way over to the communal table. The conversation and companionship kept her mind off her growing nervousness.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The next morning Kali stopped at the Adam and Eve briefly, then headed to Central Station and asked about passage to Portal Station. Twenty minutes later she joined the line of passengers on the platform and soon was aboard. Her seat was by a window looking out away from the platform. She settled back and waited for the trip to begin. The whistle blew, the train started to move and a stab of longing ripped through her. It grew and changed into frustration as the trip stretched on, longer and longer. Even thundering through the last tunnel didn't produce the mystical experience it had on her two other trips. It just felt like an eternity in the dark. Finally the train pulled into Portal Station. She stood quickly and, with borderline rudeness, pushed her way to the door as quickly as she could.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris stood in the shadows near the station doors, grinning for all she was worth. "Hey, I'm glad you came up," she said as she swept Kali into the hug she had been secretly hoping for. She stepped back and noticed the little storm cloud that seemed to be slowly dissipating above Kali’s head. "Was your trip ok? We didn't have any reports of trouble."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I guess so. It just felt strange to be stuck in the back with everyone. It’s so different when you're in the cab. Were you serious when you asked if I wanted to be a driver?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course I was. Why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd have thought everyone would choose to drive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A lot do at first, then they change their minds. Some when they think about the danger, you are, after all, the first person on the scene if anything goes wrong. But most of them stop when they think about being responsible for the locomotive, the rolling stock, themselves, and every person aboard. Few people here want that. All of us gravitate toward what we can handle. I don't like personal danger, but I love excitement and intensity, both of which I get a lot of in this job. Many people love danger, but don't want to have someone else pay if they screw up. What I'd recommend is go to Central Station and tell them you want to be a driver. They'll get you started with the training and then you can see if you really want to do it. Now let me show you my world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside the station Merris took her everywhere, showing her the common areas, then leading her through the support areas and offices. Then they went through the living areas, sections of the station where support personnel slept during their time there. It was much larger than it looked from the front, extending well back from the tracks. She saved dispatch for last and explained in intricate detail the computer monitoring and navigation systems that made it the hub of the Void part of the railroad. Local traffic control was a joint effort between Portal Station and the control center in Death City. Then, with a grin, she pointed at an old dark green leather covered couch, crouching in a far corner. Its covering was old and worn and a faded blanket covered the back. A large monitor hung above it, displaying the same information as the lead dispatch system. "Here is the infamous couch I was telling you about. I can keep an eye on things until I fall asleep and can get the picture right away when I wake up. It allows me to exercise my control fetish, a perfect prerequisite for this job." She finished with an impish grin. "Now, I've managed to pry myself away for the afternoon. How should we spend it?" She led the way out one of the back doors of the station and over to a cluster of benches. "It’s much nicer out here. You know, there’s a place you might like, if you don't mind a bit of a walk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, lead on!" Merris set a brisk pace up the valley behind the station. They hiked in silence for a while, enjoying the sunshine and air. After about a kilometer Merris turned up a narrow side canyon that began to climb steeply into the dense forest of the slopes. Fifteen minutes later they struggled up one last steep slope and into a hanging meadow. In the center was a small lake, fed from the surrounding mountains. A grassy swath lined the edge of the lake nearest them, with several large fallen trees providing rude benches. Its beauty took Kali's breath away. "It's wicked awesome!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I come up here when I need a break. Nobody else really knows it's here. There's another lake in the lower valley, most of us just go there, it's not quite as pretty though." They slowly made their way to one of the logs and sat down. Each wrapped in her own thoughts, they stared out across the lake and to the mountains beyond. "How're you doing? Settling in ok? Most of the time its not that exciting right at the first," Merris asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm doing ok, I think. Just confused about a lot of things. Like how a few emails about a cool story idea could change into this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone’s arrival here is strange in some way. I think it must be the nature of the place. As to the email, well, there are those who move between the Realms scouting for others who would fit here. This isn't ‘heaven’, the 'havens', or whatever you'd consider the afterlife to be in the usual sense. We can die here. When we do, it is the final death, there is nothing left to cycle back around. So we do need to find others to continue the work."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Might I ask how you came to be here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It’s usually considered impolite to ask, but that’s ok. I was in Duluth, Minnesota, in a punker band and into trouble a lot. One night we played a gig near the waterfront and got really fucked up. During the gig one of the lake’s frequent storms came up. By the time we were ready to quit for the night the rain was pounding and wind was gusting. One of my band mates dared me to walk the top of the breakwater along the ship way. Never one to refuse a dare, especially from them, I hauled myself up and started walking. At first it wasn't very hard, until the wind started picking up. Full of myself I climbed around the weather gate and continued out to the lighthouse at the very end and was about to jump down onto the walkway and head back. A particularly big gust caught me and threw me into the water instead. The shock sobered me up quick, but a wave threw me against the concrete and about blacked me out. As I faded out I saw a woman leaning out from a train car offering me a hand up out of the water. I grabbed on for dear life and ended up here. I still don't know exactly what the selection process involves. I can't think of anything that I did that would land me here. What brought you here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much that I can think of. It had been a terrible night at the end of a bad week. I had gone to my favorite place to eat and encountered my ex-partner and her latest. I paid for the food I didn't eat and left. It was raining and one of those delightful blustery nights that guaranteed I wouldn't be bothered as I walked home. As I passed one of the side streets I saw a tram that didn't seem to belong. When I approached, the driver offered me a ride and he brought me here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, you are one of the Shadow Walkers. I was wondering. I thought you were but then you changed so quickly and completely. Usually Walkers don't change very much at all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shadow Walkers? What’s that? Changed? Oh, right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shadow Walking means you can return to the realms any time you wish. You didn't die to come here. It is a great blessing..." Merris stopped mid sentence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali waited for her to continue having heard something in her voice that implied it wasn't really a great blessing at all. "There’s more than that, isn't there?" Merris looked away, embarrassed. "Please, tell me. Look, nobody will tell me what's the what around here. Please don't you do it too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris began slowly and softly. "It’s also something of a curse, or so it seems to me. Now, remember, I haven't known many Walkers, so this observation is based on a very small sample. They were never able to enjoy what they had. It was like there was something always chasing them, driving them from place to place, adventure to adventure. They always volunteered for the most dangerous missions and threw themselves into the most intense activities. It was almost like they had a bit of a death wish."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A cold shiver ran up Kali’s back as Merris spoke. She remembered all those times when it felt like she had been pacing a cage in her day-to-day life. It was that restlessness that had driven her into the tram. "We're not all like that. I want a quiet place and minimal danger. What?" Merris eyebrows had shot up as Kali talked. "Really, I'm not like that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right. Within the first few days of arrival you have already gone off on a very dangerous rescue. And, rather than stay safely in the background, you leapt into the very center of it. Then you want to be a part of the extraction missions instead of the safer recovery groups."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked away, unable to deny it. After a couple of quiet minutes she turned back and gave a lopsided grin. "Maybe I'm guilty as charged." A few minutes later she asked, "Do you still play music then?" attempting to change the conversation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I was getting tired of it anyway. All we ever did was scream and play thrash chords. I wanted more room. Then when I got here, well there was so much happening I never really got back into it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you ever think of it? Would you want to get back into it? You could always go solo and do what you'd want."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, maybe. If I could find the time, but I'd like it to be with others, doing interesting stuff."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They sat for a while longer watching the afternoon shadows flow slowly toward evening. Finally Kali stood and said, "I suppose we should be finding our way back." Merris stood and watched her for a moment, fighting to keep the rueful grin off her face. Kali stopped when she saw it and blushed. "I guess I do have trouble sitting still sometimes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly they made their way back down toward the station. As they went they swapped stories of growing up around Lake Superior and Fairbanks, Alaska. The station was a warm pool of light in the darkness when they arrived. "You can stay here tonight, if you want, or there are trains headed down all night. There’s always traffic through the Portal."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess it wouldn't hurt to hang out till morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good!" Merris exclaimed. "Let me get you settled in a room." it took very little time to find an empty room and get Kali assigned to it for the night. "Sleep well! If you need anything you know where to find me, the ugliest couch in Dispatch."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali laughed, "The only couch in Dispatch. See you in the morning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her demons leapt from the shadows as she closed the door. They chased through her thoughts, replacing the pleasures of the day with dark insecurities. Her mind dredged up every scrap of conversation and examined it for hidden meanings. By the time her head hit the pillow she was convinced the growing attraction she had felt all day was only in her imagination. Sleep slid up over her and dragged her into chaotic dreams that lasted most of the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She awoke slightly depressed and irritable. She hesitated outside the door to dispatch, thinking for a moment of just leaving, but then turned and entered. Merris was at one of the consoles rapidly tapping keys. She glanced up ready to snap at the intruder until she saw it was Kali. Then she stood quickly and practically tackled Kali in a huge hug. Several others in the room glanced up in surprise, before turning back to their consoles. "Hey there! How'd you sleep? I'm glad you stayed!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Um, ah, fine," this wasn't what Kali had expected and it caught her completely by surprise. Then the warmth of the day before slowly returned and she smiled back. "I'm glad I stayed too! What’s the what? It looks crazy in here again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yup, just like I like it. It’s pretty normal though, but it does mean I won't be able to get away today." She twisted her mouth into a comic pout before continuing, "But I'm thinking I might head down your way tomorrow or the next night. Is that floor space still available?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Always!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You going back, or staying for a while?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was thinking of going back down. Yeah, mostly restless I guess," she said as a haunted look passed quickly over her face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't think I blame you much. It'd be pretty dull sitting here watching the rest of us work. See you in a day or two then," Merris grabbed her into a long hug, kissed her cheek, and let her go.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The train deposited her back at Central Station. Walking through the mid morning sunshine she found herself lost in thought. Her mind wouldn't stop whirling around bouncing from relationships, to Death City, to missions, and around again. She couldn't decide if she wanted another close relationship this soon after the disastrous one with Anne.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her footsteps took her to the narrow alley behind her building. She came out of her trance as Old Lizabet spoke, "Ye be troubled. Be it somethin ye’d like to talk about?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, I'm just not sure even what is bothering me so much. Things just seem to be happening really fast. There are so many different directions I can go here and I don't know how to deal with it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ye have an idea about most things, don't ye? What be really troubling ye?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked down at the cracked paving stones before softly answering, "Merris. I don't know what she wants. She’s attractive to me and it scares me. I don't think I'm ready for anything more serious than friendship. Maybe that’s all she wants, but..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ye think she wants more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ye want more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, no, I think so. I don't want to get entangled. I don't even know who I am right now, or what I'm doing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Listen to yer friends. Stop thinking so much and let things happen as they may. Ye might become friends, ye might become more. Let it unfold as it will. If ye want more, romance her and see what happens."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I'm not ready!" She remained silent. Kali sank into thought, finally continuing, "But I guess people rarely are, are they." Lizabet smiled. They sat in silence a while longer, then Kali rose and left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She paced her apartment unsettled and restless as she struggled again with what she wanted. Trying to distract herself she looked through the books in the study, turned on the computer and tried to lose herself finding out what was on it. She started reading one of the stories she was working on. For a few minutes it was ok, then her muscles started to cramp and spasm. Next her skin started feeling scratchy and irritated with the chair. Standing helped a little bit, but moving helped more. When she sat back down her heart sped up and the cramps returned with more force.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stood again and paced around the room, then out into the hall. At the dance studio she paused, then entered. After a moment she stalked over to the stereo and pawed through the CD collection. Strange names stared back at her as she grabbed six at random and stuffed them into the changer. She pushed start and immediately the dark chords and ripping bass of goth and industrial music thundered through the room. It wrenched her into motion. She danced in flailing abandon as the dark beats soothed something savage in her depths.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Power flared and crackled along her nerves drawing her further and further into the dance until she snapped onto the Pattern. She danced herself into it, joining with it for moments at a time. It surged and ebbed in her blood as a tidal force of raw energy. She danced until the music hit a crashing peak and finally released her. Spent, she collapsed to the floor as soothing flamenco washed over her from the Segovia disk she'd grabbed last.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the last guitar sounds faded she drifted back awake. Covered in dried sweat and shaking with fatigue she staggered into the bathroom and turned on the tub. She half climbed, half fell, into the rising water. Its warmth washed over her easing her into almost slumber. For once her thoughts remained strangely quiet as the tub slowly filled. She awoke as the water cooled to discomfort. Slowly drawing herself upright she pulled off her soaked clothes and dried off before stumbling upstairs to bed.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Hours later she awoke to the late afternoon sun streaming in through her windows. Throwing on a large shirt she prowled down to the study and called Merris. "Hey, I made it back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad. Was it ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't bad," she paused, not sure how to answer the unspoken question. "I, uh, I would have called sooner but I, ummm..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, it’s ok. You didn't have to call at all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wanted to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad." Something in Merris voice left her grinning like a fool as she signed off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She made her way to the kitchen and fixed herself dinner. She carried it out into the garden and ate slowly as the sun faded and the fireflies awoke.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Morning found her at the Adam and Eve for breakfast. "Jo, are there any places where they play goth or industrial kinds of music?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's the Devil's Cathouse. It's in one of the empty industrial buildings across the river." She gave Kali the simple directions to it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart’s grin at the yards prompted an answering one before Kali even thought about it. "Had a good trip did you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I did."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They worked quietly until Kali was summoned to the com. She stuck her tongue out at Bart when she heard his, "Ah, the ritual continues." She returned shortly with another silly grin on her face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, you going to be here tomorrow, or you going back up to the Portal?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll be here. Merris is coming down. She'll be here day after tomorrow by the time I'd normally leave," Kali replied without thinking and then blushed. "Gods, I'm so transparent. Laugh it up master mechanic," she added smiling through her blush.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart laughed and then turned serious. "I think it’s great. She needs to find the fun in life again. So do you, although you aren't as broody as you want me to believe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's that supposed to mean?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I mean you come in every morning looking haunted and pensive. As soon as you step through the door you're cutting up with the rest of us. When you're by yourself I get the idea you're thinking too much. Everything looks bleak until you are with friends, then you're happy again." Kali stared at him with a disbelieving look. "See? Now you're staring like I'm crazy. I've seen you come into the Adam and Eve trying to wear danger like a poorly fitting coat. I haven't known you long, but you don't have to pretend to it. You naturally ooze 'Don't Fuck With Me' more than anyone I know. Bravado got you to this shop, but 'don't fuck with me' has you holding your own against this bunch. Relax you're stronger and more dangerous than you think you are." He turned to return to work, pausing just long enough to add mischievously, "Besides, Merris likes you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smacked his arm with a barely hidden grin and a muttered, "You, I'll show you danger, Mr. Mechanic."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah? You and what army?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Arg, that’s what. Just Arg. So there." She stuck her tongue out at him again. "This is just so high school."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So why are you enjoying it then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe because it’s more fun this time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the day seemed to alternately drag on for eternities or fly by. Merris wasn't arriving until the following day and she could barely wait, so even the most exciting work seemed to drag. At last she was at a stopping point and could take her leave of the yards. At home she ended up making a simple dinner which she ate in the rooftop garden once again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a time she was content to watch the shifting patterns of light dance and fade in the garden. As twilight faded into night restlessness pulled her out of her chair and back into the flat. She thought about sleep until she realized she was too wound up to even try.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later she descended to the street and headed for the river bridge nearby. Her feet took her across and then threaded her through the shadows toward the crumbling industrial section of Death City. Following Jo's directions she slipped through the deep shadows to the abandoned areas where the Devil's Cathouse held residence in a disused building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A wall of sound spilled out the open doorway halfway down the dark alley. Drawn and repelled she hovered in the shadows. Slowly her feet drew her closer until she stopped at the edge of the last shadow. Swirling multi-colored light pulsed from the open doorway where several figures were clustered. She turned with the thought of fleeing back into the night until the opening beats of Eurydice by The Cruxshadows pounded into the night. Drawn in spite of her reluctance she slipped to the door and through it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside a high ceilinged room housed a busy club and bar. Fancy wallpaper and ornate lamps gave the room the aura of an old west cathouse. Lights and music pulsed from an open pit in the center, where the heavy scarred wooden floor had been removed and the basement turned into the dance floor. The music was deafening even at bar level. It crashed through her head and soothed the raw edge of fear that was clawing at her mind. The sound pulled her around the tables and people to the stairs down. She stopped as she saw the maelstrom of swirling writhing bodies. The fear broke through then, driving her into a shadowed corner of the enormous bar crouching near the side wall of the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She perched on the only empty stool, in the darkest corner, at the far end of the bar. Fear clawed its way up her throat as the press of people overpowered the call of the music. Looking around she noticed she was the only one not dressed in some type of exotic costume. She huddled deeper into the shadows, struggling between the desire to run and the enjoyment of the music. She was preparing to flee when Abney Park's Black Day wove through her head and drove the fear far enough back that she remained where she was.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What would you like?" A woman's voice pulled her out of her head. She was average height and dressed in a red peasant skirt and poet shirt. Gold glitter makeup highlighted her dark brown eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Totally distracted Kali replied with the first thing she saw on the board behind the bar, "Morphine Drip please." The woman raised an eyebrow and moved over to an elaborate contraption of glassware and tubing. Liquids bubbled and churned as the woman opened several stop-cocks. Fluids mixed and dripped into a waiting test tube. When it was half full the woman closed the valves, picked up the tube, and brought it back to Kali. "One Morphine Drip."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Carefully she accepted the tube and took a small sip. Complex flavors of butterscotch, rum, and almond flooded her mouth. "Wicked! Thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The woman smiled slightly as she replied, "Glad you like it. It's one of our specialties." She looked Kali over carefully. "Haven't come here before have you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. It's kind of obvious, I know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing to be ashamed of, just asking. It's often easier to let go with a costume."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Movement near her caused Kali to twitch her head around as Erick pushed his way up to the bar. "Hey Dementia, how about a Blood Wine?" He glanced over and smiled when he saw Kali. "Kali, hi! I didn't know you came here. Dementia, this is Kali, she's the one who saved my ass the other day."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, interesting name..." Dementia said slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Deliberate, I'm afraid. I changed it shortly before I left the Realms."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks for saving his scrawny ass," Dementia continued.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No problems, I was in the neighborhood anyway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Erick made a show of looking down at his butt before saying, "Hey, it is not scrawny. Just in the neighborhood, huh?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, Kali, you ready for another? And yes it is honey."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled wickedly and replied, "Yes, I would like another."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, Erick, I'll start yours too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And shake it more than once this time. It's nasty when it isn't mixed well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia rolled her eyes and laughed as she moved back to the glassware. "Sure, sure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see you everywhere..." Kali began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, you do seem to pick all my favorite hang-outs." Erick turned a bit more serious for a moment, "So, are you doing ok now? You didn't seem to feel so good about the rescue earlier."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I'm better."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once Dementia had an erlenmeyer flask full of deep red liquid she carefully put a rubber stopper in it and began shaking. She made a great show of walking over toward Erick and shaking it for a really long time before setting it in front of him with a flourish. "Try that. Remember the rules though. If you don't drink it, you wear it." She handed a new test tube to Kali as well, "Kali, here's yours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hooked another one, I see. That seems to be your most popular one so far."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is. Something seems to really work between the butterscotch and the amaretto."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How bad are these?" Kali asked as Dementia handed her the filled tube.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia laughed, "Oh, pretty bad. Mostly it's the 151 rum. I'd try not to do more than a couple an hour unless you've got a good tolerance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You going to sit here and swill those all night or did you come here to dance?" Erick prodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure why I came. I'm not really dressed right for here and..." Kali replied nervously.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're fine. Come, dance. I heard something about a newcomer that kicked ass the other night at the Adam and Eve."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali blushed furiously at his words but turned to consider the dance floor. Fear roiled up her throat as she saw the sea of moving bodies packed into it. People everywhere, pressing in, no safety, no space. Her breathing turned ragged as she fought the panic, desperate not to run and invite attention. She slammed her drink and gasped at the fire trail down her throat. Its burn snapped her out of panic and back to only unreasoning fear. Despair followed almost immediately as a lifetime of fear reached for control. Rage surged then. Red hot and pulsing it collided with the fear and the two fought as Kali drew deep shuddering breaths.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Erick and Dementia looked on in concern as a fog of black and red bands seethed and twisted around Kali. Erick backed up when he thought he saw claws momentarily flash into place on Kali's fingertips. Dementia started to raise her hand, to motion for someone, when the fog dissipated in a small puff of heat. Ice cold pale grey eyes stared out of Kali's face as she raised her head. "Come, dance with me." The words shimmered and flowed in the air, weaving a siren call to all within twenty feet of her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Erick turned enthralled to follow her. Others along the bar stood and followed in Kali's wake. Dementia stepped forward to follow as well and bumped into the bar. She looked around momentarily disoriented, "What just happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So intense was Kali that she didn't notice the entourage following her or how people moved out of her way as she stalked down to the dance floor. She strode to a slightly less packed area of the floor and began to move. Unconsciously the crowd moved back to allow her the space her motions required. By the end of the fourth song the siren call of her voice had faded, leaving people looking about the dance floor, trying to remember when they had gotten there. The crowd slowly moved back in to fill the empty space around her. By the fifth song Erick had returned from his thrall and saw her eyes had finally returned to the warm grey he remembered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After the eighth fast song Erick gasped out, "How about we take a breather?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali grinned at him, "You go ahead, I'm not tired yet. Can't you feel the energy? Breathe it in!" She returned to the dance, lasting 6 more songs before she went to find him where he was sitting near the lower bar. As she approached she saw a familiar face behind the bar. "Hey, battle mage, didn't know you worked here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, warrior woman, what brings you in here? I'm Ennui by the way. We didn't get introduced in all the excitement."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Heya Ennui, I'm Kali, good to meet you. Great job on that defense screen in the tunnel. You really save our asses! The music brought me in," Kali answered. "Could I get another of those morphine things?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Morphine drip?" She nodded. "Sure, coming right up. Anything for you Erick?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm fine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As Ennui moved away Erick asked, "What happened earlier? You want to talk about it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A haunted look flickered across her face before she firmly answered, "No." He was about to push a little harder until he saw the ice demon in her eyes again. She slammed the rest of her drink, smiled a twisted smile, and asked, "You coming?" as she hurried back out onto the dance floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a moment Kali wondered what had happened to Erick until she saw he was still talking to Ennui. She turned and found a space on the dance floor and launched back into the music. Several sets later she threaded her way back to the bar again. When she noticed Erick wasn't there she waved for Ennui to come over. "Did you see where Erick went?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He headed out. Said it was getting late. Did you want another Morphine Drip?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh. Yeah, one more would be wicked, thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui handed the drink to Kali, turned to head down the bar and paused. Something made her turn back and say, "Erick's a nice guy..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali grinned at what she thought were the implications, "I'm not interested in him that way. He's yours as far as I'm concerned."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">That brought a smile and a blush to Ennui's face, "No, that's not what I meant."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was just wondering. He sometimes comes on a bit strong and I was wondering if he offended you or anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stared at Ennui in puzzlement, "I guess I'm confused now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He's just a good friend of mine and I just wanted to let you know he's not a bad guy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I got that part," Kali's tone was starting to cool considerably. "He's also fairly brave and a sensitive kind of guy in a lot of ways. I got that too. I guess I'm curious why you're taking the time to tell a relative stranger all this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cuz he's got the hots for you and I thought you should be warned. Erick latches on to anyone that seems interesting and it often annoys them. And, and I told him you are a Walker..." Kali's eyes turned ice grey as she regarded Ennui coldly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you did that why, exactly?" Her voice was deceptively quiet and intensely menacing, "Don't you think that's going just a bit far?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui nodded nervously but held her ground. "Yes, yes it is. I told him you were and I am. I told him to scare him away, or at least make him think. I told him so you wouldn't have to chase him away or hurt him. I didn't want him to go on about yet another crush. God, I don't know why it's so important to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He's that good a friend then? That you'd risk the wrath of a stranger to protect him?" The ice gave way to a grudging respect. "I admire that." Kali commented as she sipped her drink. "What do you know of this Walker business?" She leaned across the bar again and said very quietly, "I can't get anyone here to answer many questions. Could you help me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui remained silent a long time before replying, "I can try. I don't know how much I will be able to tell you though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything has to be better than nothing."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm going to try and explain this to Erick tomorrow around noon. If you want, you can drop by as well and I'll tell you what I know. You can find us here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a date then." Kali finished her drink, stood, and headed back to the dance floor. As she turned she gave Ennui an almost warm smile and said, "Thank you." Kali danced herself almost to exhaustion, then slipped quietly out of the club.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The adrenaline which had kept her moving and dancing fled once she reached the shadows beyond the door. It left her leaning against a dark building on legs of rubber. Taking frequent breaks she made it to her building in twice the time it normally would have. The climb to her penthouse was torment. She stopped for long rests at every landing. At last she reached the comfort of her rooms. She took one look at the stairs to her bed and flopped down in the pillows of the sitting room instead. She instantly slid into dreamless sleep, waking hours later when she had to visit the bathroom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The next morning she returned to Temple heath and started in on a newer diesel electric. This time Bart stood back and watched, often wondering over to check on other projects. Mid morning Kali let him know she was leaving for a couple of hours to talk to Ennui.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali walked in just as Ennui was saying, "That's just it Erick. It doesn't mean much of anything. We aren't different, just because we arrived differently. This is still a place away from the Realms and a place of healing. Just because we could go back doesn't mean we would want to. I don't understand why this is an issue with so many. Do I seem like the restless type?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, but is it really that simple?" Kali spoke from the door. "Sorry I'm late, I forgot to get directions last night for the open doors. I hope I'm not interrupting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali!" Erick visibly brightened as Ennui rolled her eyes. Kali noticed and grinned at her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do you mean that?" Ennui asked suspiciously.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just are you really that settled? Does it come with time? I, for one, am still restless and uneasy here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Give yourself time. Maybe Walkers are generally restless and maybe they aren't. Does it really matter? What if others are restless as well? Why should it get in the way of helping out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you know about Shadow Walkers and the rest?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want to know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How it works. What's the what of it all. The why's and the wherefore's..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui laughed at that. Kali's answering glare forced her to answer, "I don't know either. I'm still trying to figure out why me. Dementia's still trying to figure out why her and she's been here for decades. If you want answers you might have to go to an afterlife and then, I suspect, you'll only get the 'official' story based on that godling's view." Kali growled low in her throat, for a moment sounding like a large predatory cat. "I'm sorry. I want to help you, and myself, and Erick, but I don't know either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But haven't you gotten anything from being here? Anything at all?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe a little. Walkers seem to be the first choice for interacting with the Realms and for returning the found items to the Realms time streams. Sometimes they are used as recruiters, but not always. That's about all I've found out. It has something to do with being more visible in the Realms. Maybe Merris, head of dispatch, knows something." Ennui added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She doesn't. I asked her a couple of days ago," Kali all but snarled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then, I'm sorry, but you know as much as I do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Argh!" Kali hissed in frustration. "That seems to be the story of this place. No one knows anything or wants to talk about anything! I never was interested in the new age-y way of thinking and here I am in a world a friend and I created..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Whoa, what do you mean by that?" Erick asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I read a story on the internet about this place and started writing to the person who had written it. We started collaborating on other stories about this world. Then after a thoroughly awful week this strange little tram showed up and offered me a ride. It dropped me off here. Since then it's been an exercise in frustration, trying to figure this place out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that necessary? The figuring it out? Isn't it enough to be in a place where what you do matters? That was why I came along, I wanted to do something more important than the bullshit of the Realms." Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, that's part of why I stayed, but I still want to know about how all this works. The part of me that was writing in this world before still wants to understand it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So here's one for you. Do you think you and your friend were making this up or channeling it from what existed?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ma..." Kali stopped abruptly, not sure what she wanted to believe now. "I don't know. I would have said making it up but it seems like it has life of its own. So maybe we were just seeing little pieces of the reality."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would that be so bad?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no I guess not. I've got to go, things to do," Kali stood abruptly.</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">"So do I," Erick popped in. Kali strode back out into the morning sunshine. Erick followed close at her heals. "So, umm, what's it like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What's what like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Being a Walker and all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali spun around and stared at him. "How should I know? That's what I've been trying to find out. What's it like being a dead person?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He stopped startled. "Uh, I don't feel dead."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So that's what it's like to be a Walker. It doesn't feel any different than when I was walking around the Realms, trying to survive life. What does feel different is how much nicer this place is. I don't have a suck-ass boss watching my every action, writing me up for bullshit like walking in late in the morning. It's like a wonderful dream that I am terrified will end unexpectedly and then I'll wake up back in the hell that was my life." Her eyes flashed cold fire as she said the last. Smitten, he just stared at her with awe in his eyes. "Now, I should get back to Temple Heath, I've got an engine waiting for me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She hurried away as he stared after her. Slowly he turned and headed back toward the club building. He thought of talking to Ennui, changed his mind, and headed back to his rooms instead.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali returned to the locomotive she was working on. Her mind still unsettled by even more answerless questions. Bart found her later slumped in the control chair staring out into the shop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You ok? It's ok not to know what to do at first."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She replied with a tired smile. "Just thinking about all the questions I have that no one has answers to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Life doesn't have answers all the time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Isn't this the afterlife? Aren't you supposed to get the answers in the afterlife? Besides, the engineer in me is used to getting an idea of how something works. This is making me crazy. Mostly I'm afraid it will end and I'll be back in the Realms, bored out of my fucking mind. And now Erick is hitting on me besides. It was easier when I wasn't attractive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, this is an afterlife of a form, still doesn't mean there are answers," he smiled, getting a rueful grin from Kali in return. "You won't wake up back in the Realms. You're here until you decide to leave or until you die. That is a given. As for Erick, well, he is sort of a known problem. He chases everyone that is intense. He would have targeted you, regardless, after the rescue. You can ask Ennui about him. She probably knows him best of all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, maybe I'll talk to her. Guess, maybe I should get back to work, huh boss?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you think I'm paying you to sit here on your ass?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You aren't paying me," Kali laughed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well, get back to work anyway!" Bart snarled through his grin. Kali turned back to the controller she had half disassembled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">An hour later she was still staring at the schematics and mumbling to herself when Bart walked up again. She spared him only a short look when he asked, "You doing ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a NAME="settle_templedance"><a href="k_fp_sections.htm#fp_templedance">first person perspective</a></p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. It isn't making any sense. I don't see anything that could cause the problems we are seeing." Kali pushed a hand through her tangled hair. "Damn it, what the fuck am I missing?" She muttered as she continued to stare at the drawings. Frustrated energy rolled off her in almost visible waves. "I'll be back," Kali said suddenly as she abruptly stood, stalked to the door, and out into the yards.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a few minutes Bart managed to ignore the strangeness, then curiosity took hold of him. He strode to the door and stepped out into the afternoon light. In the middle of an open space he saw Kali whirling in a breathtaking sequence of dance steps. The sunlight painted fiery highlights in the tangle of her hair. The baggy coverall she wore in no way hid the grace and sureness of her movements.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart stopped, transfixed. Behind him the door opened and Mark emerged, "Hey Bart..." his voice trailed to a stop. "Wow, is that..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, yes." For long minutes they stood and watched the strenuous routine going on in the yard. At last Bart shook himself loose and asked, "What did you need Mark?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, uh, yeah, I need a second opinion on that diesel loco in bay three. Did you know she could do that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I'd heard she went to the Cathouse, but I didn't know she was a real dancer." They watched for a few minutes more before returning to the shop. "Don't say anything. I don't know how she'd take it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How she'd take it? Bart, she's taken everything we've thrown at her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, but she may be really sensitive about this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When she's that good?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're still new here. All of us have hurts from the Realms. I don't know if this is one of hers, so until we do, please leave it be."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mark looked skeptically at him before finally nodding assent. As he turned and headed into the shop, he mumbled almost silently, "The Cathouse, hmmm."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later Kali slipped back through the door and glided back to the locomotive. Suddenly she was flipping through diagrams. Then, with a muttered curse, she darted into the storage area. "Hey Claire, where were those diagrams for the EMD locomotives again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Over here, in back of this cabinet," A dark brown haired head popped out from behind a large drawing cabinet to answer. The rest of Claire followed shortly. Her five foot three frame shorter than the large cabinet she had been working behind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked, thanks Claire." She slipped behind the other woman and scanned the drawers of another massive cabinet until she found the unit she needed. Kali grabbed the thick stack of electrical diagrams and hurried over to her bench. She shuffled through them until she found what she was looking for near the bottom of the stack. "Now I've got you!" She dashed back to the locomotive and started pulling even more access panels open.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She finished a little early and headed out. At the Adam and Eve she ordered a quick meal at the bar, ate, and left. Back at her apartment she walked to the dance studio, shoved CDs into the changer, and let them play. The music didn't pull her in like it had the first time. It felt distant and lifeless. She tried to spin into a dance routine but couldn't quite hit the groove. Half way through the first disk she gave up and stalked out of the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She prowled into the office and fired up the computer, thinking to take her mind off things with a little surfing. Nothing caught her interest. Minutes later she leapt to her feet and paced to the stairs down. Her feet had her through the door, down, and headed for the Cathouse before she had made the conscious choice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She slowed as she reached the edge of the shadows near the door. She hesitated on the edge of turning away until a familiar song drifted into the night. It helped her from the shadows and through the door. She froze when she saw the crowd inside, then the music shifted into driving beats and pounding notes. It throbbed in her blood and beat against her skin driving out the terror with wild energy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She dashed down the steps and launched into dance from the last steps. Riding the current of the music she whirled her way into the crowd. Sightless eyes failed to notice the attention her routine drew.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several songs later she drifted back to awareness and slipped toward the bar.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Warrior woman," Ennui greeted her warmly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Battle mage," Kali returned. "Could I get water and a Morphine Drip?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Certainly. It'll be right up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When Ennui returned with the drinks she said, "I'd like to talk to you a bit more, somewhere alone. Any way you can grab a few minutes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, just a minute." She slipped into the back for a few minutes and returned with a tall woman in a brown monk's robe trailing her. "Upstairs?" Kali nodded and Ennui waved her around the end of the bar. She grabbed her drinks and followed Ennui through the back way up to the private rooms above. Ennui motioned Kali into one of the comfortable chairs and settled into another one herself. Then she asked, "So?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali started abruptly. "Erick, I'd like you to tell me how to deal with Erick. He seems to think I'm interested in him. I'm not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't take this wrong, ok? Erick falls in lust with any woman who can kick ass. He latched onto you because you did what you did in the fight where he met you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So the next person that comes along will divert his attentions? Wicked awesome. Maybe I can find someone to do it sooner."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's how it works with him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you interested in him?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not at all," Ennui answered with a bit of a laugh. "I already have someone. Someone unexpected. Why am I telling you this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Because I have a friendly face?" Kali answered almost sarcastically.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why are you so prickly?" Ennui asked, momentarily stung.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali's eyes flashed as she stood and paced jerkily, "Because I'm terrified, ok?" She spun to stare at Ennui. "Look at me. This isn't me. I was..." she stopped before she blurted it all out. "Different, when I came here. A nebbish, an office slug with barely enough energy to walk home, a frightened mouse quaking at the shadows. Ugly, dumpy, something you wouldn't bother to notice on the streets." Ennui bit back a disbelieving statement as a hash laugh burst from Kali. Shaky hands pushed through her tangled hair. "Look at this," she said as she executed a perfect pirouette. "In the Realms I could barely walk without tripping and now..." her voice trailed off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't understand. Don't you want to dance?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, more than anything," Kali said softly as she folded down to the floor. Her nervous energy momentarily stilled. "This is everything I've always wanted and I am so scared I'll lose it." Tears sprang into her eyes and spilled over. "Every time I got something I wanted in the Realms it was taken away. How can this be any different? How?" The nervous energy pulled her to her feet in a graceful spring. She half danced, half stalked around the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Lady isn't a proxy godling. She is not that cruel."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali slowed, eyes downcast, "My heart knows, I think. My head, I don't know, my head and heart never really talked, you know?" she replied half bitter, half sad.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do they now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, no, maybe, I don't know. Gods," her hands pushed through her hair again as she stared up at the ceiling. "I just wanted answers. This is the fucking afterlife and still there aren't any answers!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What am I supposed to say?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. Fuck!" Kali dropped back into the chair and stared up at the ceiling again. Suddenly she asked, "How do you do it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Get comfortable here? Believe it is really real?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Give yourself time. It took me a while to believe it as well. It's a hell of a shock to come here. Maybe even more for us Walkers, I don't know. Those that die, well, they have to know at some level, even if they can deny it because they still have form. You, me, we came here, but we could go back. I don't know about you, but I'm scared I will be forced to go back and I don't want to go back, but I do too. There are people I wasn't ready to be done with and yet, if I go back, is it really me, or the me they knew anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hated it there. So many times I was so close to ending it. I want to stay here so badly and it always seemed like the more I wanted something the less likely it was to happen, or to last if it did. When I was young I prayed for visions, for a mission, a golden path to take me the fuck out of there. I even made up crazy stories that were more real to me than where I was. One day I realized they could never be more than just stories and most of me died." She paused and the pause stretched out into silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is real. Believe it. Believe the Lady. You more than most should know that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean me more than most?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She touched you, anyone with eyes can see that. Where do you think that raw energy of yours comes from? Who do you think changed you?" Ennui leaned forward, "Tell me, haven't you felt more alive, more yourself since you came here? She won't take that back. This dream is the true reality under the Realms."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, maybe." Kali sat forward and stared into the distance for long moments. Some of the crackling energy faded as she sat. When she looked at Ennui again her eyes were almost calm. She blushed bright red as she thought of the questions Bart had brought to mind. "Can I ask something?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You may," Ennui answered uncertainly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali turned even more red as she stammered, "How do the biological things work here? Will I, will I, bleed, each month? Do I have to worry about, ah, about getting pregnant?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, you will still get periods here. You probably won't get PMS though. I used to get it bad some months, but I haven't here. Pregnancy, no. This is Death City after all. This is about healing, not about new life."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, ok, thanks. I think I need to dance some more." Kali rose rapidly and headed toward the door. She practically ran down the stairs with confused fears and thoughts banging around in her head. The internal voice berated her for asking such telling questions while a second, more rational one, tried to calm her down. On the dance floor she found the darkest corner available and slid back into the music.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mark looked up startled as he saw Kali dash from behind the bar. His eyes followed her as she launched into a routine in a shadowed corner. For the rest of the night he watched as her body wove out patterns to every song DJ Davros spun. Once in a while she would take a break, long enough to get a drink, but mostly she remained in motion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">DJ Davros wound down near two in the morning. Mark led the applause that greeted her as she gracefully bowed to Davros. Face flaming she ran into the night, not stopping until she was safely in the shadows. Panting and shaking, she leaned against a closed door and tried to slow her frantic heart. She made her way home once the shakes had stopped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the safety of her flat she stared at her reflection in the bathroom mirror. "Why were you so afraid? Why did you run?" she asked the face staring back at her. The face stared silently back. Long moments later she slowly stripped off the flight suit and turned on the shower.</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">She slid into Temple Heath later than usual the next morning. Avoiding as many people as she could, she returned to the locomotive servo systems. She had just slipped under the main panel when a small cough intruded. She slid out to find Mark standing nervously in the doorway. "I, umm, I want to apologize for last night. I didn't mean to embarrass you or to be cruel in any way. It's just you are such an incredible dancer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fear constricted her heart from the attention, but a tiny blossom of pride was there as well. For just a second it felt really good to be appreciated. "Thank," she swallowed hard and tried again, "Thank you. I, I uh I'm sorry it rattled me so badly." Silently she cursed the nervousness that had turned her face flaming red again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once she has finished the servo system repairs she rose, grabbed the large stack of plans, and headed back to the storage rooms. She was setting the drawings back in place when Claire called, "Hey dancer-lady, how are you today?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali spun, face flaming again. "What?" she mumbled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I saw you at the Cathouse last night. Very nice moves by the way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, uh, thanks. I'm fine, I guess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, if I'd tried to dance that long I would still be flat out in bed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, oh," Still flustered, Kali turned back to putting away her drawings. Claire stared at her for a moment longer then turned to return to the shop. "Uh, Claire?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes?" Claire turned back to Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was wondering where I could find something better to wear there," Kali replied, chewing on her bottom lip nervously.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There's a couple of places in town. There're some in Goth City, up the line towards Portal Station, that are even better." Claire continued after a brief pause, "We could go shopping sometime if you'd like."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd like that," Kali replied with a shy smile. "Maybe tomorrow after we're done here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cool, it'll be a blast."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the day passed even more slowly for Kali.</p>
