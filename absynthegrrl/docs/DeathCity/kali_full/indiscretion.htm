<p class="pagecaption">Indiscretion</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* "drunken indiscretion" - a fair amount of time after the assembly of the full team, but still a while before the endings */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shit, shit, shit! I can't believe I missed that," Kali cursed as she paced the company car main room. She reached into the front cabinet, pulled out a bottle of slivovitz, and took a long pull. It burned like fire going down, but tasted wonderful across her tongue. She took a smaller sip and rolled it around her mouth, savoring the fermented plum flavor and the harsh bite of it. As the alcohol started to take the edge off her rage and fear, her pacing slowed and finally stopped, leaving her staring out the window at the void beyond the train.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bottle was two-thirds empty and she was still staring out the window when Petrov entered from the forward passage. "I can't believe I missed that," she said in a quiet, sad voice. Her hand moved the bottle to her mouth and she took another pull.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But we recovered from it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And nearly lost an entire squad."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But we didn't. You got us out, without casualties."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali spun to face him. "How many more times can I do that? What happens when I fail?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then some of us will die. It's the way of it," his voice was calm and mater of fact. It goaded her and saddened her in equal measure.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's not acceptable!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Petrov grabbed her shoulders and shook her lightly. "It is the way of it. You know that, you who seek death in the Lady's service."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not acceptable for others to die!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He pulled her against his chest, surprised when she let him. She was surprised that she let him as well, and more surprised at how good it felt to be held close by him. "Death happens. It is the other side of the dance. You showed me that." One hand unconciously stroked her hair. It stopped the instant he realized what he was doing. Kali rubbed her head against his still hand, wanting the warmth of the gesture to return. She turned her head and managed to get another long drink from her bottle before he carefully removed it from her grasp. "Bitter experience has proven this doesn't help." He leaned over and set the bottle on the window ledge before wrapping his arms around her again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* they <a href="file://z:/shapes/PenetrationFeelings.txt">sleep</a> together after getting drunk trying to unwind from the disaster they just barely averted. in the morning they both recognize the impossibility of a relationship and the mistake this was from a tactical/team related basis. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This was a mistake," they both said at once. Petrov moved to get up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stay," Kali said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is that a command, ma'am?" Petrov asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it's a request from a woman who wants to stay in the fantasy for a little bit longer." He laid back on the bed and Kali draped herself over his massive chest again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* what surprises Kali the most is the weird feeling of safety and comfort that comes from being held by someone of Petrov's size */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Ennui - how was he? Kali - mind numbingly wonderful. he was rough enough, considerate enough, and skilled enough. it was the best sex i've ever had. we didn't have to worry about breaking each other and that made it all the more amazing */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We had a few dirnks and were talking, then hugging, then..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He shouldn't have..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I jumped him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You...jumped...him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. He was being reasonable and thoughtful, saying we shouldn't but I really wanted to. He held me and it felt so safe and warm and wonderful and it made me insanely hot."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So he didn't force you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"More like I sort of forced him, the first time anyway. After that, well, it seemed very mutual. We spent the trip back in his room. Gods it was so wonderful!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't understand, what are you so unhappy about then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hate that my body craves it again. The cuddling and holding even more than the awesome sex. All my previous flings have been just that. Hello, let's fuck, see you around. With Petrov, I want to cuddle up in his arms, snuggle in with him at night, and lose myself in his warmth. But I hate that stereotyped response in myself, and I still want Merris, and I'm afraid I'll lose too much of myself if I give in to this Petrov obsession at all. Gods, I got so annoyed with friends of mine when they'd find a man attractive because he was big, strong, and confident. Now I'm following the same fucked up stereotype. I hate it!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't really tell you what to do. You need to figure out what you need and what you want. Then decide if your wants can be met while your needs are. I will say you need to talk to Merris and Petrov."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't want to hurt anyone."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"One of the sad truths of life is you will give and recieve hurt. The only thing you can do is try to make it on the best terms. If this situation sorts itself out through random chance, there will be a great deal of hurt to all involved. You need to figure out what you want and need, then work it out, and fairly soon."</p>
