<p class="regtxt5">Slowly she walked over. She stood uncertainly until Kali noticed her. "Hey, I made it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, so you did." For a few more moments they stood shyly looking at each other until Kali grinned and said, "Fuck it." She strode over and swept Merris into a hug. Bart started clapping as they backed away from each other their faces bright red in the lights of the shop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Merris, good to see you down here in the real world again," Bart teased gently.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I'm not at Portal Station," Merris answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you would consider that the real world?" Bart asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. Wouldn't you?" Merris looked actually puzzled before a huge grin split her face. "So Kali, you done here or should I come back later?" Merris asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Go, take Merris out and show her the real world. I think that rarified air up there near the Portal is addling her brains."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Be careful there master mechanic. I might just need to send you on a really long recovery mission. Never know when you might be needed..." Merris replied evilly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart just grinned and waved them away. "Go on now. I wouldn't ok any locomotives or rolling stock for such a trip."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, that's kind of a laugh. I haven't been here long enough to know what to show you." Kali muttered as Merris led the way out of Temple Heath.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wouldn't worry about it. Going to the Adam and Eve for dinner and then staying and listening to the Temple Heath regulars would be a wonderful evening. It would take my mind off the latest in a long series of dangerous extractions. Everything turned out all right, but it was close for a little bit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They had settled down, gotten food and drink, and were relaxing when the rest of the Temple Heath crowd meandered in. "And this is your definition of showing her the town?" Bart prodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's in town and she is seeing it, so yes," Kali replied grinning. "We require sustenance before walking about and all the rest, lest we grow faint with hunger and lack of good drink. And there is all this quality companionship. How could we refuse such a boon as this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fancy words miss newcomer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just because I fix things doesn't mean I can't talk all pretty. So sit, eat, and drink with us then and I'll shut up." And the rowdy Temple Heath regulars settled in for another night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The table looked up when Allen called, "Hey, over here. Don't be strangers, come join us!" Dementia and Ennui were just settling down at a table of their own.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia shook her head as Bart chimed in, "Come on over Dementia. I haven't seen much of you these past months. I'd think you had a new partner or something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia and Ennui blushed deep red as they slowly rose and walked to the Temple Heath table. "As a matter of fact I do. Bart, you remember Ennui don't you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He smiled brightly, "Of course I do! Good to see you again. I'm glad you get along with her. She does better when she's not alone." He stopped when he saw Dementia looking uncomfortable. "Sit and be welcome with us." He turned and waved at the table, "This is the Temple Heath regulars. Merris I'm sure you know..." He added, waving to where Merris sat next to Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The stories and conversation continued rough and rowdy long into the night. Ennui and Dementia faded shortly after they finished their meals. The gap left in conversation by their departure was rapidly filled as glasses were refilled and the stories continued. It was nearly 0100 when Kali and Merris staggered up the stairs to Kali's flat. After a few words of goodnight and several glasses of water they collapsed into their beds, Kali up in her bedroom and Merris in a nest of pillows in the sitting room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali woke suddenly an hour later. Energy zipped and fizzed through her like worms wriggling under her skin. The sheet was sandpaper on her exposed legs and arms. Nerves screamed with the need to move. For a while she fought with it. Just when her eyes would start to close her heart would suddenly pound and the wriggling would start up again. Unconscious tension made her joints ache and burn while the pounding of her blood made her hands and feet feel bloated and stiff.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Half an hour later she gave up and jumped out of bed. Silently she danced around her room. Harder and harder she pushed until sweat rolled off her, until her lungs and muscles burned. Still the energy crackled and sizzled in her veins. Frantically she pushed even harder, striving to move faster, stretch farther, and leap higher. Muscles screamed, her lungs sucked huge gulps of air down her raw throat, her vision dimmed with the pumping of her heart until, at last, the energy fled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She dropped like a marionette with cut strings and lay spent on the floor. Her muscles were still twitching and spasming as a tousled head appeared on the stairs. "Are you ok? I heard a thump a minute ago." Merris asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali tried to sit up but her muscles wouldn't do it. "Couldn't sleep," she whispered through her raw throat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So you stood up and fell over?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very funny. I was dancing if you must know." Her face burned at the admission. Part of her couldn't understand why she should feel ashamed, but she did.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you fell? The bed is better for resting than the floor." Merris asked, concerned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can't. Please help, too weak to move."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Too weak? How long have you been going?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Started at 0200. Kept going until I couldn't anymore." Kali answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"0200? That was 3 hours ago. And you've been dancing since then? Until you fell?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Didn't fall. Ran out of energy. Help, please." Merris gently helped Kali up and walked her back to the bed. She lifted her legs up and tucked the blankets in around her. "Thank you," Kali said softly, her eyes already sliding toward sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No worries. Why are you embarrassed to dance?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ugly, clumsy, useless," Kali answered half asleep. Merris's sharp inhalation started her awake. Her eyes shot open as she turned bright red. "Forget I said that!" her voice was urgent and strained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a long moment Merris hesitated, staring into the raw fear in Kali's eyes, before replying, "I will, but you aren't. I don't believe you ever were." She stared sadly down at Kali until she saw her eyes close again. Softly she crept from the room, back to her nest of pillows where she lay awake for a very long time.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali was up early with the faintest hint of the worms under her skin again. She slipped quietly into the sitting room and watched Merris sleep for a few long moments before turning to the bathroom for a shower. When she emerged in her sleep T-shirt and hair in a towel Merris blinked sleepily at her. "You should still be sleeping."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Couldn't. This burning restless energy has been building for a few days. It's been letting me sleep less and less of late, although it's kept me going on less sleep than I'm used to as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Adaptation reaction. Everyone that arrives here has something that is completely out of balance for weeks to months after arrival. It'll calm down. It'll just take some time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Great."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could be worse. It looks like you have something that works, as long as you try not to fall down when you're done." Merris added through a grin.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled back through her sudden blush. "You want anything to eat? Or you can go back to sleep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I'm awake. Coffee would be great, maybe food too. Give me a minute and I'll help." Kali headed toward the kitchen while Merris hurried to the toilet. A few minutes later she joined Kali in the kitchen where she started creating an omelet while Kali started the coffee.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris gave Kali a long hug when she left for Temple Heath and explained she had to return to Portal Station fairly early in the day. "I'm afraid I won't be able to stay much past noon. Come see me when you can."</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey Bart, is Kali up there with you?" It was near mid day when Claire's voice floated down to Kali where she was working under the locomotive.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No," Bart replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm over here," Kali answered at the same time. She climbed out of the pit and stood. "Merris, hey," she added shyly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey yourself," Merris said, smiling. "Kali, this is Anastasia. She heads up the extraction team. I told her you were wanting to join up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hi," Anastasia held out a hand while she looked Kali over. She was tall, with a dancer's body. Her face was angular and striking, framed by a riotous tangle of dark red hair, pulled back and tied with a wide leather strip. Her grey eyes were warm, like autumn sunlight on gathering clouds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hi." Kali took the hand briefly after wiping hers on her coveralls. She stared back at Anastasia. She was a bit shorter than Kali or Merris. Her blonde dyed hair was cut short. Her eyes were ringed in black and she wore black lipstick as well. It made her already pale complexion look washed out. She was muscular and self contained, meeting Kali's stare easily.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They looked at each other for a long moment before Anastasia asked, "What has Merris told you about extractions?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much more than I found out for myself. They are dangerous and unpredictable. Also, that I don't have to sign up forever if I freak out. What can you add?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much additional either. Dementia, from the Devil's Cathouse, gets visions which help quite a bit. When she has them they are quite accurate. There is a core team of eight of us that have been doing this since almost the beginning, a little over a year ago." Anastasia looked closely at Kali, "I heard about your mission with Sammi and Jemima. Are you willing to go into battle with the same ferocity next time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia noticed the haunted look pass over Kali's features. "I don't know." She answered honestly. "It still disturbs me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stared deep into Kali's eyes for a long moment. Within she saw an unsettledness. Behind the somewhat cautious look a shadow paced in it's cage. When it detected her stare it turned and looked out at her. In that instant she knew Kali would be fine. "I think you have nothing to worry about. I would be honored to have you on my team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stared back into Anastasia's face. Pain and worry lurked just below the surface. "Thank you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll leave you two to work out the details. I need to talk to Bart then I'm headed back to Portal Station." Merris said as she turned to find Bart.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali grabbed her in a large hug, held on for a moment, then released her. "See you later!" Once Merris had gone Kali asked, "How does this work? Is it like a volunteer fire department where I come and live at the station during my shift?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, nothing quite like that. You get a com unit that has the channels for my team. You agree to keep it with you when you are available and you let me know when you want to turn it off. If you decide to quit, you give it back. When a mission is called, I contact the team over the com units and we gather at Central Station. When everyone is there, we go. I have to warn you though, we don't have the best of equipment for this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I saw that when I went out with Sammi and Jemima."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right, sorry about that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No problem. I don't mind the introductory speech now that I've seen one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's about it really. I am in charge. Follow the lead of the other team members until you figure out your strengths, and try to stay alive. So far we haven't lost anybody..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you are worried about that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, considering what happened to you, and that rescue team, I am very worried."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Count me in, if you'll have me," Kali said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome!" Anastasia smiled. "Here is the com," Anastasia placed a small com unit in Kali's hand. "It'll signal when there is a mission. We have a small group of rooms in the back of Central Station. It's mostly to hold what gear we have and give us a place to meet and plan. If you could come by tomorrow around lunch time it would be great. I can introduce you to the rest of the team and assign you some basic equipment. Sound good?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good by me. Thanks!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart followed her back to the pit. "Extractions? Are you sure? After our conversation the other day..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I'm not sure. I know I crave the excitement though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You realize that will more than compensate for your being here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure I understand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The everyone should contribute guideline of Eternia. If you are doing extractions then you are more than carrying your weight. You don't need to keep working here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you telling me to go away?" Kali asked, hurt by the thought of being asked to leave.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not at all. Just if you end up with too much happening, it's ok to let this go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, because I like being here and I don't want to have to stop coming in. Do extractions really happen that often?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There have been more and more of them. There weren't any at all until about a year ago. Since then the danger has just kept increasing. You be careful. We would all be very unhappy if you were hurt or killed doing this."</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">/* this also has a <a href="k_fp_sections.htm#fp_shop">first person</a> section */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">That evening, after leaving Temple Heath, Claire led the way into a section of town that Kali hadn't seen yet. Narrow cobbled streets twisted their way between wood framed stone and brick buildings. Soft guitar music drifted from the open door of a coffee shop. At last she stopped in front of a store window displaying black corsets, leather and lace dresses, and heavy boots glittering with buckles and zippers. "Here we are, best Gothic fashion shop in all of Death City." Claire commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali followed her into the store and slowed as the familiar brain freeze crept forward when confronted with the vast array of styles. All the times in the Realms of looking at fashions for women smaller than her crashed in on her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali?" Claire asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't even know where to start." Kali answered, lost. A lifetime of nerves and frustration sought to drive her out of the store to the safety of the street. She started to turn to the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire looked at Kali in disbelief, wondering how she could have survived. Then she tried to explain, "I try to start with an idea. Focus on a look you like and try it. That way I only grab a few items at a time to try. Once you have a few items, try them on and see how they look."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stood motionless for long moments as she tried to decide whether to say anything else. Finally she stared around the room, picked a rack of black corset styled crushed velvet tops with large puffy upper sleaves, and picked several sizes off it. Slowly she made her way to a dressing room. Inside she slipped off the upper portion of her flight suit and tested the various sizes until she found the closest one. Lacing up the black laces in the purple front panels she turned to survey the result. She was surprised at how good it looked. Heartened, she hurriedly tied the flight suit arms around her waist, as a make-shift belt, and went in search of a suitable bottom component.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire stared at her judiciously when she walked by. "Um, Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Claire?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The colors are good for you, but you don't really have enough up here," she motioned toward her chest, "for that style to work very well. The sleeves detract from you." She walked over to a different rack and motioned, "Try these instead. They shouldn't overpower you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I couldn't wear anything that short and skimpy!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire just smiled and asked, "What size is that?" When Kali told her, she grabbed the small top and pulled Kali back to the dressing room. "Off with that one." Kali turned bright red, but untied the top and slipped it off. "Ok, first off, loose the sports bra. It might be fine for working at Temple Heath, but it isn't doing you any favors here." She stood impatiently until Kali reluctantly pulled it off, turning an even brighter shade of red as she did so. "You need to find some really nice bras, and you're really lucky, with that set you won't need much support, so the sky's the limit on your choices. Next, with abs like that, you should be showing them off." She pushed the other top into Kali's hands, "Slip that on and you'll see what I'm saying."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali eyed it with suspicion and asked, "Laces to the back, I'm hoping." Claire nodded, trying desperately not to laugh. Kali slipped it over her head and tried to settle it into place. The thin elastic laces pinched, her abs felt draftly, and her breasts unsupported. She squirmed around, trying to get it to feel better.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire reached over, pulled on the back laces a couple of times, shifted the front fabric, and stepped back. "Take a look at that. See what I mean by showing it off? Didn't you ever dress to impress in the Realms?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali shook her head, "I didn't want to be noticed or hit on. Baggy and shapeless was what I wanted. I don't know if you remember how I looked when I first arrived, but I wasn't much to look at."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You were pretty then, too. You could have had your pick of partners with just a little effort."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked down and away, biting her tongue to not disagree. "I'd like to try a few more things on. Would that be ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Within a few minutes she was modeling various combinations for Claire and commenting on Claire's choices. By the time she settled on several outfits, including the top Claire had suggested, she was enjoying herself. She dropped her flight suit in the bags with her other choices and wore her last selections, a long black peasant dress and the small top under a black, long tailed, tuxedo coat. They thanked the shop owner for the creations and stepped outside. "Dinner? We could go somewhere other than the Adam and Eve tonight," Claire asked. Nerves hit Kali as she felt the draftiness of a skirt. It had been a long time since she had worn anything other than pants and the airiness seemed extremely vulnerable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, is there something wicked around here?" She replied in as even a voice as she could.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked?" Claire didn't respond to the nervousness in Kali's voice, only to the strange term she had used.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, interesting, exceptional, fun?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh. Yes, there's this great Armenian cafe just down the block from here. Or there is a good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirogi">pirozhki</a> kitchen a little farther down."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirogi">Pirozhki</a> sound good. I haven't had them in a long time." Kali answered. Claire led the way into the long, narrow shop. A wide walkway went from the door to the counter at the back of the shop where a large older woman waited to take their orders. On the wall to the left were various paintings of forests, horse carts, peasant farmers in bright colored clothes, and a wooden hut with a thatched roof dancing around on chicken legs. To the right was a long display case with many different types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirogi">pirozhki</a> inside. They each selected several different types to try, then made their way back out to find a nearby table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali sat with her back closest to the buildings and Claire settled in next to her. They talked of easy things, Temple Heath, the Devil's Cathouse, food, and trains while they ate. When they were finished Claire asked, "Cathouse?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I want to go back to my place for a few minutes first. I'd like to change my look a bit and drop off the rest of my stuff." Kali replied. Her nerves kept her distracted enough that she didn't see Claire brighten up at the destination.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali led the way once they were back near the cathedral. She showed Claire to the sitting room before heading up to her bedroom. Swiftly she changed into grey leggings and a pixie skirt, immediately feeling less vulnerable in something with less draft. "Do you want to leave your stuff here?" She asked as she came back down.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, thanks. I live at the Cathouse. I'll just take it with me." Claire made a show of looking around. "Nice place you have here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I liked it when I found it," Kali smiled. "Ready?" She asked as she hurried to the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire paused for a moment like she was going to say something. When she saw Kali disappearing down the stairs she hurried after her. "In a hurry?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sort of. I need to dance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Need to?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Need to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where did you learn? I've been taking lessons ever since I got here and I'm still not very good."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I just knew how to once I was here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh wow!" When Kali saw the adoration in Claire's eyes she started walking even faster. Within days of arrival and already three people were interested in her. For a second she thought about running back home, locking the doors, and never coming out. The scurrying energy in her nerves kept her headed toward the Cathouse. Claire had to almost run to keep up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside the Cathouse Kali almost ran for the dance floor, leaving Claire to make her own way to her room. Once she started dancing Kali started to feel better. The music let her forget about the chaotic thoughts bouncing in her head. After several sets she slid through the crowd to the bar. Ennui glanced up, saw her, and made her way over. "Warrior woman, I approve of the new look." Her smile was appreciation without pressure. "Morphine Drip and water?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes please." Kali smiled back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Conversation later?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't, but you looked a bit spooked when you dashed onto the floor. Like two nights ago kind of."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, still a lot on my mind. I need to dance for a while longer first. And I don't have to bother you if you'd rather I didn't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok. Come get me when you're ready." Kali downed the rest of her drink and returned to the dance floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Near midnight she returned to the bar. The Monk had replaced Ennui. "Can I get you anything? Ennui said you can go up any time, if you still want to talk with her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Morphine Drip and water please." Kali sat and sipped the drink after slamming the water. When the test tube was empty she asked for a second one, sipped it even more slowly than the first, and wondered what she would say to Ennui. For a long time she worried whether she should even bother her with more questions. She stared at the second empty Morphine Drip, sighed, and slipped around the end of the bar. The Monk just nodded as she headed back into the private areas.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly she climbed the stairs to the top floor. Outside Ennui's door she hesitated for a long time before starting to turn away. "Were you looking for Ennui? I think she's in." Dementia said as she came up the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not really sure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia stared at her for a long time before saying, "You should come in." She opened the door and motioned for Kali to precede her. Slowly she walked in and stood nervously as Dementia closed the door. Ennui was curled up in a large chair, reading a book. Dementia crossed to her and gave her a quick kiss. Kali turned away embarrassed and looked out the nearest window.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are troubled," Ennui began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Always," Kali replied bitterly. The chaos she had burned away dancing returned in full force. "I'm doing it again. Not even here a month and I'm doing it again." Dementia and Ennui silently watched Kali pace, waiting for her to continue. "I don't want to be attached and I do. When I get attached to someone I hide myself to be what they want. Why do I do that?" Again the other two let the silence stretch out. Almost against her will Kali spoke to fill the void. "They won't like me if they know me. Knowledge is power and every bit of information someone has on me is another weapon they can turn against me. Merris intrigues me, yet I didn't tell her I had been dancing here. We could have come over last night. Instead I tried to sleep, couldn't, and ended up dancing in my room anyway. When she asked about it I was so embarrassed to tell her. This drives me crazy, this shame over everything I do." Ennui drew breath to say something but stopped when Dementia shook her head. A twisted smile curled Kali's lips when she continued, "I always try to attach to someone. That way I don't have to be as pro-active in what I do. But over time I start to resent them for that. It's not really their fault, but... the resentment is still there. I fear doing the same thing with Merris. And Erick is interested, and now Claire, and the gods alone know who else. Why can't I stop talking? Why am I telling you all this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why don't you tell us?" Dementia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali tried to stop talking then, but it twisted inside her until she had to blurt it out. "I'm so sick of hiding. I can't stand what I've been. I want to be more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you want to be?" Ennui asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Me," Kali answered with solid conviction. "I want to know what I am, who I am, whether there is anything left under all the masks I have hidden behind. I can't seem to hide here. I have become...things...done things, gotten... abilities...that are needed. I like to be needed but I don't want to be responsible and being needed means being responsible. I'll just screw it up and then where will everyone be? I don't want my actions to impact others and what I am now, well, it could impact so many."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You didn't have to go on that rescue. What prompted you to?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wanted some excitement. Then I didn't want to die. Then..." Kali stopped abruptly. not wanting to admit what she had told Bart.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Something about that scared you, didn't it? Was it the danger? Was it that other people died?" Dementia asked. "Or did you enjoy it?" Kali's shudder told her everything even as she tried to remain silent. "You enjoyed it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just like with Bart the words clawed their own way out of Kali. "I didn't want to. There were screams, blood, and I dealt death, so much death..." Even now she could see the torn flesh and ichor on her hands, smell the horrible odors. Unbidden the killer slid forward to stare about the room. Ennui edged back in her chair but Dementia remained calm, watching her. "Yesss," It came out in a weird purr, "I enjoyed it. The ultimate dance, the dance of life and death. There is not one without the other. And I was so alive with it!" Terrified Kali scrambled back to the wall and slid down it, hands pressed hard into her eyes, trying to drive the beast back. "Ahhyyiii," escaped in a long shuddering gasp. "No, no...I don't want to be this...."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are scared you will be a killer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia's analytical words brought her head up. "I don't want to be a killer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You killed them to save us. It has always been this way. There is no shame in saving your friends." Ennui added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But I enjoyed it!" Kali shrieked in agony. "I fucking enjoyed it and I want to do it again! It itches and crawls under my skin. The craving for that intensity of feeling."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you want to kill me? How about Ennui, or Bart, or the Temple Heath gang? Is there anyone in Eternia you want to attack right now?" Dementia pressed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Gods, no!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then maybe you are scared of the wrong things," Dementia finished. It wasn't much, but a small knot loosened a bit at her words. "You were touched by the Lady when you arrived. Were you like this in the Realms?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not at all..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then might it not be a gift of hers? And if it is, might there not be a reason, a purpose? You said you wanted to be useful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You dance it away don't you?" Ennui asked. "The crazy energy?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With a thump the pieces fell into place. "Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then keep dancing." She said it as if it were the simplest thing in the world. "So many haven't found an outlet for what eats at them. Allow yourself yours. You deserve it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui missed the twitch that caused but Dementia didn't. It drove Kali to her feet as the fear driven energy sizzled along raw nerves. She turned to go. "And dance I feel the need to do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dementia reached the door before Kali did. Her calm eyes held Kali's wild ones with total immovability. "Running won't make it better. You deserve better than you allow yourself. Your wants are as important as everyone else's. Think about that as you drive yourself to exhaustion." She stepped aside and opened the door as terror propelled Kali into a run. She leapt almost from landing to landing as the headlong rush tumbled her down the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ear splitting and flesh pounding sound crashed into Kali as she ran onto the dance floor. Energy flew from her in shimmering sheets driving the rest of the club goers into a frenzy of motion only slightly slower than her own. The DJ picked up on it as well and kept the music hard and insistent for the next hour. Dancers dropped in droves until Kali was the last one still in motion when closing time neared.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the last song faded into silence Kali staggered to the bar and collapsed onto a stool. "Water, please," she croaked out when the Monk asked. Silently she handed her a pint glass and set a full pitcher next to it. She slammed the first glass and immediately filled another one. She downed two more before rising slowly. "Home, headed home now," she said through her raw throat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stumbled to her flat. She pulled off her boots and fell back onto the bed. For a few minutes sleep claimed her. Then the nightmares started. Shadows chased her through dark hallways. Claws reached for her. She jerked awake. Energy burned fire through her nerves again. Desperately she flailed back into motion, dancing around her room until she couldn't focus, until her limbs would barely move. Every time she sat down the fire surged again, driving her back into motion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She staggered and fell. Still the fire pulled her upright and back into the dance. She fell again and struggled on the floor, still trying to get back into motion. She dragged herself to the bed and pulled herself upright once more. Her motions had become spastic and frantic, still she couldn't stop.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once more she fell. This time she made it half way to her feet before her strength gave out and she fell back. The blankets she clutched fell back on top of her. She rolled and tried to get up on all fours. Instead she collapsed into unconsciousness with the blankets tangled around her.</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">Sunlight streaming in through the east windows woke Kali from the dreamless sleep she had fallen into. Muscles screamed in protest as she tried to move. Slowly she fumbled into a bent over posture, looking more like an eighty year old woman than herself. She half stumbled and half fell down the stairs to the bathroom. Her face appeared grey in the mirror. The skin under her eyes was blue-black and bruised looking. Bloodshot eyes peered from under lids that wouldn't climb past half open.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A long hot shower allowed her to straighten up and repaired a bit of the exhaustion damage to her face. She turned toward the kitchen but the thought of food brought burning nausea. She climbed slowly back to her bedroom, donned a flight suit, and headed out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Temple Heath was already bustling with activity when she pushed her way through the door. She had just eased herself into the pit to continue the traction motor project from the day before when Bart strode up. One look at her face and his smile dissolved into concern. "Are you sure you want to be here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. It's better than being alone right now." Her voice was still raw and hoarse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anything you feel like talking about?" Bart asked as he sat down at the edge of the pit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I was talking to Ennui and Dementia last night..." she trailed off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good people, those two."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah..." she smiled faintly. "It's the same. So many changes that I don't know what to do with. I need to think about some of them, but when I do, it makes me crazy." She hadn't even noticed she had started pacing. "And so much energy. Its burning up my nerves. I can't stop moving for long. Last night I couldn't sleep until I was so exhausted I couldn't stand. Yet the sun woke me this morning. In a few minutes I'll probably run from here and out into the yard because I won't be able to just be still."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Adaptation reaction..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, that's what Ennui said. Last night I danced until I fell to the floor and couldn't get up again. And still I wanted to keep moving. How long does this go on?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It just depends. For some, it ends quickly, for others, months. Erick for example was months while mine was a couple of weeks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Great, I am so comforted," Kali replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At least you aren't being a total bitch to everyone around you. It's easier to know that you'll go dance in the yard when it gets bad, rather than wondering when you'll scream obscenities at someone again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"More than once I'm afraid." Kali had stopped pacing and had sunk down on her haunches. She had her head leaned against the side of the pit. "Are you sure you don't want to go sleep?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can't," she muttered as she looked away from him. "Nightmares," she whispered. Slowly she pushed herself erect. "I'm ok. I'd like to get back to fixing this now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart looked at her as she resolutely picked up her tools. "Ok, but let me know if you need anything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned haunted eyes back to him, "I will. Thank you."</p>

<br/>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, are you there? We're off to get lunch. You want to come?" Bart's voice slowly penetrated the fog around her. Slowly her head rose from the wires she had been staring at for a very long time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I think so." She fell in with the rest of the lunch crowd. For once she wasn't part of the chattering, playful group. Instead she trudged along behind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The small diner was located just outside the Temple Heath yards. Inside the table tops and counter were worn through in spots from years of polishing and cleaning. The smell of fryer grease, coffee, and onions lay beneath the fresher aromas of the daily specials. As a block they filed over to the large booth in the back and shuffled in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lilly, the usual waitress, came over with a first round of coffees and water. Without a word she slid them in front of the regulars. "What'll it be today? The usuals?" Almost everyone nodded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali almost didn't speak fast enough. Lilly had already started to turn away. "Not today. I'd like the Sunrise burger with everything please. Medium, fried onions, with the bacon and blue cheese. Hash browns with hot sauce and catsup, salad with honey mustard. Thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lilly, eyes twinkling, asked, "Need any mustard or mayo? Thought you got it all, didn't you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali grinned up at her, "Closer than I've ever gotten before. Mustard and mayo would be great, and a large battery acid."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, so part of the usual then, the bottomless glass of grapefruit juice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, unless you want to bring a pitcher?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll just keep it full like always."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In short order the food started to arrive. Kali's plate was one of the last. She dug in immediately. The warm food filled the empty void left from little sleep and less food. She was just finishing the potatoes when a strange warbling chirp sounded near the table. It took her several moments to realize it was coming from her pocket. She hauled the com from Anastasia out of her pocket and shoved the headset over her ear. "Yes?"</p>

<a NAME="shredded"></a>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is Anastasia. You ready to go out? We have a call."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali hesitated for a moment before replying, "Yes. I am near Temple Heath. Should I come to Central Station?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you cross the bridge and head down the platform 10 siding we can pick you up along there. That way you won't have to come all the way in to the station if we get started before you arrive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know how long the mission is?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Twelve hours at the most. The original mission was supposed to run for 18 hours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali shut off the com and turned to Bart. "That was quick. An extraction call already."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Conversations started around the table as the surprise settled in. Bart's question cut over the top of the others, "Are you sure you want to take this one?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali hesitated, uncertain herself, before answering, "Yes, I do." She rose before her fears could root her in place. "I'll be back in tomorrow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Bart's eyes followed her as she turned to go. She almost didn't hear his mumbled, "Be careful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The train picked her up just after she passed the platform ten switch. Anastasia showed her in to the rest of the group where they were scattered in a lounge section of the meeting car. She rattled off the names of the other seven team members. Alisha was her unofficial second, Lauren was a battle mage, Lissa was a mage in training, Natalya handled explosives and other demolition duties, Anton and Mark were fighters, and Danny was the medic. They greeted Kali warmly and mentioned having already heard about her previous mission.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alisha began going over the routine they followed when on an extraction. Kali tried to listen, but kept drifting in and out from lack of sleep. After the fourth time she stopped Alisha with, "I'm sorry. I didn't sleep well and I'm missing what you are telling me. Could I maybe nap till Portal Station and then we can try again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alisha tried to cover her annoyance and replied as calmly as possible, "Ok, but this is important."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And that is why I'd like to give it more attention than I am able to this moment." Kali leaned back and let her eyes droop closed. Sleep did not come, but neither did full wakefulness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was still drifting when the train slowed to a stop at Portal Station. Anastasia and Alisha went in to Dispatch for the latest data on the mission. Once they returned Anastasia spread maps and papers out on a large table. She motioned everyone to gather around and began detailing the situation. "This was a twelve hour mission. We have the fastest routing so we should be arriving in about an hour and a half. The world is not being destroyed, only the section where the team went in. There are four target areas and..." Kali drifted back out as Anastasia continued the briefing. The last image she saw was the main map in the center of the table. It shifted and morphed into a three dimensional modeling as she faded out. She scanned it as her view pulled back to see more of the area. To one side was a tiny train, pulled up neatly on a stretch of track. Tiny figures moved along the roads and paths, splitting into groups and scattering throughout the city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Underneath a building near the train a red point blossomed. Anastasia's voice cut through and it faded rapidly. "Kali, did you have any questions?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Without hearing Kali laid a finger on the map and said, "They will come through here." She looked up to see everyone staring at her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you hear anything I said?" Anastasia asked. She put her own finger on the map at a place farther away. "All our experience shows they will come through here. Near the main group."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, they will come through here," Kali responded, tapping her location. "This gets them in between the train and the teams. They can cut off their escape and kill them as they return."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do you know that?" Alisha asked with thinly veiled antagonism.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's what I would do. Separate them, attack from full advantage, and leave no survivors." Danny hissed in surprise while the rest of the crew stared at her, shock and unease visible on their faces.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's not how the opposition behaves."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They will this time," Kali replied with conviction.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Alisha drew breath to speak when Anastasia overrode her. "Alisha, take the team and head for where we expect the attack. Kali and I will be along in a moment." She waited until the rest of the team was out the door before rounding on Kali. "What did I tell you? Follow along and see how we work. What do you think you are doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They will come through here. I am certain. Look, I will go there. If I'm wrong, call me when the attack happens. If I call you, please come and help." Kali stood and started toward the exit.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you are wrong, I expect you to follow the team from now on."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If I am wrong, I will." Kali strode off the train and into the drizzle. It clung to her hair and dripped down her flight suit. Distant sirens echoed through the dimly lit streets, echoing off the dark, empty buildings towering over her, scraping the leaden sky. She vaguely remembered Anastasia saying this section of the city was going to be hit with an earthquake an hour after the regular mission was scheduled to finish. For a moment she breathed in the empty sadness before hurrying to the building she had seen and stepping inside. It was a lower building, reduced mostly to rubble by an early quake. She carefully picked her way across rain slicked debris and crept to a set of shattered stairs. Slowly she eased her way down them into the dark basement below. The air was cold and damp. Fallen places in the floor above provided patches of light and pools to avoid. She slipped along until she came to the opening she had seen, where the foundation had slumped away into a dark pit. There was no sound except for the dripping of rain from above.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, how are you doing?" Anastasia's voice called from the com.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am in place and waiting. Any sign at your location yet?" Kali shivered slightly in the shadows, cold now that she was no longer moving.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. The data from Dispatch indicates any time now though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A faint popping sound drifted up from the pit in front of Kali. Dim reddish light flickered in the distance, then settled into a dim glowing disk. Grey figures boiled out. "They're here. Do you have any there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How many?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ten so far and more coming through a gate of some kind."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We're coming. Fall back and wait."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As Kali watched more figures piled out of the gate as the first ones slid silently across the pit toward the slope up to her. In her mind she saw the maps again. If they reached the surface there was no good place to hold them back. "Anastasia, pull the recovery missions back to the train. I can't wait. If they get out of here, there is no place to hold them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, you wait!" Anastasia commanded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali waited until the first wave was just starting their climb up to her, then she launched herself into the foe.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, no!" Anastasia screamed when the sounds of fighting reached her. Kali vaguely heard her calling orders to the others as she ripped into the first creatures. Claws raked and swiped past her. Everything contracted down as she danced into the opposition.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several blocks away Anastasia issued rapid orders to the rest of the team. Alisha, Lissa, Anton, and Mark hurried to round up the rescue teams. Anastasia, Lauren, Natalya, and Danny ran back toward Kali's location. They stumbled across the debris and hurried down the steps. Sounds of battle reached them as they neared the break in the foundations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Down in the pit Kali swirled in a mad dance among the grey beings. Lauren fired a light spell into the ceiling. White light poured down over a scene of chaos. Claws raked and whistled past Kali's moving form. Numbers allowed several to land blows, leaving tracks of red and torn cloth in their wake. Strips of her torn boiler suit began to tangle in her movements. A quick twist gained her enough space to slash the top fragments loose from the bottom. She flung the shredded remains from her and into a tangle of attacking forms. They dropped back long enough for her to claw the bottom parts away from her legs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lauren started dropping ones on the edge with her magic while Anastasia rushed forward to help Kali. When she got closer she saw Kali spin and rip the last remains of her boiler suit from her body. She danced on in only a black thong, sports bra, and her heavy leather boots. Bluish ichor and bits of grey flesh clung to her. Here and there splashes of red revealed slashes and cuts. Muscles rippled and flowed in hypnotic fluid motion under her tanned skin. Her feet danced from stone rubble onto dead grey things and back to the stone without her even noticing. The grey things fought with claws and long knives. Kali fought with her hands and feet. Heavy boots crushed skulls and curved talon-like hands ripped oozing chunks from them. Her hair flew loose in a wild curtain behind her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stifled a scream as one being grabbled the flying bundle of Kali's hair. Kali spun with the pull and dropped the creature without a sign of discomfort. When she saw Anastasia she smiled a terrible smile and waved her on. Her voice drifted through the screams, clear and warm, "Come, dance with me. There is plenty for all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lauren eased around until she could see the pulsing red mouth of the gate. Swiftly she worked on a counter spell. A grey being ran for her, sensing her intent. Natalya swung her rifle up and rapidly pumped several rounds into it. It dropped at Lauren's feet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Moments later her spell sped into the gate and snapped it closed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia fought on the edges, accounting for a small number of the remaining foe. Lauren had dropped another small percentage. Kali brought down the rest. By the time she was finished Anastasia was looking on with a mixture of fascination and terror. Kali stood in the center of the carnage, head and arms raised high, mouthing some sort of silent chant. For a flickering instant Anastasia thought she saw something else standing there until Kali dropped her head and arms back down and picked her way carefully over the corpses. She stopped in front of Anastasia and seemed to shiver. Wild energy bled off her, leaving a startled woman looking out through troubled eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui was right, warrior woman," Anastasia whispered softly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So much, so much death," Kali replied softly. Her haunted eyes took in the large pile of corpses. She shivered in the dank building. Her eyes drifted down to take in her appearance. "When did...oh, right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have a spare set of clothes at the train." Anastasia gently took Kali's hand and started to lead her away. Kali followed without protest. The others looked on in surprise as Kali calmly walked past them with no sign of discomfort at her state of undress.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The last of the battle frenzy and adrenaline faded as Kali followed Anastasia through the rain. Greyish blue ichor mixed with oozing red to form slow rivers of purple across Kali's skin. Cold slowly seeped in to replace the heat from the battle. Fatigue caused the images of the buildings around her to waver and shimmer. For a moment she saw flickering lights, slowly moving figures, and scattered vehicles moving along the road.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A looming dark building to her left caught her eye. With a quick twist she pulled away from Anastasia and jogged toward the dark doors. "Kali, wait!" Anastasia yelled. Kali kept going, nimbly dodging through a group of recovery workers hurrying for their train. Just before she reached the doors she spun and jumped. Her feet slammed into the glass, shattering it with a crash. She slipped into the deeper darkness within while Anastasia ran to catch up. Her light played over the interior as Kali strode toward a desk at the back of the entry.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time Anastasia stepped through the broken door Kali was at the far end of the room, scanning the wall behind the security desk. She was muttering as she moved her hands over the panels until she stopped at one. "In here. We need to go down." Her voice took on an odd, disconnected quality as she continued, "It's here...what they wanted. We were...secondary. We need to get down there quickly!" Her hands started scrabbling at the wall, as if she could claw her way through by force of will alone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Natalya, explosives. I need you in the large brooding building near our train. I'm flashing my light toward the street. Anyone else close, we need recovery tools, stat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Natalya jogged up and spread out her equipment. "What is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali placed her hands against the wall. "Through here. There is a shaft. I need into it." Natalya looked at Anastasia. She hesitated a moment, then nodded in agreement. Silently Natalya started placing explosives.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone back. Fire in the hole." They ducked behind the desk as the shaped charges did their work. Kali bent and pulled the buckles loose on her boots, kicked them off, and darted through the dust to the hole. "Light." Mark tossed her a high power head lamp as he raced into the building. "Bring equipment, quickly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali twisted into the shaft and began climbing down. Her hands and feet grabbed rebar, old form wires, and other bits and pieces as she climbed down. Anastasia rushed forward and shoved her head through the opening. Kali was already twenty feet below her and still headed down. "Mark, get a rope in place. You and I are following her down. Kali," she called into the com.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Will we need explosives?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Natalya, you come too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali passed fifty feet and kept descending. Her hands and feet started to cramp. At eighty feet her arms were trembling and her vision blurred. At ninety feet she stopped and edged over to a heavy door. Using her clawed nails she carefully worked the pins loose from the opening mechanism. The rope dropped down behind her as she struggled to open the doors. Slowly they edged open.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia was half way down when she saw Kali roll forward into a corridor. She swarmed down the rope as quickly as she could. The corridor stretched off empty in front of her. She flashed her light around, finding only Kali's bloody foot prints running down the corridor and turning left at the first opportunity.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Running now, Anastasia spun around the corner and followed the tracks deeper into the basements. She passed several shredded grey bodies as she followed Kali's trail deeper down the cold, white corridors. No doors marred the walls. Far ahead a soft glow of light came from a passage to the right. At the end of it Kali was carefully feeling around the edges of a large vault door. She spun as Anastasia ran up. "Tools, I need tools. We haven't much time. Whatever the opposition wanted, it's in here!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The others are right behind me. Are you ok?" Anastasia took in the slowly widening blood smears under Kali's feet. Her wounds still oozed blood and she was shivering slightly in the cold.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," she answered, distracted, as she turned back to the door. "Here, this is where we pry." Her fingers curled slightly into a faint lip at the edge of the door. "Bar," she called as Mark came around the corner. He once again soundlessly tossed her the requested item. Kali shoved it into the faint crack and pushed. She shook as fatigued muscles refused to give her any power. "Help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mark threw his weight against the bar. It began to edge outward as Anastasia added her strength. Natalya took a second bar and added her effort. The door eased out slowly. Revealed in the widening opening was a crushed body. It had wedged between the door and the locking system, preventing the last security measures from sealing down the large lab space behind it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali darted into the opening, sketching a slight bow to the corpse, and softly saying, "Thank you." She reverently stepped over the remains and into the large space. Strange equipment lined the walls and littered long benches. Moving in trance-like slow motion she pivoted slowly and started toward the bench farthest from the door. "These are what we want."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia looked down at the oddly shaped rifle like devices Kali was pointing at. Six of them lay in a neat row on the bench top. "Mark, Natalya, grab these."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still moving in slow motion Kali stepped over to a bulky object on another work surface. She pulled it to her and picked it up. "This too. It contains data. We need to damage this equipment before we go." Her eyes grew distant, "The second wave is coming soon. They want this very badly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nat, charges, now," Anastasia commanded. "Mark, you get going with those. Anton, where are you?" Natalya began pulling small blocks of explosives from her pack. Swiftly she began setting them around the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Near a shaft in the building Mark ran into," his voice came through filled with static.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anyone with you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lissa and Alisha aren't too far away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bring Lissa with you. Come on down the rope. We need your help. Follow the bloody footprints until you find us. Kali, lets go. Nat, how're you doing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bloody footprints?" Anton asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't ask. Just hurry."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Another five minutes." Natalya had scattered blocks of explosives strategically around the room. She was inserting detonators and connecting wires as she replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anton and Lissa hurried in a moment later. "Here," Anastasia said. "Grab some of those weird weapons from Mark and start back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali pushed the strange box toward Anastasia. "Take this. Mark, a weapon please." She caught the weapon as it flew toward her. She spun to face a the far corner of the room. "Natalya, they're almost here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, ok, just two more connections." Her fingers flew as she twisted and pulled at the connections. She stood quickly and pulled a small item from her pocket. She twisted the mass of wires onto two terminals, flipped a small switch, then set it carefully on the floor. "I'm ready, let's go!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Go, run! I'll be right behind you. Natalya, detonate when you reach the shaft." Kali yelled as she slowly backed toward the door. Anastasia stopped for a moment until Kali glared at her, then she turned and ran for the door. In the hallway the rest of the team was already rounding the first corner.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stopped at the rope and turned to look for Kali. She slid around the corner just as a deep whump sounded from behind her. The pressure wave from the explosion threw her forward into the floor. The strange weapon flew from her hands, clattered across the floor, and skidded to a stop a couple of feet from Anastasia.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia ran back and hauled Kali upright. Her skin was icy to the touch and her eyes were glazed. "I've got you. Let's go." She pulled her along, stopping only long enough to grab the weapon. "Anton, Mark, I'm tying Kali on the rope. Pull her up at my signal. Lissa, drop me another rope." Her hands swiftly tied Kali into a harness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stas, tie yourself on as well. We have enough people up here to pull both of you up and you can keep Kali from bumping the walls." Anastasia quickly complied and sent the message. She crawled up the wall as they were pulled up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Boots," Kali mumbled as Anastasia half carried her toward the exit from the building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Someone, grab the boots by the desk," Anastasia called back. "Allen, be ready to leave when we get to the train. Did the rescue mission leave yet?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes the other train left already. I am ready as soon as you are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia  led Kali directly to the sleeper car and to the shower. She spun the water on, adjusted it to barely warm, and pushed Kali into it. She slid down the small space until she was almost sitting on the floor of it. Her frame was just a bit too long so she ended up wedged in. "Rinse off. I'll be right back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali sat half conscious under the water. The stinging pain of water on new cuts and scratches, dull, throbbing pain from over worked muscles and joints, and shooting pain from the bruises and cuts on her feet brought her slowly back to awareness. She fumbled around, trying to rise and get the worst of the mess off herself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia returned with large towels and a heavy blanket. She helped Kali stand and pulled the last of her clothing off. She gently patted her dry and started to wrap the blanket around her. "No, I'm still bleeding."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It will wash out. You need to get warm." Anastasia wrapped the blanket tightly around Kali and held her close. Carefully she walked them back to her compartment, eased Kali back onto the bed and activated several emergency heat packs. She placed them around Kali and then covered her with a second blanket. Kali gradually stopped shaking as warmth seeped in slowly, easing the reaction and the chill. Her eyes drifted closed. "Danny, could you come to my room with your med gear? Kali needs looking after. Allen, take us out of here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm on my way." Danny replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are out of here," Allen answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you for showing me a wonderful time," Kali whispered through a soft smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stared at her, wondering what Kali had meant with the strange statement. She looked up as Lauren entered and asked, "How is she? That was incredible, what she did. I had heard the stories, but, wow..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I know. I wonder what price she pays though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The price who pays?" Danny asked as he entered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali," Anastasia answered. "She's naked under there, just so you know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He settled down near the bed. "Thanks for the warning. Kali, I'm going to look at your injuries now, if that's ok?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok," she answered quietly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny pulled the blanket back in sections, working on small areas of exposed skin at all times. He applied bandages and butterfly strips as needed. When he saw her feet he hissed in surprise. "She was walking on these?" Anastasia nodded silently. "Ouch!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That bad?" Kali asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should stay off your feet for a few days."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That bad?" she asked again, a little more forcefully.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You cut the shit out of them, so yes, I'm afraid so. What did you do, walk through broken glass?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Among other things, yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really? Or are you just being a brat?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really." She flashed him a wicked grin. Then her eyes drooped again. Exhaustion masked the pain from the claw marks on her back and sides enough for sleep to almost win.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, everyone out. My patient needs some rest." Danny backed slowly out of the room and closed the door behind him. Kali slid down into sleep.</p>
