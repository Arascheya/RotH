<p class="pagecaption">Charlotte - Tales of Dementia</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">/* need to conform personal timeline - remember her daughter and add visions */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* also remember - while Willem is in the power elite, he is not the only power elite. as his policies effect the rest there will be push-back and attempts to curb his changes. some of the players will use any means at their disposal - Valen could certainly help him understand what he is encountering */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* also remember London Weather - fogs, cold, etc. need to get the atmosphere of the place */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I am sitting here in the Hall of Records, staring out the enormous windows of the main library. Bright summer sun highlights Central Station to the right and the Cathedral of All Faiths to the left. A, new to me, laptop sits on the table in front of me and I will soon return to staring into its screen. Ennui has inspired me with her chronicling of her adventures in Eternia. It is time to set down my experiences, not of the times here in Eternia, but back in the Realms, back in the world that was so similar to the one of Ennui, but wildly different as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My name is Dementia, a name that fits the state of my being more than my birth name. Through the course of this narrative you may come to understand this truth as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was born Charlotte Lousie Collins in London, England on the 23rd day of May in the year of 1866 by our reckoning. My family was already involved in theatre and I was no exception. In 1877 I started on stage as a skipping rope dancer. When I was a little older I joined my sisters, Lizzie and Marie, in my first music hall acts. My family was good enough that we were reasonably paid. We never wanted for food or housing, however we couldn't afford many luxuries either.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I should say up front that my Realm was different from that of Ennui. The march of industrialism surged with even greater fervor in my Realm, reducing the role of the monarchy and giving rise to wealthy industrialists.. In the Realm of Ennui the nobility and the royal family held far more power much later into the 1890s. The political situation on the continent was less strained in my world than Enui's as well. The industrialists conspired with each other to reduce the power of nations and reduce war. While they could make money with war, the cross-border trade in goods was more profitable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The world was a rapidly changing whirl of events and situations, however, I ignored most of it. Although, there were things that did make an impression. The Whitechapel killings in 1888 for one. Many of us were afraid to walk the night during that time. It made me nervous for years since there never was an official solution to the case. In general, though, I was insulated in my world of music hall and theatre work. I probably would have remained that way were it not for a strange series of circumstances that started in late 1894, when I was booked back into the Gaiety Theatre.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">London was a city in collision. The nobility still clung to the power hierarchy that had been built over centuries. The new merchant principles were allowing even common people to accumulate vast wealth and threatened to depose the nobility. In this chaos Lord Willem Wellingham provided a shining example. He was nobility by birth, however, he was also a businessman of impressive skill. In a very short amount of time he had taken a few investments from his father and turned them into an industrial empire without rival. His holdings included most major British rail systems and the famed Oriental Express system of the continent. He was also a noted philanthropist and advocate of worker benefits.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The night started like any other. The performance was well received and afterward I was in my dressing room changing back into my regular wear. The usual crowd of attention seekers were outside my door, clamoring for a glimpse and maybe a signature on their programs, when one of the stage hands pushed his way through. "Miss Collins, there are a couple of ladies to see you." He stepped aside and motioned two women forward. Ladies they were, dressed in the latest fashions of the nobility. The one in the lead looked vaguely familiar, but I couldn't remember from where.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Miss Collins, good evening. I am Lucy Wellingham and this is my friend Mina Murray." Now I remembered her. Lucy Wellingham, working woman, socialite, and bane to many of the 'proper' noble families of the time. Lucy went where she wanted, did as she liked, and showed little respect for the traditions of the time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pleased to meet you ladies," I replied as I dropped a deep curtsy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please, no need for that foolishness." Lucy reached out and pulled me back up. "May we sit?" I nodded and motioned them to my chair and the guest chair. "My father, Willem, sends his regards as well. We enjoyed the performance this evening and were wondering what sort of donation would be acceptable to you as a sign of our patronage."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You should be talking with the proprietor."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No," Mina replied. "The patronage is for you, not for any facility you may be performing in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stared for long moments from shock. "I, I thank you. A few pounds, I guess."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lucy rolled her eyes. "Do not be rediculous. This is to be a yearly stipend to cover your basic expenses. My father and I were thinking around 800 pounds a year. If that is too low, we can always go higher."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My mouth opened and closed several times, although no speach was possible. I was well compensated as a performer, however, with the vagaries of performance schedules I rarely made half of that in any given year. "That would be simply wonderful."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good. It's settled then. There is one catch." My heart sank. There was always a catch. "You must come with us to lunch at the Alexandra Club tomorrow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Alexandra? I would be horribly out of place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. Well, perhaps a bit because of the stiff membership fee."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you want me to come?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lucy's giving a presentation on employment and the role of women. Most of the members think only of the less desirable positions available. We will represent the falacy in that viewpoint," Mina replied</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not sure my position will be seen as a 'better' one than the associations those women may have."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nonsense," Lucy commented. "Your position requires skill and talent as much as what Mina and I do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry, but I don't know what the two of you do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mina is in charge of the financial side of International Computing Machines and I am in charge of the engineering development."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After more dicussion I gave in and agreed to go with them. They arranged to meet me near the club at eleven thirty. Once they were gone I sat and stared at the mirror for a long time. Finally I rose, made my way outside after signing a few programs for the few people still in the hallway, and hailed a cab. Back at my tiny home I fell into bed.</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">The next day I stood nervously near the Alexandra Club entrance. I was dressed in the finest things I had. They were proper for a performer of my station and stature, but I doubted they were suitable for the company I was about to keep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lucy and Mina arrived a few minutes later. They were dressed in simple working women's clothes. I saw them before they saw me. For a breif moment I considered slipping away. Then Mina caught sight of me, raised her hand, and waved me over. Together we walked up to the front door and entered. The doorman bowed defferencially to Mina and Lucy, and looked me over. "Miss Wellingham, Miss Murray, and ... guest."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes George. Please announce our guest as Miss Collins."</p>
