<p class="pagecaption">Anastasia - Chapter 1</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia slowly woke to the rocking and clacking of the train's motion. "Mother? Where are we going?" She murmured softly, eyes still closed. As her drowsiness faded she opened her eyes on unexpected face. The woman was dressed as a proper British Lady, similar to some of the ones that used to come to court. She was seated near the bed, watching Anastasia as she stirred.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, you awaken. You had me worried for a moment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia's eyes darted about, taking in the rich hangings and dimly lit air of the small compartment. The woman was speaking to her in flawless Russian with just the faintest tinge of a British accent. Uncertainty rose rapidly as Anastasia struggled to remember why she might be on a train and sleeping. Dim, dark memories surged just below her awareness. "Who are you and what is going on?" A tinge of near hysteria leaked threw around the words.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My name is Charlotte and you are in a safe place. What do you remember?" The woman replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What should I remember? What do you mean safe place? What Is Going On?!?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't remember anything then? You were in an...accident. I was nearby and stopped to help you. You are aboard my private rail car."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't remember anything. Where is my family? Have you contacted them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm afraid not. I can't really do that without knowing who you are now can I?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am...I..." Her face clouded up as she struggled to remember her name. "What has happened? Please, tell me!" Her eyes grew calculating as she saw a small look of worry cross Charlotte's face. "There's something you aren't telling me, isn't there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I'm afraid there is." Charlotte drew a deep breathe, paused, then said slowly, "Your name I believe to be Anastasia. You were killed in an unfortunate series of events." She held up her hand as Anastasia drew breath to speak. "Wait please. Let me try and finish. What I said is true. You are safe here. You do need to make a choice though. One that you probably aren't ready to make."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What...what choice?" Anastasia choked out through a suddenly paralyzed throat. Icy panic crawled up her back as she remembered all the skipped confessions and the thoughts about boys. Dark memories crept closer as well. Screams, shots, flaring candles. Terror curled through the dark in foggy tendrils. "Not hell, please, not hell. I can hear the screams..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That isn't for me to decide. The offer I am allowed to make is only this. You may come with me and step away from the beliefs of your world or accept the beliefs of your up-bringing and whatever they say will befall you. If you accept my offer you will join the ranks of a place called Eternia. You will help in the saving of the beauty of the Realms until such time as you fall or move on."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fall? Move on? Eternia? Get behind me, Satan." Anastasia struggled to sit up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a brief moment Charlotte looked surprised, then she burst out laughing. "I'm sorry, that wasn't very proper. You just startled me. I am no devil or demon. I am no angel or saint either. I am only a humble messenger with an offer from the Lady of Eternia. She is beyond the pettiness of the godlings that preach heaven, hell, Satan, and all the rest of that nonsense." Gently she pushed Anastasia back onto the bed. "You've had a bad shock. You'll be up and moving soon, but it's better not to push too hard."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let me go!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If that is what you truly want, I will. Just rest a few minutes more and I'll take you back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Back?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wasn't safe to remain where you were killed. I had to move, but I can take you back. Just be sure that is what you want because once you step off this train I can make no other offers. If you are worried about hell you might want to think about this quite carefully." She smiled slightly, "Personally, I find great comfort in being able to side-step the religion of my past. I did a lot of things that were quite questionable and not having to worry does bring a delightful sense of peace."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You did? What, if I might ask?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You may ask," Charlotte replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia laughed as she said, "But you are not going to tell me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Possibly, but first you need to make your decision."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How about you tell me and then I decide? It might help me with my choice."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Charlotte responded with an exaggerated frown, "Well, as long as you know, this just is not proper." Her teasing smile took any sting out of the words. "I had sex out of marriage, for fun, profit, and to acquire positions. I have stolen food when I was hungry. I have lusted in my heart after women and men, and acted on a few of those cases. I have not killed anybody, however. Oh, and I am a witch. At least I would be called one for the visions I sometimes get. They did help for the small time I made a living giving card readings to the fancy ladies of London."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia eyed her speculatively. "But you look the proper lady now. You were not noble born then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Charlotte laughed again. "No. I hope that does not cause you difficulty. Where we are going birth rank is not important. Only what you do determines how you are regarded. That point does cause trouble for some. Are you one of them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I," Anastasia paused, "I am not certain. I have no memory that would help me know. Are you able to tell me anything of my past?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am not allowed by the rules of Eternia. If your past is important to you, you will need to remember it for yourself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is this normal, to forget like this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not always. It does seem to be most common when severe trauma has occurred. I do not wish to anger you, however, you must give me a decision. Soon the godlings will send someone to collect you. If you have not decided by then I must let them take you. Then you will be bound by the beliefs of your past, even if you no longer remember all of them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia hesitated before slowly saying, "I accept your offer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you do so willingly?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I accept willingly and without pressure or persuasion."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome to the Death City Metro and to Eternia, Anastasia." Charlotte pulled open a drawer on the small table next to the bed. She picked up an oddly shaped bit of dark material and spoke at it. "We may be on our way. Anastasia has accepted our offer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A voice replied from within it, startling Anastasia. "Excellent. Arrival at the Portal will be in three hours." The sounds of the rails changed slightly, as if the train had passed onto a different stretch of track.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where did that voice come from? What's in that box?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is a form of the magic from Eternia. It is called a 'com' and I am told it comes from a dead world. It was regarded as an every day item there apparently. It allows me to speak with the driver of the train."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia slowly lifted herself to a sitting position in the bed and reached for the drawn curtains. "Where are we now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You might not want to do that, unless you want another shock." Charlotte said quietly. Anastasia shot her an angry look and whipped the curtains aside. A small shriek escaped her as she stared into the darkness beyond. Stars sprinkled the Void around the hurtling train. White and shaking she dropped back down on the bed. "I did try and tell you. We are in the lands of magic now. Nothing is quite as it was in the Realms. In three hours you will see one of the greater forms of magic. It is the Portal into Eternia from the area of the Realms." She held up her hand as Anastasia started to speak. "Please, do not ask me what that means. I can say the words but I have no understanding of this either. In the time I have been in Eternia I have learned the only way to not become deranged is to accept even the things which seem impossible. Sometimes understanding will come after time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What...what is that outside?" The hysteria was back with more force this time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is what is between the Realms. It is called 'Void' or 'space' or 'aether'. We travel across it to get to the various places where we will be working. We collect things when they would otherwise be destroyed. Then we will slip them back into the various Realms where they can continue to be appreciated. We are often the reason you can find that perfect item in the back corner of a small shop somewhere. Something that no one remembered was there." Anastasia was still white and shivering slightly. "I know you probably will not be able to, but you should try and sleep some more." Charlotte bit her lip and added slowly, "Your death was not easy or clean. Your spirit is going to need some time to recover, even if you do not consciously remember. I know some soothing songs if that would help you to sleep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes mother, please sing to me," Anastasia replied with just a hint of sarcasm. Charlotte began singing softly. Within moments Anastasia's eyes drifted closed and her breathing evened out into sleep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The nightmares started almost immediately. Shadowy figures moved just beyond the lamp light in a dark, dank cellar. Heavy boots thumped on the upper floor and muffled curses drifted down the stairs. Wispy figures stood next to her. She tried to turn and see who was next to her but a tall shadow figure held her fast. She struggled, trying to get loose, trying to run to a tall shape nearby.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia jerked upright as a raw scream split the air. "Ah, no, no, Mother!" Sightless eyes darted around the room, not really seeing anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anastasia, wake up, wake up. You are safe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At last the eyes settled onto Charlotte's face and some of the tension drained from the young woman. "Sleep does not seem to be something I can do right now. If you cannot speak about my past, maybe you could tell me a bit about your own?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I will, but there is not much to tell. I was born in London to a family of performers. I was the youngest of three sisters. My parents had a small act in one of the middle class theatres at the time where we would help with various small things. I first performed when I was eleven in a rope jumping skit with my sisters. As I grew older I managed to get and keep work through various methods for most of my early adulthood. I scratched and scraped for many years until I slept my way into a break. After that it got easier. There is very little of interest in my life."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I doubt that. Being in London in the late 1800's would have to have been more interesting than you are making it. What did you do? Did you see Jack the Ripper?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"See Jack the Ripper? No, and I never want to! That was a horrible time. Many of us were afraid to walk the streets at night."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But it had to be exciting besides, did it not? I think I was kept at home or not allowed to see much. I think I was surrounded with expectations and rules that I did not understand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Exciting? It might have been, if it were possible to ignore the ever present fear. I did not really get over it until I traveled to America for a while in 1891."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"America? Land of decadence and ill repute? What was it like?" Anastasia's eyes shone with curiosity and hunger.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was interesting. I learned a couple of things to bring back and enhance my reputation. Otherwise I was in the large cities, so it was like London in many ways. From what I saw, London was easily as decadent in many ways as the places in America." Charlotte thought for a few minutes. "The most excitement I remember was in 1895. Through a strange series of events I had come to know Lord Willem Wellingham, the magnate behind International Transport Consortium, a huge group of related companies that have tendrils into most of Western Europe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have heard of this company. It runs the Trans Siberian railroad under license from the Tsar of Imperial Russia. A ruthless but honorable man I am told."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You remember something! Is there anything else?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a moment the dark shapes flitted across the edges of Anastasia's memory and then withdrew. "No, not really," she replied with a soft sigh. "So you know Lord Willem. What is he really like? Did you meet his daughter? I admire her. I wish I could have had her opportunities."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am not sure you would. In the summer of 1895 there were several very strange events. The biggest one was the disappearance of the entire Wellingham household for several days. The servants covered as well as they could, however, by the third day gossip throughout the city reported that the family could not be located. Those of us that were friends were not able to contact them either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you ever find out what happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not completely, but I was able to find out a little bit about it. It all started with a new group of acquaintances that entered the scene. I am trying to remember exactly what happened. It was twenty-two years ago and I have experienced quite a bit since then."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lucy Wellingham was still single and having many parties to search for eligible suitors. Mina Harker, her friend has just had her husband disappear in the wilds of Transylvania, and there were rumors of another killer in Whitechapel. Lord Wellingham had made his first contribution to the Alhambra Theatre and his family had started to attend. I had met Lucy, Mina, and Lady Wellingham at one of the benefit events. I think Lucy liked me because I was not proper."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A new killer in Whitechapel, other than the ripper?" Anastasia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. This on left corpses drained of blood. Usually petty criminals and other undesirables. In some ways the police weren't all that interested in finding the perpetrater."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"After the benefit Lucy would come and see me at the theatre during the day. Sometimes she brought her friend Mina along. By that summer we were good friends. Sometimes they would invite me along to the fancy parties they attended. At first I thought it was just to shock the proper people until I realized Lucy and Mina would spend more time with me than with their peers. It was still not an acceptable situation to a great many of the others at the social level of the Wellinghams, but Lord Willem never tried to prevent it. I think he secretly enjoyed annoying the others with his eccentricities."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Near the end of April in 1895 Lucy was having another party. This was the first time I was invited to the Wellingham estates. Mina and Lucy had coached me thoroughly on how to behave in their version of society. I always knew Lucy had a strange sense of humor, but I had never seen it at work as directly as I did that day. They sent a coach to pick me up at my flat near Leicester Square. Dressed in my finest I boarded it and was transported to the St. Pancras railway station. Confused, i was about to ask the driver what was going on, when a footman ushered me out of the cab. He conducted me through a private entrance to the station, through a maze of corridors, and out on a small private platform. Drawn up to the platform was a gleaming rail coach with the Wellingham arms blazoned on it. A small steam locomotive panted softly in the late afternoon sunlight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The footman turned me over to a porter who helped me board the coach and settled me in an enormous arm chair. Silently he pulled a small lace covered table close to my left elbow and placed a crystal flagon of water and a single glass. Next came a vase with a single yellow rose. When he finally spoke it was to ask after my desires for drink and early dinner."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The train left the platform as soon as the porter headed off to fill my desires. Within a few minutes he returned with the food and a fine red wine. Outside the train sped through London to the west and then turned onto a private siding that entered the Wellingham estate. It was an enormous amount of land carved out of the west end of London. There was a small private forest, riding pastures, private stables and signs of wealth and power I had never considered. The train pulled up to a platform at the side of the house where I was greeted by a smiling Lucy and Mina. 'We thought you should experience that at least once in your life,' Mina said as she helped me onto the platform."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Only very special friends of the family get to experience the private train. Welcome!' Lucy added as she pulled me into a close hug. 'Ready for the party?' I could only nod in shock."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside the grand ball room Lord and Lady Wellingham greeted me warmly as well. A large number of the wealthy and powerful of London society were there. 'Come with me, join the recieving line. There are more guests waiting to enter,' Lucy prompted when I started toward the rest of the guests."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Are you sure? I am not family.' I stammered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Of course you are family,' Lucy corrected. Once we were ready Lord Wellingham nodded to the men at the door. They pulled them open and admitted the waiting guests. The names rolled over me in a constant stream until Lucy nudged me. 'Here come my suitors. I want you to tell me what you think of them at the end of the evening. That is one of the reasons I really wanted you here tonight.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The voice of the announcer faded back into my awareness when I started to listen again. 'Dr. Jack Seward, chief resident, West End Asylum for the Insane. Mr....' The announcement stopped as Dr. Seward softly said something to him. Dr. Seward was a sallow, slightly stoop shouldered younger man. He peered out at the world through round rim glasses and hesitated slightly in his movements."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Dr. Seward has brought a guest. Introducing Dr. Henry Jekyll, resident at London Hospital and teaching surgeon from the Royal College of Surgeons.' A slightly older gentleman entered behind Dr. Seward. He smiled warmly and moved with ease into the crowd."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Mr. Quincy Adams, from America.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Isn't he adorable?' Lucy asked. Adams was tall, sun bronzed, and very handsome. He swept his large brimmed tan hat off and made a sweeping bow to the room."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Arthur Holmwood of the Lord Robert Holmwood family.'" Arthur was a typical London socialite. He was extremely well dressed and moved with a proper level of decorum and precision. His smile was friendly, if a bit distracted, and his eyes wnadered aimlessly around sizing up the other guests. Once he finished he moved toward the group he thought would bring the best prestige."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took another half hour for the rest of the guests to be announced. Lucy moved off to mingle while Mina and I went for champaign. I kept a watch on the three suitors, noticing with whom they talked and how often Lucy flirted with each of them. As the evening wore on I noticed Lucy spending more and more time with Dr. Jekyll."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The evening was a success for me as well. I had danced with several of the guests, been chatted up by some of the others, and had several interesting conversations with Lord and Lady Wellingham. As the time neared midnight the guests began to take their leave. I was on my way to ask Lord Wellingham about arrangements to return me to my flat when Lucy cornered me. 'Charlotte, you really must stay the night. We have so many empty rooms in this place. We can stay up late, talk about men, and eat chocolate. Please say you will stay!'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'I would love to stay.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Half an hour later Mina, Lucy, and I were sitting on Lucy's bed and eating expensive Belgian chocolates. We talked about the party, the guests, some of the stranger fashions, and were just starting in on the topic of men. 'Charlotte, what did you think of my three suitors?'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'They were quite handsome and they seemed quite attentive.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'I know that part. I meant what do you think of them as possible husbands.'" Lucy pressed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I tried to keep my answers evasive because I did not like the way any of them treated her. To a man they expressed the desire to protect and coddle her. The Lucy I knew would not last long in such circumstances. Lucy would not accept the evasive answers I gave her and kept asking until I told her my real thoughts."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Thank you, Charlotte. I do not know why you felt you could not say that to me from the start. I agree with you,' she sighed. 'I really was hoping Arthur would prove to be better than that. He has known me from childhood and I have never been one to settle back and be a pampered lady. Oh well, some can not escape their breeding. I had been going to decide on Arthur but your opinions as well as some other events have changed my mind. Mina, what did you think?'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'I have to agree with Charlotte. They all want to possesse you. I think none of them would want you to continue working for your father.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Other events?' I asked."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Yes, the introduction of the delightful Dr. Jekyll. Oh I know he seemed frightfully old by comparison, yet he speaks to me as an equal. Why we had several conversations just this evening about science and medicine. I have tried to speak with dear Jack about this in the past, but he shies away, desiring to preserve my delicate feelings.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We spent the rest of the night gossiping, giggling, and having a wonderful time. In the morning there was a supremely decadent breakfast. Then Lucy and Mina accompanied me on the train back to London. They headed off to ITC while a cab returned me to my flat. It seemed small and shaby compared to the places I had been the following night."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The next time I saw the entire family was at the grand opening of the Imhotep Exhibit at the British Museum. Some of us had been hired to provide a bit of entertainment at the banquet. It was all high class items and a bit different from our usual routines, however we were well paid. The Wellinghams were sitting with several people I had not seen before. Have you ever had the situation where you see someone and they make an immediate impression? That was the people with the Wellinghams. There were three of them. A dark haired, dark skinned woman who watched everything. I had seen that look in battle hardened soldiers but never in the face of a woman. At the time I thought she might have been Egyptian or maybe gypsy, later I was not as sure. The second one was dressed simply but carried herself with a sense of presence that would have made the Queen herself stop and bow. She had an aura of such intense power and control that you could see the servants change posture and attitude as they approached her. The last woman was the most memorable. She was rail thin and dressed like the others, yet there was some undefinable wrongness about her. Her eyes were often distant and empty. When she spoke it was in broken sentences and in a clipped jerky manner, like she never really learned to speak. She radiated menace in some way. The servants would barely approach her and everyone except her companions stayed as far away from her as they could."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"After the banquet the assemblage rose to view the new exhibit. The three women moved like predatory cats. Have you ever been to a large animal park and watched lions or tigers pace? These women moved in that way. Sinister and predatory with almost impossible grace. There was a step on the way to the exhibit hall that was incorrectly set. Almost everyone stumbled slightly on it. Those three glided over it as if it was not even there. I know I am rambling a bit, I just want to impart the entire strangeness of these people."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When Lucy passed near me she waved me over and introduced them. Isabella Valen was the regal one. Letitia Thanatos was the soldier appearing one and the one with the name meaning death I have since learned. Shandi Kayara was the wrong one. They were all polite but distant and their eyes watched everything."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was about to reply when a faint whisper of a vision slipped by. I was not even sure it had happened until Shandi tilted her head, gave me a curious little half smile, and said, 'See later,' before gliding away. The other two looked slightly puzzled as they continued on."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I turned to join my troupe in preparing to leave when Lucy put her hand on my arm and said, 'No, please come with us. I think you will find this interesting. There is some mystery behind this whole exhibit. This find is based on a family legend from a woman named Angelique Marsters. She is a friend of mine. I should bring her to lunch, I think the two of you would like each other. She is not proper either. Her family history says her mother is descended from a handmaiden in the service of Queen Hatshepsut and through this she had information on where the tomb of Imhotep was located. Of course no one believed her at first. About four years ago we started playing a game where she would predict what the latest Egyptologist would find where he was digging. Her success rate was amazing. After the fourth time in a row I asked her to talk to father. She told him what she knew about Imhotep and where he had been buried. Father financed part of the expedition and it was quite successful.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Angelique Marsters was another curiosity of the time. In late 1888 her family was murdered while she was at the theatre with a suitor. When she returned home she found her father, mother and brother all dead in various sections of the house. All the bodies had been drained of blood through two small wounds on their necks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Angelique turned into a recluse. Before the deaths she was a well known socialite. She could be found at the best theatres and social places of the London nobility. After the death of her family she disappeared from view. She closed down the family home and rented a flat on Baker Street. She was rarely seen except at some of the charitable functions she continued in remembrance of her family. Lucy Wellingham and Mina Harker worked constantly to draw her out of hiding. They had little success until the appearance of the three mystery women."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I asked Lucy why Angelique was not at the exhibit. She told me Angelique was not fond of public notice. Too many people still wanted to talk to her about the deaths of her family."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thinking about this so long after the fact I see things now I should have seen then. Like the strange looks Isabella and Letitia shared when Lucy mentioned the strange deaths of Angelique's family."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The exhibit was interesting. It was more complete than many of the ones of the time. It looked like the tomb had been found in tact. I sometimes wish I could return to that Realm and see if I could read the hieroglyphics now. I have learned many languages in Eternia since I arrived. There was one small item, buried in the back, that was extremely odd. I would not have noticed it if Isabella had not seen it first. It looked like a scrap of papyrus that might have belonged to a student scribe. It contained several different sections of what looked like the shorthand hieroglyphics scribes would use in day to day work, at least that is what the information plaque said. What caught our eyes was the very small section that was in an entirely different script."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was just close enough to hear Isabella whisper to Letitia, 'I have seen that script before. And recently too.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Where?'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'While visiting She Who Must Never be Named.' Isabella replied. Letitia looked thoughtful at that news and I felt a chill at the way Isabella had spoken the name."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I had reacted a bit more visibly than I had hoped because I saw Letitia start moving her hands and fingers in an elaborate dance. Isabella did as well. They continued their conversation in some type of finger-speech as they continued through the exhibit. Up ahead I heard a gasp and turned just in time to see it came from Lucy. Isabella and I hurried forward, reaching Lucy in time to see her pointing at a hieroglyphic. 'Angelique has a tattoo that looks exactly like what is painted on the woman kneeling in front of Imhotep.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The com sounded and the driver's voice called, "Portal in five minutes." Charlotte shivered slightly as she was pulled out of her memories. More of them were returning based on her expanded background. New perspectives were sliding into place based on the worlds she had seen and the events that had befallen her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?" Anastasia looked up, startled. "Do I need to do anything for this 'Portal'?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Charlotte focused on her slowly. "No, just be aware of it. Some people notice a strange feeling going through it and it is best if you are ready." Charlotte looked out the window to see if this was one of the approaches that would reveal the Portal in all it's glory. "Anastasia, look out the window and you can see the Portal. Do not look into it directly though. You can lose yourself in it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Portal loomed large and ancient ahead and to the right of them as they approached. A giant oval structure of carved and woven jet black material surrounded a swirling, pulsing field of energy. It was a combination of all colors and no color, roiling and surging in a not quite random pattern. Charlotte found it difficult to heed her own warning as she glanced at the Portal. It sang a siren song of power and understanding, promising to release its secrets if she looked just a few minutes longer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is something terribly compelling about it," Anastasia commented. She was staring into it, starting to slip into a deep trance when Charlotte shook her. "I see what you mean. It promises everything for just a little more time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The secret is to sneak little side looks at it. Quick looks, just enough to see it without becoming too aware of it." A minute later the train swung around as the track swept in to the Portal. A shivery, shimmering, stretching rippled through them as they passed through it and into Eternia. "We are passing Portal Station, which sits just back from the Portal itself. We will pass through a long tunnel, through the Mountains of Chaos and then we will climb down into Eternia proper."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Charlotte finished speaking as they slid into the tunnel. Echoes crashed and built as the sounds of the train were amplified into a thundering wave of sound. It beat down on them, a living thing, trying to flatten them beneath its power. Charlotte reveled in it as the reminder of her new home. Anastasia clamped her hands over her ears and tried to burrow down into the bed. Anything to hide from the aweful, shattering sound.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The waves of sound poured over Anastasia, driving her thoughts back and down into the swirling fog of dim terror. In an instant the images crystallized. Dark figures swarmed into the dank cellar where Anastasia huddled with her family. Rifles were raised and a cascade of shots echoed in small room. Her parents fell instantly. Her sister and brother took a little more time. Bullets thudded and rebounded from the wealth she had sewn into her garments. In frustration one of the men smashed his rifle into her face. Bayonets slashed and tore at her and pain exploded in their wake. Her mouth opened in a silent scream as her overloaded mind finally dropped into darkness.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Wounds began to appear on Anastasia. Her body started to fade as the wounds grew more vivid and angry. "Anastasia," Charlotte called once the train cleared the tunnel. "You are safe. You are safe. Wake up, please." She shook her gently at first, then harder when she didn't respond. Her hands slid into the fading form. "Anastasia!" Charlotte shouted as she slapped Anastasia sharply.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How dare you touch me!" Anastasia shouted. Her body snapped back to solidity and the wounds vanished. "I am the Tsar's daughter." Her face fell as she once more remembered. "They killed us. Our military imprisoned us and our people killed us." Wounds glimmered wetly on her face and neck.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stop. You have to stop thinking so much about your death. You are killing yourself again. Try and step back otherwise you are finished." Charlotte warned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was so horrible. How could they do it to us? We were not bad people. How could we know? No one ever told me what was happening outside the palace."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have to not concentrate on it right now. There will be time for remembering later, after you are more settled. At the time of death it is too easy to slip back into it and die again. If you die now there is no afterlife and no coming back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No coming back?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you die in the service of Eternia, it is final. In the Realms you can choose to go to an afterlife for the godling controlling your beliefs. Here you forfeit that option. There are exceptions. Sometimes you can choose to leave Eternia. A very few godlings will allow you into their afterlives in that case. If the one you want does not allow you in you have to appeal to a different one or choose the final death anyway. It is complicated and I do not understand all of it either. I know, for me, that I prefer the final death to any of the godlings."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think I understand," Anastasia answered as she stared out the window. The Mountains of Chaos rolled by, sometimes climbing high over then, sometimes dropping away as the train rushed across impossibly long and high bridges of deep chasms. Sometimes she could see the plains of Eternia in the distance, green and lush in the mid summer sun. "Maybe you could continue your story?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where was I? Oh yes - Lucy and the painted image in the exhibit. Not much else was said as they continued on. The rest of the night was about what I expected. Lucy tried to explain the little bits she knew about the exhibit, but it was little more than was on the placards on the displays themselves."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The next morning the news boys were calling out the death of a Doctor Van Helsing. He had been a respected member of the British Museum library. He was also a doctor of medicine, specializing in rare blood ailments. His body had been discovered five blocks from the museum with its heart ripped out. Before you ask, I am only reporting what I heard at the time. Now I would be curious enough to try and view the body. Then I was frightened and appalled like the rest of the populace."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Once I arrived at the Alhambra rehearsals rapidly pushed thoughts of the murder out of my mind. I lost myself in the current routine until Lucy called at noon to invite me to lunch. Mina, Isabella, Shandi, and Letitia were already seated. With them was a red haired woman dressed in upper class clothing. She was talking animatedly to Isabella and Mina while she sat very close to Shandi. As we approached Mina smiled up at Lucy, 'Isabella was just suggesting a novel new approach to our current problem. She believes we should be using electricity and magnetism to control aspects of the calculation machines.' I settled into an empty chair and tried to follow the short and very scientific conversation across the table. When there was a break Lucy introduced me to Angelique, although I had already decided her identity from the necklace tattoo she wore. At the time I found it somewhat shameful, even though I knew many in the theatre that had tattoos. It just did not seem right on a woman of her stature."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I must have been staring a bit too long because she looked at me and said, 'It is based on a design from my mother's family. I know it is not seemly, however, I am not seemly either.' I blushed bright red and looked away as she said, 'Life cut short, it continues in the city of the dead. Eternal in Eternia, hospice of the misfits. Beware the life below the traps.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Isabella looked up sharply at the words. Shandi turned to Angelique, stroked her face, and said, 'Pretty Seer.' I had to choke back laughter at the reactions around the table. I had seen women attracted to women before, however it was apparent by the reactions that the others had not. Lucy and Mina seemed scandalized while Isabella and Letitia seemed worried."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Angelique spoke again, 'Welcome Charlotte, or do you prefer your stage name? I am sorry for the ramblings. I have been to the doctors, however they can not help me.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Silly Seer. Visions gift,' Shandi said. She looked straight at me and said, 'You know.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I almost stood and bolted for the door. These people were becoming more and more disturbing the longer I spent with them. Instead I asked, 'What do you mean?'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shandi cocked her head sideways, looked at me like I was an idiot child, and replied, 'You See, Pretty Seer Sees. I not idiot.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'I am sorry. That is not what I meant. I am not much of a seer. It has never helped me much, except as a stage trick. Charlotte is fine.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Worse, to become clear, salvation of friends, cost of almost insanity." Angelique blurted out. "Friends in the beyond recieve your care."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Her words echo in my head even as I tell you this. She saw the truth of it. Since I have come to Eternia my visions have become clearer at the cost of intense headaches and sometimes dizziness. At the time, though, I didn't believe her. 'I'm just a reader of cards. Silly parlor tricks to add to my earnings.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"'Thank the gods daily that they do not grant you more,' Angelique commented. 'They have helped me little either and, like most oracles, the closer to reality they are, the more cryptic they become. Might I have seen you on stage?' I told her I often performed at the Alhambra. 'I do not think I have gone there yet. I will make it a point to do so. I like to use what small benefits my station affords me to support something that has been a welcome distraction from the loss of my family.'"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wish I had learned the craft of writing. I am trying to evoke the sense of oddness around these people and yet as I tell it, they seem mostly normal. In London of that time women rarely worked outside of taking care of the family home. Almost none worked in the sciences. Lucy and Mina were highly placed in the International Transport Consortium structure. Mina was the financial manager for a recently created division called Computational Solutions International. According to the announcements it was supposed to provide the instructions for computational machines created by International Computing Machines, another subsidiary of ITC. Lucy was in charge of everything in the division except the financial aspects. They were heroines to London women and vilified by London men."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The status of Lucy and Mina had made it as far east as St. Petersburg and Tsarskoe Selo. They were the topic of many discussions on the role of women and the falling into degradation of the British. My family was scandalised that women would have to work and endure such roles. Yet they also had many maid servants, cooks, and serving women. When I wanted to emulate those two I was severely reprimaded or punished." Anastasia remembered. "It sounds like all of you present there weren't satisfied with the more traditional roles though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, we weren't. However, Lucy, Mina and I were not the strangest of the bunch. The others, Isabella, Shandi, and Letitia, were players playing parts. I could see it in the way they moved and acted. Even Angelique was not as she appeared, although she was much closer than Isabella, Shandi, or Letitia. All of them hesitated when you called the names they gave, indicating they had not grown up with those names. The other largest indicator was the way they watched everything. No woman of that time was as alert or watchful as they were. And no women other than the queen would get immediate deference from men. At the time I had no idea where they could have come from. Now that I have been in Eternia I realize they could have been travelers such as we are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lord Willem was a maverick as well. He came from old wealth, yet, rather than sit back on the family fortunes and scoff at the new model of commerce and business, he embraced it. In 1895 ITC was the single largest grouping of commercial assets in the world. His work force was healthier and happier than any other. When an open position was announced at any of the divisions the applicants would line up the night before and wait to get in for interviews."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was invited to join this odd group of friends quite often. The longer I was near them the more the masks would slip. Isabella was obviously holding tightly onto some knowledge that far exceeded Lucy and Mina's. Whenever they would start talking of the new technologies she would sometimes roll her eyes when the others weren't looking. Angelique knew things her background as a Marsters should never have given her. And Shandi was just frightening."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"During this time, I was invited to another party at the Wellingham estate. The invitation included another journey in the private train. As it steamed through the private estate lands to the Wellingham house a vision flickered into my awareness. Inside the wooded section of their estate my vision showed a small bungalow. Moon light shimmered over it and it momentarily resolved into an octagon log hut with a thatched roof. Then it settled back into an English bungalow. It stayed in my..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute. Could you describe that in more detail?" Anastasia interrupted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, what, the bungalow?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. As much as you can remember, it reminds me of something."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, but I don't remember much more about it. It was small, smaller than the bungalow appeared when the vision faded. There was a picket type fence around it, although the boards looked twisted and frightening, more like bones than wooden slats. The yard between the fence and the hut had deep, green, rich looking grass and a profusion of flowers near the hut itself. That's about all I remember about it." Charlotte glanced at Anastasia and saw she had turned more pale than before. "What is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are legends in my country about that hut. I always thought they were stories to frighten children with. An old ogress lives in the hut and she eats chldren. She flies around in a cauldron and terrorises nearby villages. She is an oracle of great power as well. If you can petition her and not be destroyed she can lead you to your heart's desires."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A cauldron, you say? Isabella mentioned using 'the cauldron' once to Letitia. Soething like 'the cauldron will get us there fast enough'." Charlotte looked thoughtful. "I visited the bungalow though, and it was nothing like my vision. It was a simple country home with modest furnishings. The Wellinghams said it had been built as a guest cottage. Although..." she paused, trying to remember more. "when I stepped into it, there was a curious sensation, much like the Portal, only much less intense."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you never saw an old woman, or an ogress, or a black cat?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, those I would remember."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And the Wellinghams disappeared for many days?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was while in the company of these imposters that the Wellinghams disappeared. New Scotland Yard investigated and could find no indication of what had occurred. Their servants reported that they had left in the company of Isabella Valen and simply not returned. London Hospital reported the disappearance of Doctor Henry Jekyll around the same time. I mention this because the good doctor was an acquaintance of Angelique Marsters and the fiancee of Lucy Wellingham. For the next twelve days Lucy, Mina, Angelique and the others remained absent. Whenever I had a few moments I would go to one of our normal meeting places and check for them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"On the thirteenth day the Wellinghams, Mina, and Doctor Jekyll returned. They would not speak of what had happened. Isabella, Letitia, Angelique, and Shandi were never seen again. Many would say things returned to normal fairly quickly, yet I would see my friends staring into the distance often as time went on. They were sadder and more serious after they returned, although ITC developed new technologies even more rapidly than before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I tried to find out about them when I arrived here. Eternia had no record of them and did not believe there was any connection with here. I asked new recruits about them for a few years as well, but the answer was always the same. I still wonder what it all meant. There were a few mentions of someone called Margla Fleshfeaster and a magical hut, but nothing about the people I had known." Charlotte lapsed into silence. Finally she shook her head and said, "Right now we have some more pressing concerns. We are nearing Central Station, which means we are almost home. There are apartments available in Death City for you to choose from. You have the option of eating at various establishments or shopping for your own food."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait, I've never even lived on my own. Do you know how old I am? I am not even a legal adult in my country."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You, what?" Charlotte grimaced. "They never tell me the details when they send me out on one of these."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Dispatchers. They control what trains go out, where they go, and what the missions are. Most of the time they are very short on details."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here are some details for you. I am seventeen years old. I am the daughter of the Tsar of Russia and I have never had to take care of my food or housing needs in my entire life. I have no idea what to do here. I have no skills at present to offer to the ruler of this land. I have no money to present to a land holder for room or board. What is the grand plan for me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are a communal place. Everyone contributes and everyone benefits. On the rare occasion that someone donates nothing, they eventually end up leaving. Somehow the Lady arranges it. She would not have had you brought here if She did not think you would be of benefit. You can stay with me until you find a place where you would like to live. Food is easier. I have several places where I tend to go to eat. The food is good and I do not have to prepare it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What if I have no skills?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Volunteer to learn something. The primary purpose of Eternia is the rescuing of items from the Realms. The missions always need extra hands to find and move things. Being a part of that is enough donation. I can take you to Central Station once we get you settled and you can sign up. They will help work out a schedule and you can arrange to not go out until you are more settled in. It is recommended you do not go out for a while. Many of the dead places are disturbing and ugly and it is easier to deal with once you feel comfortable here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I do not understand. How can this be such a large task? Only a few areas are destroyed each year, yet you make it sound like there is vast destruction."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is happening on countless worlds across countless dimensions. We are not only concerned with the Realms we came from but with every Realm in the vastness of creation. And I can tell you truthfully that the idea of our earth being the center of the universe or the only place with life is utterly false. It should not be how many angels can dance on the head of a pin but how many godlings can dance there. You will find there are plenty of missions to participate in. So many that you could not volunteer for all of them even if you wanted to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia was looking at the village outside the train as it slowed to enter the station. "But this is a small town. Where are the storage sheds and the homes for the people you say are involved?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There are spurs off this line that lead to other cities and towns. We passed through a large city a little while back. Other spur lines lead to the warehouses and the inventory shops that keep track of the recovered items and schedule their shipment back into the Realms. As you find your way around you will find out where these places are. And now we are here. I am thinking of getting food at the Adam and Eve. It is close and the food, while simple, is excellent. It is always crowded but worth the trouble. When we are done I will take you back to my place for now. It is small, but I can find a place for you." The train eased to a stop under a spider web arch of glass and steel. Mid afternoon sunshine filtered through the smoke and dust motes and sparked fire from the polished workings of other trains arriving, leaving, or waiting. People called to each other as they hurried about their business.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The com chimed softly before the voice came again. "I hate to rush you, but the train is needed for another run."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Charlotte replied, "We are just leaving. Thank you John." She led the way back through a well appointed sitting room and out onto the back platform. They descended onto the brick work platform and turned toward the main bulk of the station.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Charlotte led the way through the moving masses of people toward one of the gates into the main section of the building. "Just so you know, you have a bit of time where you can still choose not to be here. After three or four days though most godlings will no longer allow you into their domains. But it is one last opportunity to exit gracefully if you find it is impossible for you to remain here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Charlotte headed off to the right and exited into a cobbled street. Timber and plaster buildings lined the winding street as it meandered toward a tall cathedral spire. "Ahead of us is the Cathedral of All Faiths, the closest we come to religious edifices here. We will pass around behind it and end up at the pub, which is on cathedral lands." She waved and greeted people as they went.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stopped and stared up at the cathedral as they approached. Graceful arches and butresses supported the towering structure. "It is something isn't it?" She nodded at Charlotte's observation. Reluctantly she followed after Charlotte when she started walking again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They rounded the cathedral and walked through the gardens and plantings of the close. They could hear the laughter and voices of the outside diners long before the pub came into view. It was a small two level brick affair nestled in among old trees. Tables were lined up in neat rows outside the front door. Every table was full to over-flowing. Two serving women bustled to and fro trying to keep food and drink flowing fast enough for the voracious crowd. One, the smaller, blonde woman, looked up and waved, "Charlotte, hi. See you made it back ok. Who's your friend? The new recruit?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jo, meet Anastasia. Jo is the daughter of the publican. Keep her happy or you will not get your food."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jo laughed musically in response,"There's a table or two in the vault. The dinner rush hasn't started quite yet." Charlotte led the way through the even more crowded upper common rooms. The main one in the front where the bar was and the one in the back. A spiral brick stairwell took them down to the vast brickwork vault beneath the small structure. Thick arches of brick reached up to support the high ceiling. A massive fireplace blasted heat into the room to counter the chill of the stone and earth. Voices echoed and bounced from the many tables providing a background wash of sound. Two small tables were still available near the wall away from the stairs. Charlotte steered them to the closest one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But the building above is so much smaller," Anastasia began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And too small. This gives them almost enough space. Jo thought it up. It is based on a painting she saw. At least that is what Big Joe says."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Big Joe?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The publican and Jo's father. Her name is Josephine, but everyone calls her Jo. Big Joe always wanted a son to carry on the pub when he died."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you said people do not die here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They do not. I knew Joe and his family before. They come from London as well. It is a tragic tale with this happy ending. Maybe some day he will share it with you. It is not for me to tell. That is a rule here. Everyone has a past, however it is for them to determine if it gets told. To tell the past of another is extremely rude."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A serving girl bustled up, flopped down a couple of menus, and listed off various specials. Charlotte ordered her usual fare of bangers and mash while Anastasia ordered fresh fruit and buns. Anastasia's eyes roverd around the room, taking in the casual clothing, boisterous coversations, and general atmosphere of the place. Soon food and coffee arrived. Coffee was served in large cups, the food arrived on chipped and plain china, with simple silverware.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Charlotte dug right in with ittle attempt at propriety. "It will not be any better the longer you wait. Eat," she said over a mouthful of food. She laughed at Anastasia's dismayed expression and switched to portay a fully proper lady eating at the club, complete with miniscule bites of food and tiny sips of her coffee. "There, is that better?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a few moments it was, then Anastasia began to realize how wrong it was for where they were. "You have made your point. Please stop now." She picked up her own utensils and began to eat slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once they had finished Charlotte stood and motioned to Anastasia, "You should get some more rest. Ready to head out?" She led the way back out of the pub. After several twists and turns down narrow cobbled streets she stopped in front of an unmarked door. It was to the side of an empty shop in the street level of a yellow timber and plaster building. Behind the door was a narrow stairway up to a small landing. There was a door to their left and a door directly in front. Charlotte opened the left hand door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Behind the door was an inside entry hallway with a small coat rack at the end. There were two doors along the left wall of the hall. The first opened into a sitting room, lit by the afternoon sun streaming in through the front windows. Below was the street they had entered from. The second door opened into the rear sitting room area of the main room. A door on the far side of the sitting room led into a smallish bedroom with a window facing the street as well. A simple double bed sat below the window with a deep red cover and several large pillows. From the rear sitting room area there was a door that opened into a connecting area between a nursery room and the kitchen. A door on the far side of the empty nursery room connected to the front bedroom. The kitchen was both kitchen and eating area. A small table sat near the front entry with a single chair drawn up to it. Cabinets and a stove were to the rear. To the right was a pantry with empty shelves and an open ice box. Charlotte shrugged, embarrassed, "I do not cook much. And I am not often here. It has enough for me to rest between trips out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A second door farther back in the kitchen opened into the bathroom. A window on the back wall looked out over a small landing and steep stairs running down to the narrow alley behind the building. "I am sorry there is not much more room. You can sleep with me toonight, if that is acceptable. I have a spare night gown that should fit you well enough. In the morning we can find another bed at the recovery center if you want to stay here a while. In any case we can get you some additional things for here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you. I think you are right, I should rest now," Anastasia said as she swayed slightly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"> /* Dementai explains some of the cosmology/mythology behind Death City and the Lady */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There isn't much to go on, however, this is what I have managed to figure out. At the beginning there were two things, two primals, the creator and the destructor. When they moved apart the universe came into being. The creator began to create and the creation had time to exist before the destructor could destroy it. Part of this splitting apart created the three eldest aspects or greater powers. These were order, chaos, and balance. These aspects learned over time the the creator and the destructor were seeking to move back together again. This would end the universe and unmake the aspects. So the aspects decided to imprison the two primals. The battles and trickery necessary to imprison the primals resulted in the splintering off of many fragments. Each fragment became its own entity and began forming and influencing the beings it created and the beings of others that created them. These godlings, the lesser powers, are the ones worshipped on the worlds of the Realms. In an effort to balance the cascading mess created by these godlings, the Balance Aspect created the Lady. The Lady sits outside the proxy wars and provides a refuge and a relief for those that tire of the endless petty squabbles. I am not sure how this is actually supposed to help with the balance, but that is where she started. The Lady is greater than any single proxy god, however, if they were to gather together and unite to fight her, she would be in danger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"> /* more about her life in London - a few days after arrival, they are at a coffee shop near the flat */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know how I died, can I ask how you did?" Anastasia asked over coffee.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ah, yes. I was careless actually. One night, after a show, I was returning props to the storage area under the stage. While I was back behind a box of props the door opened again and a tall oriental man came in. He crossed directly to a far part of the basement and bent down to pull up a trap door I hadn't even noticed. I must have made some sound because he turned and stared at me with the most intense green eyes I have ever seen. They were hypnotic. I think he came closer to me and I felt a small pain, like a bee sting. I awoke on a train headed to Eternia."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"> /* Dementai goes to recruit Ennui and the first break of the Truce spills over into a mission Anastasia is on */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Wind stuttured fitfully through the ruins of the city. It swirled snow around them as it created random drifts. The cold cut through their clothes and left them shivering in the watery sunlight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia was in the lead as they entered the art gallery. Most of the roof was in rubble piles on the floor of the entryway. Drifts of snow hid treacherous footing and pockets in the wreckage. Ahead, the main gallery didn't look much better. She consulted her pad and said, "There are only three items we need to recover. The first two are in the second gallery off the main one. The third is a sculpture currently in secure storage in the basement."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly the team picked its way across. Lyssa, in the lead, poked at the snow with a long piece of wood she had picked up. She charted a twisting route to the main gallery.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">More of the ceiling remained there and the walking was easier. The first two items were easy to find and quickly recovered from the side galleries.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The only passable way to the basement was a narrow emergency route under the wreckage of the offices. It took several false starts before they found a way through the wreckage that would let them down. Wind whistled through the shattered windows and puffed powdery snow through the rubble. The narrow steps descended into a cold darkness. Anastasia led with a high power light piercing the gloom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A dark corridor branched left and right at the base of the stairs. Closes doors marched off in both directions. A low moaning came from the left on a faint breeze. "To the right and four doors down should be the vault entry." Anastasia spoke in hushed tones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The door opened onto the vault. The large door was still closed and sealed. Natalya moved up to examine the door. "Not the worst I've seen. I should be able to get it open without explosives." She pulled out a laser cutter and started cutting. The rest of the team settled in to wait.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shadows flowed and thickened outside the door. Glowing red eyes peered in. Dark forms darted back and forth, drawing nervous glances from the waiting team. "Remember, the Truce." Anastasia said into the shadows. For a few moments the shadows drew back. Then the echo of a laugh shivered through the air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In a wave the shadows darted for the door. Lyssa fell back with claw tracks across her face. Dark figures boiled into the room. "No more Truce," one of the figures cackled in triumph.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Natalya spun, slashing one of the shadows with her laser cutter. It drew back howling in pain. Anton picked up a shovel and swung it in front of himself. Anastasia grabbed a flare, snapped it open, lit it, and shoved it at the creature nearest her. Fighting and scrambling they pushed the things back and darted for the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The shadows pursued them to the edge of the shadows in the stairwell. On the surface the team sighed in relief. Leering and gibbering grey figures peered in from the building around them. Slowly the figures advanced. Wicked clawed hands and sharp teeth were revealed as they stepped into the roofless room. "Out the window. Make for the train!" Anastasia yelled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Natalya pulled a block of explosives and began working on it as the team scrambled through the window and onto the snow outside. Her hands flew quickly, cutting a piece off and attaching a detonator. "Out, now!" she shouted. She stuffed the remains back in her pack and dove out the window as she pushed the detonator handle. Smoke and charred flesh billowed out the window as the shock wave deafened them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They staggered back to the train, hearing slowly returning. At the train Anastasia called the driver, "Get us out of here. The dark ones have broken the Truce." Next she put in a call to Dispatch. When Merris answered she began, "Merris, the dark ones.."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Have broken the Truce. I know. We have had casualties on another world where the attacked. Get out of there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We already are."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">/* recovery of theatre organ - ends up at the Cathouse - stored at first until Kali comes across it and suggests it for Love's Bitch */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia followed Beth behind the large silver screen that had been nailed into place across the proscenium arch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are you looking for back here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sometimes the ceiling access is from the stage side. I'm hoping to find a ladder up to where it might be."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Using a head lamp to keep her hands free Anastasia played the light over the jumble of old props, chairs, and dust of neglect. The old curtains had been left in place, screening the wings and the back of the stage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Beth pulled on the stage right leg about half way back to clear a bit more space to walk through. The curtain pooled at her feet as the rotten fabric tore loose from above. Dust billowed up from it in a choking cloud. "Such a waste. A wonderful old theatre like this used only for a movie hall." She slipped through the opening she had made and swivelled her light around. Ropes stretched up to the fly space above. Faded tape marked the set positions for various batons. Weights were stacked neatly underneath, waiting for use to balance heavy pieces. A discarded pointe shoe peeked forlornly from behind a coil of rope under a sand-bagged line.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Beth turned her light toward the front of the stage, still looking to find the ladder up. Her light played across a tarp wrapped shape sitting next to the wire caged ladder to the overhead pulleys and systems. She slowed as she reached the ladder. One hand extended to grasp the first rung. "What are you waiting for?" Anastasia asked from behind her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Beth jumped, startled. "I wonder what's under the canvas. Someone cared enough to cover that one item."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia shrugged and cut the rope with her utility knife. She twitched the canvas away to reveal a large organ console. Beth stared, "I haven't seen one of those for.. well, for longer than I would want to say."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"An organ? In a theatre? What's so special about that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not just an organ. It's a theatre organ," Beth replied as she gently ran her fingers over the keys and stops.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well that explains it then. Of course it has to be a theatre organ, we aren't in a church after all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Beth favored her with a sharp glare. "It's not just an organ. This would play drums, piano, horns, and all manner of different sound effects just by which stops I selected. I wonder if it's all here. Do you know what I could do with this? It would be absolutely perfect for some of the opening numbers we play. I wonder if it still works?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Somehow I think not. No power for the amps and where were the speakers?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much of a theatre history buff are you? This is a pipe organ. It uses air and electric controls. The pipes have to be in the house somewhere. There should be a bunch of other instruments there as well. We have to take this back with us!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh no you don't. This isn't on the manifest. We haven't been allocated time or resources for it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Beth switched on her com, "Andrew? Andrew, you there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, Beth, is that you? Is there a problem?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, everything's fine. We found something we should recover though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh huh, what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A theatre organ, might be in good shape too. The console is."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right. I'll check. Merris didn't give us much time on the ground here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm going to check this ladder," Anastasia said. Beth ignored her and continued to inspect the organ. Moving around behind she found the old wiring harness still connected to the building cables.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Half way to the grid above the stage Anastasia found the door through the stage wall into the house ceiling. "Andrew?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anastasia?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I found the way in. It's on the stage. Bring a small cutter, it's a locked steel door half way up the stage wall."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia heard tearing sounds as Andrew and two others cut their way through the silver fabric at the front of the stage. She heard a muffled "Yes!" drift up from Beth as Andrew walked away from her. Anastasia slipped onto the ladder up to the grid to make room for John and Andrew as they climbed up from below.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The scream of abrasives on metal soon echoed through the building as John attacked the door. Within minutes he had cut through the hinges and pried the door out of it's frame. He set it aside carefully and secured it with a bit of rope. "Come on, Stasia, give us a hand in here," John called as he stepped through the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Instead of the ceiling space Anastasia had expected they were faced with a room full of tuned pipes, electrically controlled instruments, and other strange items. "Must be part of Beth's theatre organ," Anastasia muttered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Looks in decent shape, except for the wiring," John commented. The cloth wiring had been chewed to bare copper in many places. Large mouse nests were tucked into various corners and in the larger pipes. John eased his way over to the front grill and baffles. Carefully he pried them open and peered out into the gloom of the house. "We're about forty feet below the ceiling."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia led the way up to the next platform where John once again cut his way through the door hinges. Welded steel catwalks hung from steel "I" beams that had been installed to help support the ceiling. Short bars held up parts of the old wood framing members that had been the original framing. Electrical boxes had been fastened onto various places where they could feed to the electric lights. A complicated winch and pulley system supported the central chandelier, the target of this part of the recovery. A spider-webbing of cables fed down to it to provide various levels of illumination.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">John pulled out a clip on monitor and started checking the wires. "It's all dead. I'll cut it loose. Then we can see if we have anything that will power the winch. I don't want to try and lower this by hand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What would you like me to do?" Anastasia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"For now, spot us to make sure we don't fry ourselves because something is still live," Andrew replied as he examined the winch. "Looks standard enough." He pulled out tools and started stripping off cover plates and connections.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once the cables were pulled loose and tucked back out of the way he spoke into the com. "Jenn is bringing a generator over from the other site. Stasia, could you help her run a line up to us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure. I'm headed down to meet her, you going to be ok up here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you hear us shout, get out of center house."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Funny, very funny!" She climbed down to where Beth was still studying the organ. "We found a large room with pipes and stuff up about fifty feet."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, good," Beth muttered as she read the stops. "Four manuals, many sub-units, there should be at least one more chamber, probably stage left. This is a large unit, lots of pipes in many ranks, as well as lots of additional equipment. Have you found the blower room yet? It should be located away from the case you found, to keep the noise down."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, no, don't think so. Where should I look?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. Maybe above the grid, so it could get outside air. Maybe on the roof or in a side room off the fly space. Then again, some designs place the blower over one of the cases to collect air at the same temperature as the pipes. It helps keep the tuning from varying with air temperature and pressure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll take a look when I go back up. Andrew and John are working on the chandelier. Am I to guess someone approved recovering the organ?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Merris herself said we had up to another day we could spend here. I hope that's long enough. These things are very complex and I don't know enough to be certain of getting all the right pieces."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is a lot of damage. Mice have made quite an elaborate home in the pipes we found. How long is it going to take to restore this once you get it back?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A long time, although I still want to try. This would be such an addition to the Cathouse. I've wanted to play one of these for a long time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stiffened as her com chimed the signal that signaled an extraction type event. She stepped away from Beth with a small shrug of an appology. "Anastasia, incursion with high probability near an old theatre. Can you locate the building?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I am in the building right now. Beth is recovering the organ you ok'd."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right. Incursion is likely in the basement, under the stage. Dementia is fairly certain you can push them back with the part of the team you have. If you can hold the door to the boiler room you should be fine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fairly certain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. If not, fall back and get clear. Nothing in this rescue is so valuable as to require extreme measures."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And on and on it goes..." Anastasia muttered as she cleared the com. "Beth, call the rest of the team and hurry up with the organ. It's going to get dangerous here very soon." She pushed another button on her com, "Team, form up in the theatre. We have incoming in the basement. Alert the rest of the rescue team that they may need to get to the train in a hurry if this goes badly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The team assembled quickly. Of the eight people who had volunteered for the extraction team only six were present on the current mission. Every world they landed on they would search for better items, however the searches hadn't yeilded much yet. Mark had a long length of heavy pipe and a coil of wire in addition to the rest of his gear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia led the way down the access stairs to the basement. Their head lamps cast shadows from the pipes and conduits cluttering the narrow passage. Ahead she could make out the 'No Admitance' sign on the boiler room door. She waved Mark forward where he set the pipe across the door and frame. Swiftly he started to wire it to the handle to keep the door from swinging inward.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mark only managed one loop of wire before the door was jerked sharply open. Three small grey creatures stared back before the lead one slammed a knife into Mark's chest. He staggered back in shock as Anastasia raised an old pistol. The report was sharp and loud in the narrow hall. The lead grey being dropped and the other two tried to dart forward. Alisha fired from behind Anastasia. She grazed the one in the doorway and it drew back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cover me,"Anastasia yelled as she ran for the door. She grabbed the handle and hauled it closed again. Frantically she wrapped the wire around the handle, then leaned against the far wall with her gun aimed at the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny slipped forward and took a quick look at Mark. "Looks like the knife missed everything vital, but I still need to get him back to the medical car." He pulled his com out and called to the other team for assistance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia sat against the wall and stared at the door. Thoughts bounced around in her head. Mark was the third injury in as many extraction missions. Each time things had been just a little bit worse. Mark was the closest to seriously injured that had happened so far, but it was starting to unsettle her. She let out a tiny sigh and almost missed the twitching of the door knob.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her attention snapped back as the knob turned. She motioned for her team to come forward. Quickly they moved closer and focused on the door. Lauren focused on the knob, moved her hands in a complicated pattern, then smiled as the knob started to glow red. A sharp cry from the far side told of some success.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We need something decissive," Alisha snarled. "They can keep bringing any number in behind that door."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn it, I wish Ennui were here. She did some truly frightening things with magic on that last rescue mission i headed up," Lauren added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Like what?" Anastasia asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Held a door closed even when the demons were melting it. Brought a building down on top of the passage when they broke through the door finally."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You saw her do it. Do you think you could..." Anastasia began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. She pulled power from places and in ways I've never even thought were possible." Lauren stared at the door for long moments, deep in thought. "Although I might be able to freeze the lock and hinges. That would slow down the shock troups. It won't stop them if they bring magic into it, though." She stared hard at the door, then moved her hands in a weird and complex set of motions. "Maybe if I studied with Ennui she could teach me some of what she does, if she even knows herself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We have some explosives as part of the recovery team tool kit. I could rig a shape charge to bring down the ceiling," Natalya volunteered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We don't want to collapse the building. There things here we would like to recover if possible. Could you do something similar, but less damaging if we could drive these things back to point of entry?" Anastasia answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, depends on what the entry point is in. Shall I run for the explosives?" Natalya asked. She stood and hurried out at Anastasia's quick nod.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A nameless face ran up with the stretcher Danny had called for. "Demons?" he asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," Danny replied. Swiftly he loaded Mark on the stretcher. "There are more behind the door."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know some of the old magical sealing symbols. Would that help?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know, it might. You could ask Anastasia. She's sitting staring at the door next to us. Alisha, feeling strong? Could you help me with Mark?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess... Beats sitting here waiting for shit to go down." She hauled up on her end of the strectcher. Slowly they worked their way toward the stairs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia continued to stare at the door, not even hearing the conversation near her. Her thoughts turned to resignation, as they had been doing more and more often of late. Once again she ran over her crew list. None of them would be able to take over and there were no others waiting in the wings. There were people capable of handling the pressure or the danger, but none capable of both. With a weary sigh she began considering options for another running fight with the dark forces.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stasia? You still with us?" Lauren's voice roused her finally.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, still here," she instantly regreted the tiredness she'd let slip into her voice when she saw the worried frowns on their faces. "Sorry, just tired." She added with a forced energy. "What is it Lauren?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Aaron here knows some of the old magic sealing symbols. He's willing to try a few on the door if you think it might keep those things from breaking through."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess it couldn't hurt. Go ahead Aaron."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aaron pulled several colored markers out of a pocket and started tracing complex patterns on the door. As he finished each one it would glow with a color similar to the marker and then fade into the door. Twenty minutes later he finished the last one. "Those are the ones I know. Hope they help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So do I. Ok people, we keep an eye on this door in watches of four hours each. One of us awake at all times, the rest sleeping or resting here. Aaron, could you let the upstairs teams know to send us food and have a couple people bring down sleeping gear? Merris promised Beth another day here. Let's see if we can make that happen. I'll take first watch."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"> By the third hour of her watch Anastasia was struggling to remain awake. The door remained silent and still in front of her. The fifth time her eyes drifted shut she stood and prodded at Lauren, "Your turn now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lauren struggled awake. Blinking in the dim light of the portable lamps. "Any thing happen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. Everything is fine. I am just having touble keeping awake. Better to take shorter watches and stay awake. Rouse Lissa when you start to fade."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure." Lauren settled herself where she could watch the door. Anastasia moved off to an empty sleeping pallet. She lay down, closed her eyes and waited for sleep. Her mind played images of Mark getting stabbed inter-cut with images of the injuries on previous missions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<a NAME="mystery"></a>
<p class="regtxt5"> /* this section comes much later - it is in the time of Kali, after the truce has broken */</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> /* cosider - incorporating the organ recovery above with this - the organ recovery is the mission they were out on */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia and her team were on the way back from a simple extraction when they passed near a thriving Realm. A siren song called to her from the surface. Before she realized what she was doing she began her descent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was a dark grey night when they dropped onto the empty stretch of track. One of those nights that could be almost any time of year except summer. The track was part of a small rail yard in the middle of a residential area of a small city. Ahead of them a figure in a long black duster with a weathered forest green backpack was walking along the tracks. Anastasia automatically slowed the train as they came up on them. Without a word the figure stopped and turned toward the tracks. As the engine slowed to a stop she walked to the ladder up and silently waited.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After a minute Anastasia opened the cab door and called down, "What would you like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Silently she held up a pad of paper. On it was written, "I request a ride on the Death City Metro. I enter of my own free will. My name is not important."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All thought of asking her name fled as Anastasia read the words and replied, "Enter and be welcome, then." Anastasia was able to get a better look at the woman as she climbed into the cab. Faded was the first word that came to mind. Her black leather duster was worn and old. She wore faded olive cammo pants and a dusty rose T-shirt. Her eyes were a washed out blue, her hair no-color brown, and she was thin and ordinary. It would be very hard to pick her out of a crowd. Silently she stepped over to the spare jump seat, stuffed the notepad into her pack, and settled in. Anastasia opened her mouth to start a conversation, but, when she turned to the woman, the words froze on her tongue. The woman sat wrapped in a stillness so complete she could not intrude.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The woman remained silent and immobile as the train climbed away from the world and into the void. Her complete disinterest puzzled Anastasia. Most newcomers expressed some reaction to the leaving of a world. This woman looked once, then turned and remained immobile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It wasn't until the train neared the Portal that the woman stood swiftly and moved to the window. Her eyes shifted until she was staring directly into the Portal before Anastasia could issue any sort of warning. For the briefest moment she seemed to shimmer and shift in the same pattern as the Portal. It was so quick Anastasia couldn't be sure she had really seen it. "It's not a good idea to stare too long into the Portal. It's too easy to get lost in it," Anastasia warned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The woman turned to look at Anastasia and for the briefest moment the Portal shimmered where her eyes should have been. Her lips twitched in an almost smile as her eyes returned. Her head swiveled back to staring at the Portal. Unnerved, Anastasia concentrated on driving.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the instant the train entered the Portal the figure tilted her head back and seemed to drink it in. On the other side she twitched her head, almost like a cat settling its fur after a wind. She spun and returned to the jump seat, where she pulled out her pad once more. She wrote rapidly for a moment, then stood.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia began to slow for the station until the woman swiftly crossed to her and placed the notepad in her line of sight. "She has forgotten. There is no reason to stop," was written on it. She returned to the jump seat and settled back into her stillness. Anastasia released the brakes with a shaking hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The woman didn't stir again until the train neared Central Station. She wrote briefly on her notepad as the train slowed. When the locomotive came to a stop she stood and turned the pad to Anastasia. "Thank you," was all it said. Silently she climbed down, darted swiftly across the platform, keeping to as many shadows as possible, and disappeared into the station.</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Merris introduces Kali - before returning to Portal Station */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris approached the small office area where Anastasia could be found between missions. She was inside checking over some of her equipment. "May I come in?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Merris, down from the Portal?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Had to come down and check up on the aftermath of that last big one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, about that one..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it's ok. If you hadn't been on the other mission it would have been far more of a loss. No, what I wanted to ask was if I could assign another person to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. It's not like we're overstaffed or anything," Anastasia replied with a frown. "Why are you even asking?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Because my suggestion is a new arrival, however she has distinguished herself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, you are suggesting Kali. What is your hesitation? I heard what she did, and from enough of the people there to know she didn't hide in the background like she would have us believe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, and that's my worry. I don't think she's comfortable with how out in front she ended up being. My only hesitation is she will now try and hold back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't think she will, but, I'd like to meet her before I decide."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's at Temple Heath, we can drop by there and I'll introduce the two of you. I need to talk to Bart anyway." Merris led the way across the large rail bridge across the Death City River and along the edge of the tracks to the Temple Heath Locomotive Yards. She opened the small personnel door and stepped into the word of a thriving locomotive repair facility. Several units were in various stages of disassembly with technicians working on them The smell of deisel oil, lubricants, welding, soot, and smoke assaulted them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A small thin woman looked up from a set of plans she was reviewing. "Merris and Anastasia, what brings you to our humble shop?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hi Claire. We're looking for Kali. Is she around?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She and Bart are working on Shergar, across the shop in bay 3. Here, let me show you." Claire deftly herded them through the activities in the shop and deposited them in front of Shergar. "Hey Bart, is Kali up there with you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No," Bart replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm over here," Kali answered at the same time. She pulled herself out of the pit under the locomtive and stood. "Merris, hey," she added shyly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey yourself," Merris said, smiling. "Kali, this is Anastasia. She heads up the extraction team. I told her you were wanting to join up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hi," Anastasia held out a hand whle she looked Kali over. She was tall, with a dancer's body. Her face was angular and striking, framed by a riotous tangle of dark red hair, pulled back and tied with a wide leather strip. Her grey eyes were warm, like autumn sunlight on gathering clouds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hi." Kali took the hand briefly after wiping hers on her coveralls.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They looked at each other for a long moment before Anastasia asked, "What has Merris told you about extractions?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much more than I found out for myself. They are dangerous and unpredicatble. Also, that I don't have to sign up forever if I freak out. What can you add?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much additional either. Dementia gets visions which help quite a bit. When she has them they are quite accurate. There is a core team of eight of us that have been doing this since almost the beginning, a little over a year ago." Anastasia looked closely at Kali, "I heard about your mission with Sammi and Jemima. Are you willing to go into battle with the same ferocity next time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia noticed the haunted look pass over Kali's features. "I don't know." She answered honestly. "It still disturbs me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stared deep into Kali's eyes for a long moment. Within she saw an unsettledness. Behind the somewhat cautious look a shadow paced in it's cage. When it detected her stare it turned and looked out at her. In that instant she knew Kali would be fine. "I think you have nothing to worry about. I would be honored to have you on my team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stared back into Anastasia's face. She saw a tired woman. Pain and worry lurked just below the surface. "Thank you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll leave you two to work out the details. I need to talk to Bart then I'm headed back to Portal Station." Merris said as she turned to find Bart.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali grabbed her in a large hug, held on for a moment, then released her. "See you later!" Once Merris had gone Kali asked, "How does this work? Is it like a volunteer fire department where I come and live at the station during my shift?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, nothing quite like that. You get a com unit that has the channels for my team. You agree to keep it with you when you are available and you let me know when you want to turn it off. If you decide to quit, you give it back. When a mission is called, I contact the team over the com units and we gather at Central Station. When everyone is there, we go. I have to warn you though, we don't have the best of equipment for this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I saw that when I went out with Sammi and Jemima."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Right, sorry about that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No problem. I don't mind the introductory speech now that I've seen one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's about it really. I am in charge. Follow the lead of the other team members until you figure out your strengths, and try to stay alive. So far we haven't lost anybody..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you are worried about that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, considering what happened to you, and that rescue team, I am very worried."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How many are there on the team?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Eight of us right now. There have been a few times when there have been more, but very few people last more than one mission."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* another section - Kali on an early extraction with Anastasia and team - update to match the first extraction with Kali */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The grey beings boiled out of the door, attacking everyone in sight. Screams erupted from the first to feel the claws. Kali whirled and darted into the mass of them. Her hands flashed and clawed, grey beings rippled back in shock. The rescuers scrambled away from the mass of beings. "Get back to the train!" Kali screamed as the grey beings rushed forward in a wave.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claws raked and whistled past Kali's moving form. Numbers allowed several to land leaving tracks of red and torn cloth in their wake. Strips of her torn boilersuit began to tangle in her movements. A quick twist gained her enough space to slash the top fragments loose from the bottom. She flung the shredded remains from her and into a tangle of attacking forms. They dropped back long enough for her to claw the bottom parts away from her legs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lauren started dropping ones on the edge with her magic while Anastasia rushed forward to help Kali. When she got closer she saw Kali spin and rip the last remains of her boilersuit from her body. She danced on in only a black thong, sports bra, and her heavy leather boots. Bluish ichor and bits of grey flesh clung to her. Here and there a splash of red revealed a scratch or cut. Muscles rippled and flowed in hypnotic fluid motion under her tanned skin. Her feet danced from stone floor onto dead grey things and back to the stone without her even noticing. The grey things fought with claws and long knives. Kali fought with her hands and feet. Heavy boots crushed skulls and curved talon-like hands ripped oozing chunks from them. Her hair flew loose in a wild curtain behind her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stifled a scream as one being grabbled the flying bundle of Kali's hair. Kali spun with the pull and dropped the creature without a sign of discomfort. When she saw Anastasia she smiled a terrible smile and waved her on. Her voice drifted through the screams, clear and warm, "Come, dance with me. There is plenty for all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia fought on the edges, accounting for a small number of the foe. Lauren had dropped another small percentage. Kali brought down the rest. By the time she was finished Anastasia was looking on with a mixture of fascination and terror. Kali stood in the center of the carnage, head and arms raised high. Her mouth moved in some sort of silent chant. For a flickering instant Anastasia thought she saw something else standing there. Kali dropped her head and arms back down and picked her way carefully over the corpses. She stopped in front of Anastasia and seemed to shiver. Wild energy bled off her, leaving a startled woman looking out through troubled eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui was right, warrior woman," Anastasia whispered softly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So much, so much death," Kali replied softly. Her haunted eyes took in the large pile of corpses. She shivered in the dank building. Her eyes drifted down to take in her appearance. "When did...oh, right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have a spare set of clothes at the train." Anastasia gently took Kali's hand and started to lead her away. Kali followed without protest. The rest of the team looked on in surprise as Kali calmly walked past them with no sign of discomfort at her state of undress.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The last of the battle frenzy and andrenaline faded as Kali followed Anastasia onto the train. By the time they reached Anastasia's compartment she was shivering violently. Kali tried to push away the offered blanket, "I'm covered in ick."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It will wash out. You need to get warm." Anastasia wrapped the blanket tightly around Kali and held her close. Warmth seeped slowly into her, easing the reaction and the chill. Gradually Kali stopped shaking and sagged toward the bed. Anastasia lowered her to it, grabbed another blanket, and tucked her in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali fell into a deep sleep almost immediately. Anastasia watched her for long moments. She looked up as Lauren entered. "How is she? That was incredible, what she did. I had heard the stories, but, wow..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, I know. I wonder what price she pays though."</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">/* another section - this is Kali and Anastasia accidentally meeting at the gym - Kali has gone on a few extractions and has started dancing with Love's Bitch */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It had been a long session. First Kali had demonstrated for the begining class and then moved on to three hours of individual work. She had her towel around her neck and was almost to the locker room when Anastasia emerged from the basement stairs. "Kali, hey, I didn't know you came here. Working out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dance classes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are you taking dance classes for? You certainly don't need them from what I've seen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Practice and perfecting. It's one of those things, even if you're good, taking classes makes you better. You get critiques and pointers, and it keeps the bad habits from forming. Were you working out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kick boxing. It helps with the fighting."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wicked cool. Would you show me some time?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you'd show me some of the dance things you do. Some of the simpler stuff. What you do with Love's Bitch is amazing! I've always wondered, when does someone have to start to be as good as you are? Just after they learn to walk?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. I didn't dance until I came here. In the Realms my mind and body didn't work very well together. Mostly I tripped over things, bumped into things, and dropped more things than I managed to carry. When I arrived here my mind and body started to like each other. Once they began talking I could move. In fact I couldn't stop moving. My adaptation reaction was so much energy I had to dance for hours before I could sleep. Then I'd wake up and want to start all over again. Don't get me wrong, I love it, it was just very surprising at first. When did you start kick-boxing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Long after I arrived. I came here a very long time ago now. One of the first volunteers for an extraction mission knew how. When I saw him take down the opposition with it I knew I wanted to learn. He hooked me up with Sorapong here at Freda's. I've been working on it ever since. You studying with Jessi?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. She's cool. I'm learning all the things I should already know to dance the way I do. It's really weird to learn things in a backwards sort of order."</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">/* there should be several extractions where Kali is not in charge, but distinguishes herself */</p>

</br>

<a NAME="closing"></a>
<p class="regtxt5">/* extraction where Ennui takes control of the magic and Kali takes control of the tactics - Anastasia was supposed to be in charge - will need to update Adventures with this new data as well - currently this is the old ver from Adventures - Kali will tell Ennui to think Balance instead of Destruction as she stabilizes the magic Anastasia, Lauren, and Alisha began */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The main team was told the mission was a routine rescue, pick up a list of items and return. After the main briefing Merris asked Anastasia to remain behind for a few minutes. "There is more to this mission. I need you to take a small team and slow down the opening of a demon gate. You only need to slow them down long enough for the main team to finish, although, if you can destroy the gate, do so."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why haven't you warned the rescue team?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There would be complications if they know. Dangerous complications."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where do we need to go?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Merris pulled out another copy of the map. "I have circled the approximate location. It is just over the ridge in the next valley. Dementia believes the construction is nearly complete. You need to take Ennui as part of your team."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ennui? Ennui doesn't usually do these."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, however Dementia was most insistent. You know how she can be when the visions speak."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, but this is under protest."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I understand."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Is there any other data?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is all we have," Merris answered as she handed over a thin packet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia opened it and gave it a quick scan. "Shit. You know this could go very wrong, don't you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah. But maybe it won't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anyone ever tell you that you're an optimist?" When she saw Merris roll her eyes she continued, "Didn't think so. I'll see if I can pull it off again." She turned and left Dispatch without waiting for Merris to respond.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the door closed behind her John spoke softly, "Why didn't you tell her all of it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It would distract her at the wrong time. As you get more familiar with the team leaders you will come to know how much information is too much for each one. Our job is to give them only the data that will give them the best chance of success. Anastasia needs the fear to keep her sharp."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's still cruel boss."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, it is," Merris sighed.</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stalked to the train, tension eating at her. She pasted on the most calm look she could manage as she boarded and hurried to a seat in the back of the passenger coach. Once the train had passed through the Portal she gathered her usual team of Danny, Lauren, Lissa and Alisha. She quickly briefed them on their real mission. "Ennui will be joining us on this mission. Before you protest Head Dispatch assigned her specially for this mission. I want you to keep her from getting hurt."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia gathered Ennui once the main team had spread out to begin the recoveries. She outlined the mission and specifically instructed Ennui to be careful. Then she headed up the ridge toward the location of the demon forces. As the team reached the top of the ridge Anastasia motioned for them to get down and move forward slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When the team reached the drop into the adjacent valley they saw a cluster of buildings around a stone circle. As they watched, grey skinned beings emerged from several of the building and poured a large tub of fluid into the center of the circle. More figures emerged and formed a ring around the stones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later a larger being emerged from another building and crossed to the ring of beings. It strode into the center and began an intricate, hypnotic ritual. Anastasia motioned everyone back. She was ignored by the entire team. It wasn't until she turned each person's head away that she was able to break the trance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once everyone was assembled out of sight of the valley Anastasia whispered instructions. "We need to stop them from opening that gate. At least until the rest of the mission is completed. Lauren, Alisha and I have some magic that we can use to blast the stones and topple them. The rest of you need to keep watch to make certain we aren't disturbed. Ennui, you watch the valley for movement our way. Lissa, take the south section of the ridge. Danny, you take the north, and Kali, you keep watch back toward the main group."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the sentries headed off to their posts Anastasia, Lauren, and Alisha began a soft chant. Ennui could feel the energy ebbing and flowing in sluggish ripples, building, then falling back as they struggled to keep the rhythm. The grey beings ritual built into a frenzy as darkness began to coalesce in the center of the stones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui risked a quick glance back to the three spell casters as they continued their struggle. A small white ball was forming near Alisha. She tried to juggle it in a shaking hand. To Ennui the pattern looked ridiculously simple. She could see no reason why it should give them any trouble at all. Finally, in frustration, she called, "Transfer control. Give me the pattern. You are losing it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You haven't been trained. I can't," Alisha replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Transfer control, now! I can stabilize it. Give me the pattern!" A flash of anger flitted across Alishas face as she tossed the energy ball toward Ennui. It darted to a place above her head and began to pulse and wobble crazily. Sweat popped out on Ennui's face as she fought to stabilize the badly executed pattern. For a few minutes she tried to maintain it as a destructive blast. In the back of her mind she could feel the dark energies as they built to cataclysmic proportions in the circle below. The answer blossomed in a perfect moment of clarity and she shifted and turned the pattern in her hands until it became the perfect counter-point to the dark spell in the valley.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly the blob popped into a perfect ball of light. Looks of wonder formed on Lauren and Alisha's faces as they shifted toward Ennui. They fed energy into it, seeking to strengthen the destructive spell they had started. The ball swelled and began to fly apart as the balancing spell shredded under the onslaught of too much energy. Her face twisted into a silent shriek as she snarled out, "Too much! I have enough!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Energy crackled and sizzled in her hair. Lightning danced from her fingertips to the ground as she raged and fought to restore the perfect balancer. After long minutes the corona around her dimmed and the ball shrunk back to a dancing globe of white. Ennui looked up at it and smiled. With a gentle little push she nudged it toward the dark energies that were gathered around the stones.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Like a ball rolling down a hill the little globe of light started moving slowly, gathering speed as it went. "Get down! The back-blast can kill you!" Alisha yelled. The rest of the team dove for the ground. Ennui stood with her head slightly cocked and a bemused expression as the little ball rolled closer and closer to its target. Mesmerized the rest of the team watched as it gently bumped into the roiling black cloud of energy. There was a firm whump and the black energy vanished. Little grey dust devils danced away from the stones and into the grey beings. Eleven of them dropped soundlessly to the dirt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stood shakily and stared at Ennui, "What have you done?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I balanced the gate with a counter-gate," Ennui replied calmly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali laughed as she came up to the group. "Very impressive, battle-mage."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you, warrior woman."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali was about to continue the banter when a tickle of danger flared along her nerves. She dove into Ennui and brought them both to the ground. A black ball of energy sailed through where they had been moments before. "Alisha, the rest of you, get down, now!" Black energy bursts shot through the air. One clipped Lauren as she dropped slower than the others. "Ennui, can..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, get the rest of them out of here and warn the main team. I'll slow them down a bit and follow right behind you." Ennui's hands moved in a blur as she drew energy and channeled it back at the approaching beings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Patterns blossomed in Kali's head while she scrambled toward the others. Wire frame images formed of the terrain around her with red and blue dots scattered about. One of the blue dots moved where she crawled. Three more marked Alisha, Lauren, and Anastasia, and another marked Ennui. The last close dot showed where Danny was making his way toward Lauren. Grey dots appeared, moving toward them on the ridge. Complex movement plans danced through the image as her mind went off on its own and began running various sets of actions. Tiny little figures danced up and down the hillside, first moving one way then the other, always in a jerky kind of fast motion. In each case some or all of the figures on her side dropped and didn't move again. Suddenly one snapped into focus. The little figures danced a simple pattern and then ran for the train.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As soon as Kali reached Alisha she started the plan in motion for real. "Alisha, you move left and around the clump of trees, come up on their flank. Fire into the center of them. There's a leader in there, the third one up from the back and surrounded by the tallest ones. Don't kill it, just knock it out. As soon as the center figures drop, break around the back of them and run for the recovery team." Next she slid over to Danny where he was tending to Lauren, "Can you move her? If so, start back for the recovery team. We'll be right behind you. Warn them they have half an hour to get things wrapped up. Anastasia, could you go with them and provide covering magic if necessary?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stared at Kali for a moment, before nodding in agreement. "Yes, I'll get them out. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Cover you. Lissa, can you do magic on your own?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She gave a frightened nod, "What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're with me. We are going around to the right, through the bushes over there, and provide cover while Anastasia gets the other two out," Kali pointed where they would go. "There's a small group coming up just to the right of those bushes. In the back is a spell user. I'll keep you safe, but you need to knock all of them out. We don't want to kill them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lissa stared at Kali with wide eyes, "How do you know that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have to trust that I do right now. Maybe I can explain later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Why not kill them? I know how to do that, I think."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It," the words began to form in Kali's head as she spoke them, "It's a balance issue. If we kill then they can kill as well. If we don't they won't either." Kali wanted to stop and think about this new development but there was no time. Quickly they crawled to the bushes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A very few moments later the predicted group of grey creatures emerged from the trees exactly where Kali had indicated. Lissa turned frightened eyes on her and stammered, "I, I don't know if I can do this. I've never tried to knock them out before."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fear chased through Kali's stomach and she wanted to shake her something awful. Instead she reached out and put a hand on her shoulder, "Think back to how you do magic. It had to be terrifying the first time but you did it. You can do it now. I trust you. I can protect you, but if you do this, you will keep more of us alive." Lissa nodded shakily and chanted a few weird sounds almost silently.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stood to the side, watching the advancing line of beings. Lissa cast her first spell before the beings noticed them. The first three dropped soundlessly. Lissa grinned and began readying the next round.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The leader pointed straight at them and began to gesture. His hands were coming up in the final motions when Lissa's spell hit him first. two more dropped, leaving the last two in the line. They stopped uncertainly and stared at Kali. By the time they had decided to advance Lissa had fired her third spell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well done! I knew you could do it. Now we run for the train. I hope Alisha convinced them to get ready."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, I did it!" Lissa laughed almost hysterically. Twenty minutes later they were in sight of the train. It looked like Kali's message had not been taken seriously. The team was still scattered about the site merrily digging and carrying on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What the fuck is this? Weren't you warned? Get on the train right now!" Kali shouted. "Lissa, start warning people you know, get them headed toward the train."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thomas, the official team leader puffed up and bellowed, "Hold it! I am in charge here. I would do nothing to endanger this mission."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then why didn't you listen to Alisha? You know she's an extraction team member."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Her story was preposterous. There has never been any demonic activity on this world."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali drew breath to shout just as Lissa spotted a clot of grey figures breaking from the cover of the trees. "Kali, behind you!" She spun and drew energy. Thomas stood rooted to his spot as an energy bolt shattered the ground in front of him. He staggered back stunned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone, fall back to the train." Kali ran at Thomas and shoved him out of the way as another ball shrieked toward him. It clipped her back. Howling in pain she dropped to her knees.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui burst into view behind the grey figures and let fly at them. Several dropped without a sound. Three of the trailing figures turned to rush her but the main force continued toward the train and the workers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lissa drew energy again and fired into the advancing force. Ennui continued to slam magic into them, dropping them two and three at a time. At last the final group slumped to the ground. Ennui dropped to her knees as Anastasia, Lauren, and Danny emerged behind her. Danny helped her up and wrapped an arm around her for support. He hurried her toward the waiting group.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thomas turned scared eyes on Lissa as the battle wound down. "How could I know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alisha got back. You didn't listen to her," Lissa interrupted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Talk later," Anastasia interrupted over the top of Lissa. "There are more behind us. Too many for just the few of us to stop. Thomas, make up for it. Help Kali back to the train. The rest of you, round up the stragglers. We have maybe five minutes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali slid into unconciousness as Thomas lowered her onto a set of foldered down chairs. Danny moved over to her and began working her injury.</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, Kali..." Danny called as he bent over Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Want sleep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali, come on, I need you to wake up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sleep now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, Kali, I need you awake."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She pried an eye open and looked into the face of Danny. "Prick," she mumbled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. You want to see it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali couldn't stop the giggles that prompted. "Ouch! Now see what you did, you brat?" She had wanted it to be teasing but it came out more like a whine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, now you are waking up. I need to check your shoulder and I didn't want that to be what woke you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali struggled to sit as she asked, "Are we ok? Did we get everyone?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, everyone's ok. You're the worst of the lot."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about Lauren?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Lauren took a hit but it isn't as bad as yours. Ennui's sleeping off whatever she did and Thomas is wanting to apologize as soon as you're ready." Danny's fingers were moving as he spoke and a stab of pain followed. Gently he rolled Kali over and examined it. "Looks like you're going to be ok. No sign of infection or poison. Thank you for back there by the way. You did a great thing getting us all out alive." Swiftly he bandaged the wound and settled her back onto the set of seats that had been rigged as a bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ugh, how long have I been out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Four hours. We arrive at Portal station about an hour from now. And Thomas would like to talk to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I suppose I should give him his chance. It'll only get harder if I put it off. Could you help me sit up? I don't want to be laying down for that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No weakness in front of the troops?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali couldn't tell from his voice if he was serious, mocking or teasing so she just said, "Nope. Must appear super-human at all times. Passing out kind of spoils that though..." She finished through a very shallow laugh which still hurt more than she had hoped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're doing ok with it I think." He finished propping Kali up with a big wad of pillows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thomas hesitantly approached. He leaked nervousness and worry. "I, uh, I'm sorry about all that. I've never seen that kind of attack before. I didn't mean to put anyone in danger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd say it was ok, but it really isn't. You can't take those kinds of chances with people's lives." Kali replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But how was I to know it wasn't hysteria?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thomas," Kali tried to be as diplomatic as I could. "Alisha is an extraction team memeber. Has no one briefed you about this yet? The extraction team only gets sent on missions where a dark forces attack is likely. Our very presence on the mission should have you concerned. When a member of that team raises the alarm, it needs to be taken seriously. No one on the extraction team is known for hysterics in the face of this level of danger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...I didn't..." His eyes turned slightly moist as he tried to explain, "Look, I was in charge because I can coordinate recovery actions pretty well. You're the first person to tell me about an 'extraction team' and who might be on it. I'm not good when it comes to thinking about danger. I'm an archeologist, or at least I was. My skills are knowing what kinds of things are important from an artifact stand point. I didn't sign on for war."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"None of us did. I fear that we are in one whether we want to be or not. Leading in ideal cases is easy. Leading during danger is not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Next time..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't worry about next time. I suspect there'll be a debriefing on this if I know Merris. Things will get worked out and new policies decided after I think."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Danny walked up while they were finishing. He waited patiently until Thomas had returned to his seat before asking, "Are you doing ok? That was a bad burn you picked up. If you start feeling worse, let me know immediately."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes sir, mister doctor sir."</p>
</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He smiled and said, "And don't you forget it missy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia rose when Danny moved away from Kali. She crossed to him and asked softly, "How is she?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Amazingly well considering the injury she sustained."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Would it be ok for me to talk to her?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Should be. If she starts looking distracted or pained come and get me. I'm going to check on Lauren."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How is Lauren?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She'll be ok. Her injury isn't quite as bad as Kali's. She's concious as well. I want to be sure she's stable."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked up as Anastasia approached, "Hey."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey yourself," Anastasia looked around nervously. "I wanted to talk to you..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sorry about that, stepping on your lead like I did."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, that's ok. I'm glad you did, actually."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not doing very well at this. Every extraction has been harder than the last. I keep getting people hurt. It won't be long until I get somebody killed and I won't be able to handle that. I'm resigning from this as soon as we get back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, but why are you telling me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want you to think about taking over. You're the best I've seen. You kept your head, even when injured and you figured out how to get us all back. You don't have to, but there's no one else on the team that can or will lead." Kali stared at her silently while her mind churned over offer. "You don't have to answer now, in fact maybe it's best if you think carefully first." Anastasia settled back into a nearby chair and tried to still the pounding in her heart. She didn't know what she would do if Kali turned her down. A single tear trickled down her face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The request bounced around in Kali's head. Insecurity on insecurity scrambled into place. Thousands of reasons clawed at her to refuse, to walk away as fast as she could. Terror wrapped icy tendrils in the mix. Words of regret and refusal began to assemble themselves in her mind. She turned to tell Anastasia when she caught sight of the tear as it tracked down her face. Her mind blanked. Suspended between thoughts she stared at the slowly crawling drop of water. Reflected in it she saw death, terror, and so much sorrow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Without thought she wrapped Anastasia in a close hug. The flood gates opened and tears poured from her eyes. Anastasia trembled as she fought to not give sound to the sobs wracking her body. Kali held her, a silent and empty rock caught in the storm. "Daughter, please consider what she asks. You have the strength where she does not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ma, Kali," Kali's mind shrieked. "Why? I don't want to be responsible any more. I don't have that strength."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You do my daughter." Images flashed in Kali's mind. Her first battle and then other extractions where she had always protected those around her. The dark goddess faded into view in Kali's mind. "You carry one of my names. You are Destroyer and Mother. You have always been. Would you deny yourself?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, mom," Kali answered with as much sarcasm as she could manage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Insolent child," the dark vision roared through an enraged face. Kali flinched, then stood her ground. A lifetime of resentment against religion of any kind kept her staring back. As she watched the angry face began to shift and move until the dark goddess began to laugh. "Do you have any idea how rare it is for anyone to stand in the face of my rage?" Her image shimmered and shifted until an older version of Kali stood watching her. "Now you truly are a daughter of mine. You are one of few to receive that status."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You made me, mother. When you gave me everything I ever wanted on the first trip into the void. Yet I..." Kali looked away uncomfortably as she started to speak.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know of your hatred of religion. It causes me no concern. Even as you rage against religion and belief you remember me for what I am. It is more pure than many who dedicate their lives to me. Be at peace with yourself." She smiled warmly, "Now I ask that you consider your friend's request. The decision and choice remain yours." The image faded back out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you ok? I didn't mean to embarrass you," Anastasia whispered softly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Huh, oh..." Kali replied vaguely as she tried to pull her mind back to her surroundings. "I'm ok. No worries on my side. How about you? Are you going to be alright?" She held Anastasia as her sobs subsided. "It's ok, I won't tell. Crying doesn't make you weak, though. Even if I agree with you and won't do it in front of others either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia pulled away slightly. Taking the sleeve of her top she scrubbed at her face and eyes. "I know, but I still can't let the others see it." She stood, shook her hair out so it covered most of her face, and hurried to the washroom. She returned a few minutes later looking almost back to normal. "I'll be ok."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"About your offer, I've given it a bit of thought and I accept. What do we need to do to make it official?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let Central Station and Dispatch know when we get back, then tell the few who go on these things. You've already met most of them. They shouldn't be too much trouble, you have proven yourself, especially today." Anastasia stood and continued, "We can talk more once we get back. For now I'm going to try not to think about any of this for the remaining trip back. Danny said you should try and rest, at least I think that was what he was saying in doctor speak."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll try."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Kali talking to her new team - after the transfer and before the influx of the large crew */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia stood nervously in front of the small group. "There is no easy way to say this. I am stepping down from leader of our team. I have been doing this since the begining and I need to take a break. Don't worry, I'm leaving us in good hands and I am not leaving the team, just stepping down from the lead position. I have asked Kali to step up and she has agreed. I am not leaving, I will still be part of the team, just not in charge."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stood up and crossed to the front of the group. "I don't know exactly what to more to add. I don't see our procedures changing other than the transfer of leadership. This is a dangerous thing we do and we are the best. All of you have taught me so much. We need to keep relying on each other and doing what we do best. We are the best."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are the only," Mark mummbled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That may be, but we are still here. We are still alive. So, even if we are the only we are still the best. There are a few things I want to make better. I've told as many rescue mission leaders as I can to find us weapons. We should be looking to do the same every time we go out. The proxy forces won't stay static in what they will use. We can't afford to either. As we have all seen, the pressure is continuing to climb. We are being attacked more often and with stronger forces. Ennui has volunteered to pass on as much magical skill as she can. She and Dementia have agreed to come on those missions where Dementia believes things will be very bad. There are a few others we can call on as well. I don't want to over use them. If we burn them out, we all lose." Kali looked down. When she looked up again her eyes were haunted. "I fear some of us will die. There have already been deaths on some of the rescue missions. Remember, we are their best chance. Our purpose is to keep our friends safe."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* the large crew arrives */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi led the group across the station to a siding where a motley array of rolling stock sat. On closer inspection it was actually linked up to form a train of sorts. Gaudy circus stock from all times in history sat beside other rolling stock that would have looked at home in a post apocalypse world. Several people were working on various coaches, scrubbing, painting, and repairing signs of recent damage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sammi turned to one, a medium build woman with black lips, dark ringed eyes, and short, spiky blond hair, "Anastasia..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sammi, Jemima, what's happening?" She asked watching the group of people following the two women.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Got a present for K... for QBC. Is she around?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"QBC is inside, in the conference car. Ummm, the one with the jumping tigers painted around the windows." Anastasia added at Sammi's puzzled look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Behind her Sammi heard someone mutter, "QBC? What the...?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She smiled as she turned, "Don't ask. You'll find out soon enough. Wait here a few would you?" She sauntered over to the train and entered. Stepping over the gear in the entryway she made her way to the open section in the center of the car. There she found Kali studying an array of drawings.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Jemima, heya." Kali smiled in greeting. "What's the what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Remember that new crew you asked for? We found it for you." Sammi laughed as Kali looked out the window in the direction Sammi pointed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"ALL of them? That's an army, not a crew..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well it's kind of a package deal of one hundred fifty-eight survivors. There were a few more at the start. We found them on a world where the Younger Ones were engaged in their usual game of proxy war. Yeah, I know, normally they'd go off in Sacred Units, but they all want to kick some ass instead. The Lady thought you could help them out. Besides, you've got a pretty big train here and I know you can find more rolling stock if you need it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali shook her head violently, "No, no way. I can't be responsible for them." All the while chanting in her head, 'Mother, no, please, no.'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Daughter, yes you can, you must. They need this as much as you need.' The dark voice of power rolled in her head.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'Mother...' Kali thought in agony. she dropped her head briefly in defeat, "Ok, let me tell my crew and I'll be out. Tell Anastasia crew meeting inside, stat."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once everyone was around the table Kali began, "Looks like we have the crew we needed." She waved toward the window, "Maybe even more than we needed. Sammi and Jemima just brought them over."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do they know how things work yet?" "How many are there?" Questions flew from around the table until Kali waved them into silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hold up a bit," she smiled to take the sting off. "I don't know the what of it yet. There are one hundred fifty-eight of them. I have no idea what they know of Eternia and Death City. We're going to have to assimilate them into our team and find out. They all came from the same place. Another place of the Proxy Wars. They want to fight back. We have to teach them about the balance of things before we let them into combat." She stared down at her hands for along while. With a weary sigh she continued, "We'll divide them into teams and get them settled. We know the routine, it's just a bigger crowd this time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You ok boss?" Anastasia asked as she watched Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. I will be, just not at the moment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can take care of this if you want..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, I need to make sure they know who's Queen Bitch in Charge from the start. Once we get them split up you can each take care of your new team. Ah hell, it's not like I haven't done this..." She stood and untied her boiler suit top from around her waist. She shrugged her arms into the sleeves and zipped it up over her crop top. Properly armored up she strode to the carriage door and out into the sunshine. The rest of her crew followed a few paces behind. As she walked they saw her assemble her public mask.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When she reached the crowd she began, "So, I hear there's a few of you who want to kick demon ass out here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah!" "Right on!" The shouts and cheers rolled back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good!" She smiled at them. "We are going to break you up into groups and explain what I am about to tell you more completely, but first I want to give you the basic what of Death City. In the guide books, if there were any, it would be listed as, 'Death City. The Ageless. City of Power. East of Heaven and west of Hell, it stands at the center of Eternia, the realm between.'."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A woman shouted from the center of the crowd, "Well that sounds all mystical and shite, but what does it really mean? Where are we and what happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'I thought I could write better than that, how cliche, the token heckler from the crowd to force exposition...' She smiled ruefully at herself and answered, "Death City is a place Between. It is not the land of the living nor is it the land of the dead. The Death City Charter is to recover the beauty of the Realms before it is destroyed by war and disaster. These things of beauty are then placed back into Realms that are in need of them, that will treasure and use them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Our friends died getting us here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know and that happens all too often of late. That is the usual way of arriving here though. Your friends weren't the only ones to die. They just chose to go to the Havens. It seems the rest of you petitioned for a way to strike back and that is what I can offer you. There are a few rules that we have to follow though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Rules, bah. I don't need this shit." A large man scoffed from the back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're right. You can go whenever you wish. I'm not here to recruit you. I can offer you a chance to strike back, but by all means, go find other arrangements if you can. Anyone else who isn't interested can go with you." There was a smattering of laughter from the crowd.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali waited patiently while the crowd looked around at itself. When no one moved the woman in front called again, "So, you going to continue, or what?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was thinking or what. Are you interested in listening then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are," the woman said as she stared at those nearest to her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"For those of you who might be interested here's the quick what of it. The charter of Death City, where you are right now, is this: We rescue beauty from the ruins of the Proxy wars. We are not to directly interfere with or attack the combatants of either side. If we are attacked then we can fight back. If Death City draws first blood then our people pay a price in the same level of damage or death as what they caused. That said we are an Extraction Team. We go in and rescue the rescuers when things go wrong. So we often fight since we usually aren't called unless Death City people have already been hurt or killed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And who might you be?" the large man challenged.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're still here? I thought you weren't interested." The man had the grace to look slightly embarrassed. "I'm the Queen Bitch in Charge. Who might you be?" Kali replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali heard several muttered "QBC...no wonder..." comments from the crowd as well as a few more laughs before the large man answered. "I am Petrov."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well then Petrov, are you in or out?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to strike back, so I'm in. For now. And what kind of name Queen Bitch anyway? Don't you have a real name?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali smiled enigmatically, "Yes, and those who remain will get to know it. There are a couple more rules for this team that I should mention right now. We don't waste the living on the dead. If one of us dies on a mission we don't try to go back for the body. Also the mission is the critical item. If we are rescuing another team we finish that first. So if some of us get cut off, we are on our own until the primary objective is complete. We won't risk anyone outside our own in a bad situation."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali let the mutterings and comments fly for several minutes before she held up her hand. When the crowd didn't notice right away Anastasia gave a piercing whistle, "Listen up people."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali waited while Anastasia held fingers to lips to give another whistle if it was needed. Once the crowd had wound down to silence Kali asked, "Now that you know the basic what of it, who is still in? Those of you planning to stay will be split into small groups and assigned a crew chief. They will explain the details and answer your questions." She waited as the group shuffled their feet and watched to see if any would leave. She was surprised when none did. "Ok then, count off by numbers, one through ten, then start again. There will be fifteen groups of you."</p>
