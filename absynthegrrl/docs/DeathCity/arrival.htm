<p class="pagecaption">Dreaming in Death City</p>
<p class="pagecaption">part - Arrival</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It had been another bad day at work. Kali had arrived late as usual, only this time the boss was watching. With a shake of his head he had escorted her to his office where he had given her an official warning about continuous lateness. At the end he had presented the papers for her to sign. Bold on the top were the words "First Warning". As she was leaving his office he added, "By the way, lose the cape. You're too old to be playing goth dress-up. It's not professional." She bit back a reply but couldn't stop the cold dagger stare as she turned to leave. Behind her he leaned back in his chair and grinned at her stiff posture.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stalked to her desk and set about the meaningless tasks that filled her days. A little surfing of the internet and programming of the work flow system that no one would ever use anyway. By the time she was ready to leave the watery sunshine had turned to a cold Seattle drizzle. She climbed slowly onto the bus, grateful for the unprofessional cloak that had kept her mostly dry.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bus was packed full of soggy bodies by the time it reached Broadway. She had to push and thread her way to the nearest door and yell for the driver to open it again. She stepped out into the crowds and bustle of the brightly lit street. Neon flashed and pulsed, the overhead cables snapped and popped as other buses crawled along the street. Voices were raised in shouts of greeting and conversations as she tried to find space on the sidewalks to move. Carefully she eased her way through the throng to her favorite East Indian restaurant. She settled into a booth near the door, one of the few still empty, and placed her order. She had just leaned back to relax when the door opened again. She glanced up just in time to see her ex-partner Anne entering with her new boyfriend.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They were laughing and carrying on like they had been together for months instead of a couple of weeks. As they walked by Anne turned to him and said in a loud whisper, "There she is. God, I can't believe I stayed with that depressed psycho chick as long as I did. And that's not the worst of it, let me tell you..." As they walked away Kali dropped enough money for her order plus a healthy tip and fled back into the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For once she was grateful for the rain. It gave her an excuse to pull the hood up on her cloak as she slipped into the shadows of the nearest alley. Eyes burning with unshed tears she slipped through the dark to the next street back, away from the lights and crowds of Broadway. Head bowed from more than the ever present drizzle she shuffled along thinking of the last few days. With a heavy sigh she slipped back onto Broadway to walk past the stairway to nowhere, the last remains of a long demolished building. Just visible through the now stronger rain, it curved up to Harvard Street and then swept up to the missing building.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It tugged at her like a half remembered dream and slowed her footsteps. Her gaze was so focused on the shadowed bulk of the stairs that she almost didn't see one of the chains holding the fence together was gone. Spurred by her depressed not caring she shoved and pulled the fence sections apart enough to squeeze through. Slowly she climbed the rotting concrete steps until she stood at the top where the building should have been.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rain dripped slowly from her cloak as she stared into the darkness as if waiting for the building to materialize in front of her. For a flickering moment she thought she saw it shimmering in the shadows, then it was gone. A faint popping sound intruded on her awareness and twitched her head toward Broadway. Nothing seemed out of place.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned to look at Harvard Street. A spill of warm yellow light pulled her gaze to an old trolley parked nearby. Curios, she slowly walked to the fence on Harvard and pushed her way through the gap she found there. She carefully approached the trolley looking for markings or signs. Near the door was an elegant insignia with "DCM-Eternia" blazoned on it. Warm yellow lantern light spilled from the windows. She was about to turn away when the doors opened and a voice called out, "A cold, wet night out, isn't it lady?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That it is," she replied, peering in at the driver. He was dressed in a worn long tailed coat and black top hat that would have looked more at home in a horse cab than the trolley. "What insignia is this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Death City Metro, lady. Don't ye remember? Ye requested a ride on the Death City Metro. I am here to offer it to ye."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She froze as her mind shut off for long moments. "That...that was just..." She stopped and sucked in a deep breath and thought again of the endless tomorrows stretching off into boredom. For long moments she hesitated, trapped by fear of the unknown, then with a shake of her head she decided. "Wicked!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh no lady, we be not wicked. Death City be neutral in the Proxy Wars."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, um..." Kali groped around for an appropriate exclamation and finally gave up. "I'm just very glad to see you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She moved to step aboard only to stop as he said, "That be not good enough, lady. Ye must answer yeah or nay."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The words came to her from somewhere deep in the past, from dreams and stories. "I enter freely and of my own will." The words hung in the air for a moment, ancient and powerful.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Then enter and be welcome aboard the Death City Railroad, lady..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali," she replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome Kali and Blessed Be." The exchange had the feel of a spell or ritual because once it was done he reverted back to the friendly trolley driver. "Take a seat anywhere ye like. The ride be a bit rough at first when we be leavin' the Realms." As he spoke he set the tram in motion. Within moments it lifted from the street and climbed into the clouds. Kali watched spell-bound as Seattle faded into the distance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She sat back in the worn high backed leather seat and wondered what was happening. Part of her expected to wake shortly and find herself huddled on the stairs to nowhere. Another part fervently prayed this was really happening. Thoughts zipped through her head as she remembered the emails to her friend Jack about the stories he had written. In one of his latest he had asked if she had wanted to take a trip to Death City. "No, this can't be..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It slipped out quietly but the coachman heard it anyway. "What was that, Lady Kali?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ummm...nothing..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sammi and Jemima asked that someone come for ye. They said a friend told them ye'd be wantin' te visit. Now settle back, we've a bit of journey left. It'll be about an hour to the Portal and then another hour from the Portal to the city. Ye can ask after it at the Adam n' Eve. Ye be expected."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She expected to stay wide awake with thoughts bouncing around her head. Instead she felt her eyes drift closed and she faded into sleep moments later.</p>

</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The driver's voice slowly called her back awake, "We have arrived Lady Kali." Outside the tram wrought iron gas lamps lit a wide street. A sweep of cobbled path swept from the street to the brooding dark doors of a large cathedral. A smaller stone path lead off to the right side. "Welcome to Death City, the capital of Eternia. They be waiting for ye at the Adam and Eve pub. Follow the path around the edge of the cathedral and ye’ll find it soon enough. Tell the landlord’s daughter yer a friend of Jemima." Still she hesitated until he said again, "Go on lady, they're expecting ye."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Carefully she climbed down into the rainy night. A steady drizzle kept her company as she slowly walked down the path. At least some things were familiar. The pub was right where the driver had said. A pool of gaslight illuminated the worn oak door and the sign hanging above. Age darkened brick work formed the bulk of the building. Warm light spilled from the windows casting pools on the outside tables and herb gardens near the entry.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stood in the shadows for long moments staring at the building. Finally she shrugged, gathered her courage and strode to the door. She pulled it open onto a warm, cheery but tiny common room with a large fire burning at one end. Conversations washed over her as she stared in at the crowd. Tables were pushed together ranndomly to fill the available space. A server wove her way skillfully through the crowded chaos, leaving food and beer while efficiently removing the empties.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cautiously she stepped in and let the door close. Moving carefully she tried to thread her way to the imposing bar directly in front of her and the giant holding forth from behind it. She was making headway when a tangle of flying skirts and a happy voice interrupted her progress.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kali! It is you, isn't it? We knew you were coming. I'm so glad to meet you! Come on, let me get you a place and something to drink. I'll put you at Sammi and Jemima's table. Follow me. It's down in the vault." Immediately the girl was winding her way through the crowd with practiced ease. Kali followed her through another common room to a spiral stairway of brick leading down to an enormous brick chamber below the inn. Soon she had Kali planted at a small table to the side of a large hearth. "Don't worry as a friend of Sammi and Jemima it’s ok to be at their table. I'm Josephine by the way, but everyone calls me Jo. Big Joe, my da, is behind the bar. What can I get you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali, still stunned by it all, answered hesitantly, "Something dark..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dark?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Umm dark and heavy. You know, something you could walk on and not leave tracks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Got it! One Murphy’s Imperial coming up." Jo skittered away in another flurry of skirts leaving Kali staring bemusedly into the room. A few minutes later she was back with a mug of beer and a small plate of bread and cheese. "Here, and I brought food in case you're hungry." She perched on the other chair before continuing, "Now, I'm sure you have questions..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, but the first is easy, how do I settle up for the beer?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't worry about settling up. Sammi asked us to take care of you, said the Realms hadn't been kind to you of late. They'll be here tomorrow night and apologize for not being here. They had to make an emergency run and all. There’s a bed upstairs. When you're ready just grab me and I'll take you up. You can get food here in the morning. Now I need to get back to it. If you need anything just wave me over..." With a smile she was gone back into the crowd.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali sat back in the comfortable chair and sipped the thick, rich  dark liquid, full of hidden flavor and the subtle hints of an ageless tradition of brew making. Thoughts whirled around in confusion. Thoughts of where she had come from, questions of how she had arrived, and questions about what to do next. Should she be angry or frightened by the taking of her? As she sat and sipped stout she decided not. Nothing had been holding her to Seattle anyway and she had always wanted an adventure. Besides, the final choice had been hers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shaking her head to clear it she raised a hand and waved Jo over. She raised her mug and looked at it longingly before smiling. "Another coming right up." Jo answered her silent plea.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Got a moment?" Kali asked as Jo spun the new mug onto the table.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure. You want to know how it all works and how you got here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes...?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It’s the most asked of course. This place exists outside the Realms. It is our commission to rescue the beauty and art of the places in the Realms when destruction threatens it. That’s the easy part. None of us know exactly how we are chosen and transported to here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Shhh, it is not asked nor is it answered except among close friends. The Lady determines and selects, that's all any really know of it. How’s the beer and food? You doing ok otherwise? Sammi and Jemima can maybe fill in a little more for you tomorrow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was thinking I'd finish this drink and free up the table."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Take your time. There are a few tables in here that are always waiting for certain people. This is one. The large group in the center is for the Temple Heath crowd. They're here every night, as are the Central Station people over there." She waved first to a loud happy group in the center of the room and then to a smaller group across from them. "This table is always here for Sammi, Jemima, and now you if you'd like." Jo stood and returned to the bar while Kali looked around the room again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She slowly finished her second stout then motioned Jo over again. "I think I'd like to fall into that bed now, if you don't mind..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, follow me." Once again Jo threaded them through the pressing the common room, stopping to chat with this or that person along the way. At last she guided Kali through an almost hidden door in one of the support columns. She led the way up the narrow spiral stair inside, down a hall and stopped in front of a door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside was a small room tucked in under the eaves. Lacy curtains covered a small window and a fire burned in the grate chasing the chill from the room. A large bed sat below the window with its covers turned back. "Sleep well Kali. I'll see you in the morning."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The morning sun roused her as it spilled in through the curtains. Blinking sleepily she tried to remember where she was. It came back to her as she pulled the curtains aside to see a small garden below. Smiling she slipped out of bed and prepared to face the day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She had expected the pub to be empty, instead most of the tables were filled with people eating. She ended up back at Sammi and Jemima's table in the vault. A server approached soon after she was seated with a menu and water. She ordered and watched the vault rapidly fill with people as she ate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fortified by a hearty pub style breakfast she stepped out into the early morning sunshine. The cathedral drew her eye as the morning light rendered it even more beautiful. She stood for long moments admiring it. Reluctantly she turned away and made her way to the street. She began to walk, drawn by something she couldn't identify. As she walked she realized how quiet the city was. Bird song, bicycle bells, and scraps of conversation drifted past her. There were no automobile sounds or smells and she didn't see any parking lots crowding up against the cathedral.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just past the cathedral, on the inland side of the street, she saw a dark, brooding building crouching at the point of a triangular block. Her gaze was drawn by the heavy stonework and intricate carvings on its face.  A small sward of overgrown grass lay between the street and the doors with a cracked walkway cutting through it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Curiosity pulled her up the broken and twisted walk to the yellow tape spider-webbed across the carved wooden doors. She could still make out the faded black letters of, "Crime Scene - Do Not Cross". Large brass lion handles glowered at her from behind the tape and stone gargoyles stared down from the roof above.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Quiet waiting oozed from the building both pulling and repelling her. She slowly reached through the tape and pulled the left door open. The rusty hinges squealed in protest as she dragged the door open. Hesitantly she entered, almost as if the building had to reach out and drag her in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dusty colored light fell from a stained glass window high overhead illuminating a circle of orange cones with more yellow tape. Other pools fell on the wide stone stairwell circling its way around the open circular atrium. The hand of the building pulled her more strongly now. She walked to the steps and began climbing. By the time she reached the top she was almost running. She skidded into the fourth floor hallway and stopped confused.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Higher, she had to get higher. Searching she finally found the small oak door with a rose covered ankh carved into it. It opened to a narrow circular wrought iron stairway that drew her higher. Scrambling, almost falling in her haste she clawed her way up and into an ante-room. To her left was a circular room almost completely covered in windows. In front of her was an open space and then another wrought iron circular staircase rising to a higher floor. To her right was a hall leading off in two directions and a door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The view of the cathedral drew her into the circular room. Brightly colored throw pillows covered most of the rich Oriental rug centered in the room. Near the edges she could just see the hardwood floor underneath. A large, deep easy chair was pulled up to the windows and placed so it had a perfect view of the cathedral. An ornate chandelier hung over it with its wicks ready for the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still the need to go higher pulled her back to the stairs. They emerged into a round tower room, above the rest of the roof line and completely surrounded in windows. A huge four poster bed dominated the room, it’s blood red velvet curtains drawn back to reveal the black bed spread with a single red rose embroidered on it. It’s uprights and crosspieces were intricately woven wrought iron traceries. Lace curtains framed the windows while thicker ones brooded between them, waiting to close out the light, or hold it in at night. Toward the back of the buliding were  patio doors leading out onto a small balcony.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A teak wardrobe stood to the side of the stairs and a large trunk crouched at the foot of the bed. The cavern of the wardrobe barely noticed the meager stock of clothing within. A black cat suit hung next to three dark green flight suits, two pairs of jeans, and a couple of folded t shirts rested on the shelf. A worn pair of motorcycle boots with metal shin guards stood propped in a corner.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The trunk was also nearly empty, holding only a small oilskin pouch with a well crafted set of lock picking tools, a coil of climbing rope and a small bag of pitons with a hammer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The patio doors opened onto a small balcony that overlooked the roof line of the building. It looked down on a triangular section of roof that had been made into a garden. One either side were doors into the wings of the building that attached to the lower circular room she had just left.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Curiosity dragged her away from the views and back down to the hallway. Halls led off to the left and the right. The door swung open to reveal a sky lit bathroom with an enormous claw footed tub. Ivy wove itself around the windows above the tub and up to a latticework near the skylight. She could just make out the railing of the balcony above through the twined leaves. A thick forest green throw rug masked the orange, red, and brown tile of the floor. Under the dust, fluffy purple towels hung expectantly on a brass rail, waiting invitingly for the next bather. Beyond the window was the roof garden. Bright flowers bloomed in the early morning light and a small fountain played in the center of an open area.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Turning back to the passageways she turned left and rounded a corner. The left wall was a series of windows looking out into the garden area and part way down on the right was another door. She stopped and opened it. Across from her were more windows. Mirrors lined the other three walls and a waist high brass rail encircled the room. A small stereo stood on a wheeled stand in the left corner near the windows. An impulse moved through her and soon she was half dancing, half just moving around the room. Small clouds of dust puffed up from her feet as she slowly warmed up. Somehow her muscles knew how to move, far better than they ever had before. Even the stiffness in her left shoulder was less noticeable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once her glance fell across herself in the mirror and she cringed at her reflection. She hadn't realized just how much weight she'd gained over the last year. The pudgy baby face her mom had given her was even more noticeable than it had been. So was the added thickness around her middle. Just like her mom she stacked it on in her stomach rather than her hips and thighs. Quickly she turned so she was looking out the windows as she moved.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took a while before curiosity pulled her out of movement and to the door at the end of the hall. Beyond it was a large study with an oak partners desk holding court in the room. The wall to her right was covered in bookshelves. The other three walls alternated between more shelves and windows revealing the garden, the back street, and the side street. The buildings beyond were slightly lower than the one she was in and showed jagged roof lines and intriguing oddities of angle. On the desk was a computer and keyboard. There was a door to the right of the one she entered through that led to the garden.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She crossed to it and stepped into the garden area. She wandered among the plants for a while, marveling at how healthy they were even though they showed signs of neglect. Someone had put a lot of work into the arrangement and care at one time. There was another door, almost directly across from the study that opened into a cavernous kitchen. A large brass rack hung from the ceiling in the center of the room and supported trailing ivy and large kitchen utensils. Beneath the rack was a butcher-block central island with a knife rack mounted on the side. An industrial size gas stove dominated the wall to her right and was backed by windows facing the road behind the building. On the wall to her left was an enormous icebox standing next to a door. On it was a poster of a ballet dancer in mid movement and the phrase, "Eat Right, Respect Your Body, Dance Forever". The door opened onto a hallway leading back into the rest of the apartment. It passed an empty room and emerged on the other side of the bathroom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Normally she would tell everyone she wasn't the cleaning type, in fact she'd sum herself up as ‘domestically impaired’, but there she was, scrubbing that place for all she was worth. She couldn't have told anyone why, it was more of a compulsion than anything else. Most of the day passed as she swept, scrubbed, dusted, and straightened. At last she collapsed on the pillows in the living area.</p>

</br>
<p class="regtxt5">It was dark when hunger finally pulled her awake. Only a few lights were visible from her windows, along with the glow of Central Station in the distance. A feature of the city she remembered from John’s descriptions. She prepared herself for a long, groping descent through the dark stairwells of the building, but when she stepped back into the gloom it seemed less dark than it should have been. In no time at all she had reached the street and had turned her steps toward the Adam and Eve and food.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jo guided her to the table near the fire once more then returned with a huge plate of food and a Murphy’s Imperial. As Jo turned to go Kali asked her how she could find out who owned a place, blushing all the while. "Why, did you find something you like?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Nodding excitedly she replied, "There’s this wonderful place near the cathedral, but it looks like no one has been there in a very long time...I'd like to find the landlord, or someone who could tell me more about it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Big Joe knows the most about the places around here. I'll send him over in just a bit."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Soon Big Joe wandered over and settled in. "You're going to stay then?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh..." His question caught her off guard. "I, yeah, I thought I'd stay. I guess, I mean, do I have to go back? I hoped I could stay..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You could, yes," A strange look flickered across his face so fast she wasn't sure she actually saw it. "As Sammi explained it to us you were given a chance to visit. You are free to go back any time."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Panic clawed its way up her throat as she thought again of her boring endless future in the Realms. "Do I have to go back? Could I stay and see if I like it here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Certainly you can stay. The Lady won't turn you away, else she wouldn't have let you come in the first place. Now I hear you've been out looking for a place. What’s the matter? Isn't our hospitality good enough for you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She started and stuttered until she saw the twinkle in his eye and the grin spreading over his face. "Umm, it’s wonderful...it’s just...well, I've seen this place that’s even more wonderful, it’s perfect, and I'd like to know who owns it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And were is this ‘dream spot’?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In the building by the cathedral, the one with the police tape..." she slowed to a stop as she saw his face grow thoughtful.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't believe I know that one. Were is it again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It’s right across from the cathedral, just down the street from here. It’s not hard to spot, it’s the tallest building around except for the cathedral."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could you describe it for me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She began to try and describe it in words, "triangular, sort of, it fills the lot between the two roads leading away from the cathedral, beautiful gothic stonework surrounds the main entry foyer, which is in the point of the triangle. Inside is a large entry area with a circular stairwell going up and stained glass windows throwing rich colors on old marble..." she paused, trying to conjure up the picture of it in her head.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Joe watched her with a strange look as she struggled for the words. "What did you do before you came here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Huh, what?" Concentration broken she stared at him. "Why?" Puzzled by his intense and serious look she started, "I programmed computers, fixed broken electronic things, wrote.."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You wrote...?" he said stunned.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, not to be published really, more as a way of getting at things in my head. Why??" He collapsed into the chair across from her looking pale.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Writers have more power here than most. They can make things happen, even if they normally might not." It was her turn to look afraid. "No, it’s no where near omnipotence or anything like that, but things Change when Writers are around, a Writer can have great influence over non critical things. For example I'd be willing to bet you brought that building here. The spot you are talking about used to be a row of small houses. No one lived there. They were just what was nearby. I wouldn't worry about moving in, it’s yours, you called it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She reached a shaky hand toward her stout, then took a LONG pull and sat back, stunned. A train whistle sounded far in the distance, "If you have more questions ask Sammi or Jemima, I think that’s their train, just wait to be sure they haven't had a hard time this trip..." He was recovering quickly, "Oh, one other thing, you'll end up looking like you see yourself in your dreams here. It'll be especially true for you, just remember that..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Chills still chased through her nerves, "Could you have Sammi and Jemima’s favorite drinks here waiting for them? I seem to recall it was Newcastle?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That’s right, coming right up, ms. Writer!" he gave her a shaky grin, beginning to recover from his shock.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After he left she chewed on what he'd said, vowing quietly to be very careful from now on. The thoughts of the previous night returned to chase through her mind again. Big Joe’s revelations added to the sense of stepping into a weird dream and not being certain it wasn't really a nightmare, thinly disguised as pleasant. She was well into her second Murphy’s by the time the door opened and two women walked in. It wasn't until they stopped, looked, and headed her way that she knew they were Sammi and Jemima. She sat and waited uncertainly as they approached....
