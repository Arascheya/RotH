<p class="sectioncaption">Things to remember throughout</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* non-Perforce resources now reside on the DVD_Image disk under the Stories_Data->DeathCity directory */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* add the snarly, desiring of nasty side to kali - remember she is the closest avatar */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* author note */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Avoid sappy overly great endings fan-fic writers seem to thrive on - these are real people with real problems - think JMS or JW when writing them</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali understands the concept of it is about the person next to you. Her reason for joining the Extraction Teams has to do with wanting to help people she knows. It makes more sense to her than fighting over small chunks of ground.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">could have her mention anti-depressant experience if an opportunity presents itself</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali has a love of roses - her favorites being red, black, and purple, although blue is nice as well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">remember the lock picks - she needs to use them now and again</p>
<p class="regtxt5">remember climbing tools - she needs to go climbing once in a while - although with the morphing happening to her she might not need as many tools anymore to successfully climb, remember she really likes to climb the cathedrals in Death City and the city</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/kyrnan.htm">Kyrnan</a> - always over-sleeps</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_Alone_Complex">Stand Alone Complex</a> - look at this concept for use in the <a href="dev/d_extract.htm">Extraction</a> <a href="dev/d_org_chart.htm">Teams</a> as part of the command structure. it won't apply straight up because the teams are not unified in all purposes, however, it will apply in part.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">story arc possibilities:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali starts nervous and scared from her time in the realms</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She becomes stronger and more confident, based on her new self, her ability to fight and survive, and her aspect as avatar</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She falls in love with Merris, but realizes they can't live together, as much because of Merris obsession with Dispatch as Kali's fear of losing herself in a live-in relationship</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She realizes she is not invincible as the extractions get harder and she has to learn not to be cocky</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She realizes just how hard it is to be the queen bitch in charge after the 150 are added to her team</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She falls in love with Petrov - which scares her a great deal. She never thought she could desire a man the way she does him. The physicality of their love-making, the safety in the arms of someone so much bigger, and the fact she won't break him conspire against her. It forces a new evaluation of her relationship with Merris as well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The burden of command decisions weighs on her, especially after she has to deliberately send people to their destruction as things get even worse.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<p class="regtxt5">interactions:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali and Petrov - love and intensity - they are both intense. Kali will need to learn that a disagreement isn't the end of everything. Petrov will need to learn to appologize unless he wants to walk away</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kail and Merris - love and an odd kind of distance - brought about by their paths and obsession. Will need to reconcile Kali's need for sex, with boys, other girls, and the oddity of Petrov.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">general data:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">pregnancy - no - death city is for healing of existing beings, not creation of new</p>
<p class="regtxt9">aging - based on desires of individual - more common among younger members</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Eternia is as old as the gods. Each race that has ever existed has a section in Eternia that is separated from every other. each section has it's own Portal to preserve the separation. There may be some type of cross-talk, enough for suspicions, but not enough for confirmation. It is possible Head of Dispatch knows or suspects more than the rest. The Mystery Woman knows since she is tapped into the authoring of the place.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">For the times before the rail technology of the sections we are familiar with there were other ways to get through the Portal and into the sections of Eternia. Mystery Woman and Tabitha will begin to see some of these as they follow long abandoned sidings and lines that lead near to the older places. Always the missions are the same, save beauty, heal the soul weary.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Could draw on some of the other human areas as the war increases in ferocity if need be.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">thoughts on the upcoming conflicts</p>
<p class="regtxt5">several of those that don't fit in Eternia could be playing the demons, feeding them inside info and data so they will attack Eternia, possibly revenge motivated. the demons see the possibility of getting tech from Eternia that could give them an edge up on the light side</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the light side resents the Lady stepping outside and basically rejecting their perfect ways. they are the true foe in the up-coming conflicts. they have two reasons for attacking Eternia, the first is to bring the Lady into line, the second is to get some of the tech for themselves, to keep the demons from having an edge.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the demons actually capture an Eternia train and gain access to Eternia, wreaking havoc and destruction as they come. they are brought down by the tech of Eternia. this is Eternia's edge in any conflict with the powers forces, they know and can wield tech that is as powerful as the magics the powers can field.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the demon direct attack is more of an ill-conceived thing. the actual transfer of tech is happening through the insiders</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the Lady does not believe in "correcting" the thoughts of those in Eternia. Eternia is a place for healing and self growth, not a lock step place to a particular viewpoint like the places of the powers of the proxy wars. as a result those who don't fit in are left to find their own way out. in the case of a few they take it more personally and turn traitor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">need to walk a fine line with this. on one hand Eternia is a place of safety, so they won't directly hurt anyone. they will also be feeding data to demon groups that aren't directly involved in the frontal assault. although data will have bled to those groups, enough that they can actually capture an Eternia train.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the end result is the demons are able to defeat the angels in several key battles. this further enrages the angels and leads directly to their assault on the Lady.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">when the angels try to call the Lady to join the light how many in Eternia would switch sides and desire her to actually do so?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">final ending - re-establish the truce with a new balance of power in the proxy wars. Lady and Eternia remain free and autonomous</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the Lady doesn't have the power to go head to head with the entirety of the proxy war group, she has to enforce her autonomy through skill and wisdom. one of the negotiating points is the ability of Eternia personnel to mix magic and tech, another is the ability to expose the proxy war for what it is. leverage this into the greatest level Eternia has against the proxy gods</p>
<p class="regtxt5">concepts on railroad</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the magic track construction in the Realms requires some type of magical device that can only do a certain amount of track before requiring recharge. additional units can be brought however they figure in to the total car limit of any train</p>
<p class="regtxt5">as Eternia begins to field weapons systems, they also have to be calculated into the train car count.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">want to keep the images of the large city with it's parks and such, the city is a collision of varying styles and cultures, crashing together like waves in a turbulent sea.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">any time there is no medic along on a mission there is greater risk - particularly for the Extraction Teams.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">consider splitting into more than one team as time goes along</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The coming together of various elements is necessary for the ending of the conflict - <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/alice.htm">Alice</a> is needed to read the background of various artifacts, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/kali.htm">Kali</a> is needed as avatar, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/merris.htm">Merris</a> is needed for dispatch coordination, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/ennui.htm">Ennui</a> and <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/dimentia.htm">Dementia</a> for visions, <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/tabitha.htm">Tabitha</a> for her ability to see tactically, similar to <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/kali.htm">Kali</a>, the <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/the_author.htm">Mystery Woman</a> and <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/teresa.htm">Teresa</a> for their access to <a href="../../gm_resources/places/eternia/repository.htm">The Repository</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">transfer to Death City occurs april-june of 1995 for Kali - some time in Seattle before RL meeting of Ellie - arbitrarily set as friday, 5 may 1995</p>
<p class="regtxt9">any RL events after that cnnot be used in Death City if keep to that line...</p>
<p class="regtxt9">- she has transformed some in her transfer - she now needs to deal with being younger, in great shape, and more attractive than she thought she was - this needs to be a head fuck - sometimes she feels great about it, sometimes it terrifies her - she still isn't crazy about attention</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* need someone who is socially autistic - didn't want to be either human gender role */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Silent Woman and Theresa have been following "abandoned" tracks deeper into Eternia and come across interesting things, including the station for the Repository - does Merris find out or know about as part of Dispatch? */</p>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>

</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">Things to consider revising</p>
<p class="regtxt5">REVISION - more time between AfterVoid section and Absynthe - need more time for things to develop in Kali's situation - not so much about Merris, but other aspects</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ennui and Dementia will become more interwoven in the extractions as things heat up. Day to day management of the Cathouse will be passed to one or more of the regular staff. They will still make the overall decisions as needed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Anastasia's tale - need to update Dementia's memories of London with the new data - Mere/Ange is in the picture far earlier than indicated.</p>

</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* - ideas to work with.. - */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* while driving */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">visions of the space between worlds. The clacking of the wheels as she stormed between the worlds. Starlight and darkness.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The sounds of metal pounded through the cab as kali drove hard toward the disaster.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* apartment gardens */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She sat in the garden as the sun set. Red light filtered through the foliage and splashed on the hidden sculptures. Soon the fire flies started dancing in the flowers. Silver splashed the garden as the moon rose, full and bright over the cathedral. Pale calla blossoms shone from behind the dark leaves.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">place in the garden on the roof where she goes when overloaded - when she needs to get the spinning in her head to settle back down - maybe a comfortable stone chair nestled back into the foliage and flowers, maybe covered by a glass and wrought iron structure, maybe not</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Garden on roof - plants in a riot of life, heavy gothic garden sculpture and a fountain, fire flies in the evenings, a green house like structure sticking into it with doors to it, inside ivy climbs and twines around the structure, flowers that want a bit more shade grow, including calla lilies and similar flowers - buried in the depths of this is a comfortable stone chair - this could oddly mutate once Merris takes up residence</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* misc images to use */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">age blackened beams, dark iron, faded brick</p>
<p class="regtxt5">acrid metallic tang of heat tortured metal</p>
<p class="regtxt5">quiet stillness of the bone yard with sunlight leaking in through the gaps in the walls and dust motes dancing in the air and in the puffs of dust from her feet</p>
<p class="regtxt5">sparkling green, cloudy chartreuse in the candle light</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the splash and drip of water through the sugar and spoon</p>
<p class="regtxt5">river moonlight silver flowing past in the night below the window where they sit</p>
<p class="regtxt5">flickering candle flame dominating vision and concentration as the absinthe works its magic</p>
<p class="regtxt5">drum fires in the park, laughing people clustered in groups, music and dancing, colorful tents and wagons</p>
<p class="regtxt5">friendly arguments drifting on the night breezes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">tales of dangers, places, times all visited on missions</p>
<p class="regtxt5">cold, silver moonlight through vines and tangles in her garden on a full moon. sitting under a curtain with moonlight and shadow falling all around, string out at the lillies and other night-blooming flowers, memories haunting her</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* dreams and hauntings</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dreams haunt Kali - fear of people, fear of performance</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In building dreams of rape and death in a back construction area</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Died in foyer, walked/crawled from the back, was the second incident - before it was a first rape. Did it happen all in one life?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* thoughts on her rescue train */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Rolling stock for extraction unit should be very mad max feeling - formed of bits and pieces from here, there, everywhere - Circus train cars and others</p>
<p class="regtxt5">another possibility - add a copy of Merris dispatch station to the office at Kali's place. she could surprise Merris, or ask her ahead of time...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">descent into basement and construction areas of building could trigger her nightmares</p>
<p class="regtxt5">have Kali show Merris how to drive Leopardess. it will take a while for her to convince Merris to learn.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* general note */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">make it romantic but also remember there are ghosts in each of their pasts that will always haunt them. this isn't a Hallmark movie where everything is magically right at the end...there are opportunities for Hallmark moments though...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Absynthe event could be fairly soon after trip to Portal Station */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* have Kali and Merris fall in love rather quickly - it doesn't have to be a long event... */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* character that attacks first and assumes heavy threat environment - could have her attack Kali first, then think she is the Dark Lady */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">descriptions of place where the rescued items get cycled back into</p>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>


</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">Insertable Segments</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Insertable concepts and segments - min relative sequence */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* somewhere in death is only the beginning, when she is talking to the Lady about recruiting the suicide */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">no one ever really looks at the root cause of suicide. they want to blame a book or a type of music, anything they can pass a law against. they don't want to see that there are some that are too sensitive. maybe the music or book or whatever triggers the event, but i maintain that if one of these is outlawed, there will always be a trigger. the root causes are situations and patterns that remove all hope. the situation may not be true, it just needs to be seen that way. all my life suicide was in the top 5 options, often in spot 2. the only two things that held me back were rage against the situations around me and the desire not to burden those around me with the after-effects. were it not for those, i probably would have as well. too many people paint the world as bleak and hopeless, often without even knowing it. in my case i got so tired of "you have to fit, not make waves, learn to get along". sure it's true, but without any light or hope to balance it, it is crushing, particularly if you already feel alienated, disconnected, and uncertain of how to fit in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* sometime after talking with Lizbet - complaining about religion, people, her life in the realms - or some other point where she is tryng to understand why she couldn't stand her species */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">start with dislike of human systems and expand into her experiences with religion - god as abusive father figure</p>

<p class="regtxt5">she is told to talk to Alice, that she has a different perspective and understanding of things beyond the realms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* teasing Petrov - she slips up behind him and whispers in his ear */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I like feeling your cock rubbing against my ass when you massage me. I like feeling it grow, until you are so turned on you grab my hips and yank them up. You want to slam into me, deep, hard and rough, but you know how much I love you to enter slowly, so I can feel every delicious inch of you slide inside me and spread me open. Once you are all the way in the first time, then you start pounding into me. Hard, fast, showing no mercy, you slam into me so hard it drives me into the pillow and bed. Every once in a while you slip a hand around and flick my clit, pushing my farther into frezy. I feel it when you cum, the hard pull against you, the twitching of your cock, and the change in friction. It drives me over the edge and I arch up, screaming in mind shattering orgasm. I love that you don't go soft immediately, so you can keep up a slow rythm afterwards, sending aftershocks through me until I collapse limp to the bed. You follow me down, and roll us so you remain in me as we snuggle together." Kali smiled as she whispered the last, "Think of how wet I'll be, waiting until we can be together  tonight, lover."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* talking with Ennui, after a Love's Bitch show */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">ENNUI: how do you do it? you wear so little on stage and yet the droolers aren't pawing after you. If i wore that i'd have to fight them off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">i don't know. i guess i'm thinking at some level. for the first time ever i've got it and i'm fucking proud of it. at the same time i've never thought of myself as attractive. and, probably more important, i don't want to be attractive. my guess is i'm not sending out one of the unconcious signals that says available. and, when i think about it, i'm actively thinking, looking is fine, but touch and you die.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">isn't that a bit harsh?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">maybe, but we are taught to flaunt it if we've got it. but then the fuckwit males think that means come and get it and in some ways it really does. who's teaching us this? is it the men because they want to see us in next to nothing? or is it those of us that really want to show off? or is it some weird mix of both and more? why aren't we taught it's good to be smart and strong and able to kick ass? then we could flaunt it and the sub-humans would have to think twice about attacking us. so i'm showing it off because i'm damn proud of it, nothing more, nothing less. it probably helps as well that the stories have gotten around about how i fight. it lends an air of danger that most men are too insecure to want to deal with. and, on top of that, i have so much baggage with sex and sexuallity that i can barely consider pleasuring myself, let alone adding another person to the event.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Kali loves the storms, wind, and leaves of fall - it is her favorite season in Eternia */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* on surviving childhood, the z race, and the rest */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* adapt in kali_full to show how this allowed her to survive the feelings of difference, of not belonging and not being in the right body */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">i knew from when i was little that i didn't belong there, on that Realm. then when i was twelve i read a book about a desert world, an empire, spice. i prayed for visions like those of the main character. i begged for them and the mission that would take me away from that wretched reality. that would let me feel the void around me, get me to new worlds. i remember the crushing disappointment when it didn't happen. when i knew i was trapped and would die there. it killed something inside me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">being different was painful. in an attempt to minimize the pain i tried to chameleon, become what was wanted and expected. i don't think i did very well at it though. and it left me bitter and angry, because, really i didn't want to be what i often tried to become. i tried it for so long that i lost track of what i wanted. now when someone asks, i don't even know where to look. the pattern was set by the time i started dating. i would try to scope out what my partner at the time would want and become it. i wouldn't admit what i wanted because it didn't seem important and i wouldn't have known anyway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">there were others that appreciated books on fellowship and friendship more. the empires and plots resonated more with me. it fit my understanding but non-comprehension of the games of people in the world around me. i didn't belong, i wasn't supposed to be there, other than to gather my people and leave. the games were all a crock of shit. the mad dance of frantic monkeys in the zoo made as much sense.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">i had a whole comsmology. there were a bunch of us, survivors of a galactic race crashed on the realm and searching for a way home. if only i could See enough to get us there. it spread through my friends in a viral wave until many of us belived, and still nothing. i still feel the loss...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">being different was painful. in an attempt to minimize the pain i tried to chameleon, become what was wanted and expected. i don't think i did very well at it though. and it left me bitter and angry, because, really, i didn't want to be what i often tried to become. i tried it for so long that i lost track of what i wanted. now when someone asks, i don't even know where to look. the pattern was set by the time i started dating. i would try to scope out what my partner at the time would want and become it. i wouldn't admit what i wanted because it didn't seem important and i wouldn't have known anyway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">when puberty hit and i felt even more wrong, it didn't matter. i wasn't from there. i was from somewhere else, somewhere where the rules were different. i didn't have to learn the stereotypes, didn't have to fit, i was an alien amongst a strange race, an anthrpologist of sorts. and in the end i would be leaving, returning to a home of my choosing, where things would be "right". it kept me from having to deal with some of the other issues underneath. i survived where my sister didn't because i wasn't really a part of it anyway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Kali's take on Tabitha's contact with Eternia */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the song wound down to an end. Kali slowed and drifted back to awareness. For a moment the image wavered and shifted. The faces around her melted into grey fog leaving only the face of a single dancer, dressed in torn faded blue jeans and a black tank top. For moments they locked gazes. Startled green eyes stared back into Kali's grey ones. In the distance a shrill voice split the silence. The girl disappeared as Kali snapped back to the club. Virtigo threatened to dump her to the floor until the music swept her up again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Kali and steam */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">remember - she has increased boiler pressure to 300 for the K-666 series</p>

<p class="regtxt5">train is over 4100 ft in car length plus another 400 ft for locos - this is a parking issue...:)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">could consider spliting into 4 trains and travel in convoy - from the list in crew this would break out as:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">? - why are you using steam engines? Deisels are so much better.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">k - true, but they lack something. sure the steam engines are less efficient, but then so am i. they fit in a time where elligance was as important as function. they no longer fit in the world, just like i don't. we are similar misfits.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on the wilds */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I grew up with this myth in my head that I was an outdoors person. that i liked living in the wilds, away from other people. it wasn't true. What i wanted was to be left alone, not to live in the wilds. i like being able to go to the market for food, the pub for a beer, food and friends. I like standing on my balcony in the howling wind and rain and then going and taking a hot shower. life is better when i'm warm, dry, and comfortable. i can see enough of the wilds on a day hike from Portal Station. so, i'm just another city girl who's been rather slow in realizing it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I don't like being cold, wet, uncomfortable. i'll do it as part of a mission or for friends of mine, but for "recreation"? i don't see the draw in it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* recovery shed */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">this is the place where the rescued material gets sorted, graded, and marked for return to the Realms. It is a huge expanse of linked warehouses and offices. up in the rafters of the shed on the main recieving platform is a tiny office, reachable by ladder only. inside is a u shaped wooden counter burried under computer monitors. a battered black leather executive chair enfolds the mystery woman when she is here. the monitors display databases, network routing data, and various forms of status on arriving and departing trains. the mystery woman doesn't run the place, she maintains the software and network for the sorting groups and has inspired the linking of the additional facility in Goth City. her monitors display data available at various stations throughout the recieving and sorting sites.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* perils of bedrooms */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At first they sleep downstairs in the room with all the pillows until Kali suggests moving the pillows upstairs. "Look, it won't really be a bedroom then. We'll just be sleeping in another room. I'll be there to keep you safe."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They woke in a tangle of pillows, bedding and limbs. "Did that help?"
"Yes - the pillows made it seem like I was still safely in the room downstairs. The closed curtains helped too. So did you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Good!" Kali replied as she kissed her thoroughly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* when she is learning to drive - one of the instructors is friendly */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Merris, can I ask you something?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* for once she has targeted a firestorm away from herself instead of focusing it inward */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She could feel it building, burning along her nerves, clawing to get out. As it reached white hot crescendo she turned and pointed. Energy snapped out in a furious wave and crashed over the target. Flame blossomed as the shock wave crashed over her. All that remained when the fire died was shattered wreckage. Shaking from the flow of energies Kali slowly sank to her knees. Shock and elation coursed through her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* welcome to Death City Railroad */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Leopardess thundered around the corner and onto a straight stretch leading to the destination up ahead. Scanning the track for debris Kali just glimpsed a figure standing near the track. Instantly she locked the brakes. Metal screamed as leopardess clawed her way to a stop.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Stabbing the cancel button killed the throbbing industrial soundtrack that had been keeping her company. She leapt from the engine and prowled up to the girl. "What are you doing out here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A frightened tear stained face looked up at her. "Waiting for a train."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This is a dead stretch. Nothing comes along here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You did," the girl countered with a bit of fire in her voice. Her next words stopped Kali mid thought. "The Dark Mother told me to wait here for a train to Eternia. Are you that train?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This...this train is from Eternia, yes. We are returning there." Kali stammered. ‘Mother, what is this?’ she wondered.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I would like a ride."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know the words then?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I enter freely and of my own will. The Dark Mother made me remember them," the girl replied with the ghost of a smile.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Then enter freely and welcome to the Death City Railroad..." Kali paused expectantly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"need name"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome Tabitha and Blessed Be. I am Kali." Kali smiled at the startled look that flashed across the girl’s face. "No, the Dark Mother and I share a name, but I am not her." Kali helped the girl to mount to the engine and settled her in the jump seat. "Once we are in the Void I'll take you back and introduce you to the others." Kali grinned and said, "Hope you like industrial cuz that’s what I listen to while driving," as she punched go on the player. The raucous pounding beat thundered in the cab once more as Leopardess clawed herself back into motion.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The girl instinctively slapped her hands over her ears as the noise started. Slowly she pulled them back away as the beat wove itself into her blood. She was grinning as fiercely as Kali as Leopardess reached speed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">woman - youngish, say early twenties - name: Eliza - rough and tumble girl, a fighter. find her on a world during a rescue mission. Kali was sent in when one of the Recovery Teams was suddenly over-run by the local war they were trying to rescue things from. She is under a bit of rubble and comes up fighting. At first she doesn't see who is moving the rubble and just swings. Kali manages to block the first attack and then the girl sees her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali arrived as the waves of combatants broke over the Recovery Team. Quickly her team waded in attempting to reach the others before too many were hurt. Fought their way through trying to kill as many of the demonic forces as possible and not hurt as many defenders as possible. The demonic forces were blasting things apart attempting to kill the retreating defenders. Kali turned at one point to see a young girl staring at her just before a flying chunk of debris hit her. Something in the wild eyed stare called to her. The fight gets more furious for several minutes before the defenders retreat and the demonic forces are driven back. "Tam, get the Recovery Team to their train. Alicia, look for stragglers, we don't have much time." Kali strode to the pile of rubble and began pulling it off the prone figure. Suddenly it erupted upward with a wild knife swing. Leaping back Kali barely evaded the strong thrust. "Easy girl..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The girl's eyes went wide as she looked and saw Kali. "Kali, Mother Goddess, I...it was you..." she fell to her knees offering her knife.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Get up girl. I'm not who you think." Kali snarled, embarrassed. Startled the girl looked up to see Kali kneeling in front of her. "I am just a woman like you. Do not bow to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* on sexuality */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - gods, I've changed some since the realms. Here I feel good about the way I look. Every once in a while I get the urge to vamp out and stalk some of the shy guys. There're a couple of dudes at the yards for example that make me want to slip into tight leather pants and a skimpy top and just stalk them. Prowl up and just ooze it at them. Not cuz I want sex particularly, just cuz I want to see what it feels like to watch them react.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris - I can let you go...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - soberly - No, it’s not that I really want them, it’s just I want to shake them up, mess with their world view. I can't even say why, just that I feel this overwhelming need to yank their chains...I don't understand, it’s something I used to do as often as possible, but I gave it up long ago and thought it had gone away.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris - I think I understand. Maybe you should start again.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - But wouldn't it be wrong? It’s not like they deserve it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Merris - Are you trying to hurt them or just shake them up? If it’s just a shake up then maybe it is a good thing to do once in a while. We all get stagnant, set in our patterns, and sometimes it takes something really outside our experience to break us loose again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* another sexuality thread */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is torn - she wants sex, but she doesn't want the complications of other people, and she wants sex with boys and girls, but her past with boys really makes this a struggle, Ennui and Dementia have to put up with her trying to work it through and give what support they can</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I've read various fan-fics sometimes and the one thing I'm not sure of is the mystic connections ones. Would you really want a connection with someone so deep that every little part of you could flow to the other? I understand the desire to feel the other one, draw strength from them, but more than that is kind of scary don't you think? All of us have those little dark bits that we wish we could get rid of, but since we can't we can at least feel safe knowing no one else needs to see them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on death city */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - This place isn't just about the saving of beauty is it? It’s also a haven for the broken and damaged, a place to heal. Everyone here took some sort of hit in their life that won't let go of them didn't they?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Liz - smiling softly - Yes. All of us here have so much we could give, if only...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - If only we weren't locked behind walls or whimpering in the dark. If we could look beyond what we were taught to believe.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Liz - Yes. Here it can happen. It has happened. You fight for your friends even through the belief that you aren't able. Merris runs dispatch even as she believes she is stupid and inept. Bart was convinced he would never be strong so he repairs heavy equipment. All of us do what we believe we can't here.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - Looking with accusation and a hint of amusement - you aren't from here. You don't belong. There is no taint of damage on you.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Liz - looking up startled, then smiles cocky, her voice no longer broken and thick with accent, now it is rich with power - Very good, writer. But you do know me.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - in a whisper, eyes wide in horror at her temerity - Kali, mother...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kali - eyes dropping swiftly, followed by head and body - Forgive me goddess, forgive me please. I had no right...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Liz - gently forcing her to look up - Wrong daughter. You have every right to ask. Just as I have the right not to answer. <warm smile then serious again> You have every right to love, and safety as well. That is what this place is first of all. A place where you get another chance to experience that.</p>


<p class="regtxt5">/* this can be anywhere - but should have some really good stuff for the two of them first */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I think nirvana is in the moment, it's just most of us are too busy to notice them. Like now, you, absynthe in a glass, the candle, the river outside, this is a perfect time. I've had so many since coming here. (maybe more instances as well - locomotive rolling into the sun, Merris on the bridge and the first kiss,...)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Then why do you look so troubled?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You were right about the shadow walkers - there is a type of madness that drives us. It’s the same madness that causes us to create and destroy. I have memories of many lives, or so it seems. Memories of a place from so long ago. I cherish them, yet they weigh me down. It’s these that keep me from wanting the Havens. I don't want to loose them. Sometimes I lay awake at night and wonder if they are real, and if they are if anything from those places was rescued. Or are my memories the only thing left. I don't want them to be forgotten. Yet I am so tired sometimes. If I can just write them, their memories, their loves, loses, hopes and despairs, then they won't be forgotten. That’s what I was trying to write when I met a chronicler of this place.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is a down side. You have wondered about shadow walkers? Unfortunately what you've heard is true. I think we do have a death wish in some way. I think it's what allows us to move so easily from the Realms to here and back. I'm not sure what causes it, it's probably different for each of us. You know there is always talk of the dance of life. There’s a dance of death as well, but here's the secret, they are the same dance. That’s what the Dark Mother would have us know. There may have been a time where there could be life without death, but not any more. Now they are twined, balanced. One day, love, I shall slip and end up in the death dance. I fear that day, not for myself but for you. I don't want to leave you. On that day Leopardess becomes yours. You may run her or pass her to someone else, as you will. Please just don't let her get scrapped.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">/* Club = Devil's Cathouse - part: another */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is after Merris visit and again before they go out for absinthe. Kali has convinced some of the people from Temple Heath to meet her at the Cathouse. Maybe from curiosity or because they didn't know it existed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The shower felt wonderful, washing the grime of the yards off her and easing the aches in her muscles. As she dried herself she glanced in the mirror over the sink and dropped her eyes like she always did. She already knew and hated the reality that she would see there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For a few moments longer her hands automatically moved the towel in drying motions as a flash of the mirror image slowly forced its way into her awareness. The towel fell forgotten from suddenly lifeless hands as her head snapped up and stared at her reflection. The face staring back was more her and less. Gone was the pudgy edging of too much weight and the roundness of her mom's face. Instead her features were sharper, harder, closer to the look she had always wanted. Her eyes had gone from bland blue to warm grey and her hair had turned from the limp, lifeless no color brown it had been into a tangled wavy riot of dark red.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Doing something she would never have done before she stepped to the door and swung it shut so she could see herself in the large mirror hanging on it. Narrowish hips, trim waist, wide shoulders and a dancer's body stared back at her.  Quickly she swung the door open to drive the stranger away.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stood clutching the sink and shaking slightly. Once she had calmed down she swung the door again and looked once more. 'Oh gods, now what?' Quickly she opened the door and walked in a daze to her bedroom. Flopping back on the bed she stared sightlessly at the canopy above her. 'Now what?' her mind repeated over and over to itself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly her mind returned with a panicked thought, 'Clubbing, oh gods, I promised I'd be there...oh shit!' She held her head in her hands for long moments as she considered not going, of coming up with a good excuse for the crowd in the morning. Her shoulders slumped when she realized she couldn't do that. Bart and several of the others were going to show up as well. They would never forgive her if she bailed out on them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She shook her head and walked to the wardrobe. Swinging it open she found it suddenly contained a greater variety than before. Her eyes scanned across the unfamiliar clothes and came to rest on her usual drab green flight suit. She slipped it on and paused before pulling open the other wardrobe door to reveal another large mirror. She glanced and then stared at the baggy green thing she wore. Moments later she was flinging things onto the bed. Crop tops in black and green, long skirts in blood red, black, dark purple, and forest green, poet shirts, capes, and even a corset flew across the room into the pile gathering on the bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Laughing almost hysterically she threw off the flight suit and started holding up various things from the bed, finally settling on a look somewhere between waif, gypsy, and middle eastern. Dressed in her new look she stared at the stranger in the mirror once more. Slowly she turned and looked at the image she had created. For a few moments she realized how good she really looked before the terror struck again. Terror of the looks and passes, terror of the unwanted attention.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shaky hands reached to pull off the slitted long skirt only to stop as fire burned along her nerves. Her head snapped back and her hands clutched at her tangled hair as the rage pulled her mouth open in a howl of fury and pain. She landed hard on her knees as she collapsed toward the ground. Her scream echoed around the room until the red agony suddenly dropped away. She fell forward onto her hands and huddled there breathing in ragged gasps until her heart beat slowed back to normal.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She stood slowly and grabbed a long hooded black cape from the bed. Throwing it around her shoulders she walked purposefully out of her flat. Her determination held until she reached the street. It faltered when she heard voices coming from the cathedral. Swiftly she darted into the welcoming shadows of the night. Silently she slipped from shadow to shadow, skulking toward the Devil's Cathouse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once again she hovered in the shadows near the entrance. Bart's words sprang unbidden into her mind again, 'You naturally ooze 'Don't Fuck With Me' more than anyone I know. You're stronger and more dangerous than you think you are.' Using his words as a mantra she drew a deep breath and walked toward the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the door the chords once again wrapped around her and drew her in. Scanning the crowd she soon spotted Bart and several others from Temple Heath. They clustered near the bar, some obviously feeling really out of place. She pasted a fake cocky grin on her face and half danced toward them as the music sucked her in. She barely noticed that it was no longer fake when she arrived. "Heya, What's the what? Been waiting long?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No wonder you don't flinch when the trains go by the yard," Bart shouted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, wicked isn't it?" Kali replied smiling.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do you hear the lyrics?" Bart shouted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You don't. Don't need to, most people can't dance lyrics anyway. What's important is the sound and rhythms."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* author cameo */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali sees her sitting by herself in the Adam and Eve, also doing the same thing at the Cathouse. she could find out from Jo that the woman lives in a loft near the Cathouse, helps with the kitchen at the Adam and Eve, and goes out once in a while on the regular rescue missions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">she is always writing on a battered laptop and doesn't really talk to many people. her tastes in food and beer are very similar to Kali's. wears a long beat up leather duster, is plain looking and keeps to the shadows. she could get sucked in now and again as a tech on missions, she has those skills</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui - I've seen her at the cathouse a few times, she always sits by the dance floor bar in the darkest corner she can find. she often alternates between Assisted Suicides and Asthma Attacks for drinks. i don't think I've ever seen her dance or even talk to anyone for that matter.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Audrey (Nightshade) - she lives near the brewery in one of the old warehouses on the top floor. at least i see her go in and a while later the lights come on in an upper corner.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali looked up at Jo as she spun another stout in front of her. "Jo, who is that over in the corner? I see her here almost every night."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know her name. She never gives it. I think she might be mute or something. I've seen her help mum out in the kitchen a few times, more than that, who can say?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali watched the woman in the shadows throughout the night. She sat quietly in the darkest corner under one of the arches supporting the roof vault. She was typing continuously on a battered laptop. Once in a great while she would look up for a moment and then return to staring at the screen. At last curiosity overcame reluctance and Kali rose. She strode boldly toward the table intent on asking the woman who she was. As she approached something in the scene slowed her down until she was moving slowly and with great deference. When she reached the table she said quietly, "Excuse me..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The figure looked up from the laptop. Kali blinked in surprise at the empty voids where the eyes should have been. When she looked again tired grey eyes regarded her. "Yes?" the word was whispered tonelessly with just the hint of a question at the end.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May I join you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For long moments the eyes regarded her expressionlessly. At last the figure raised a hand from the keyboard and waved assent. Kali spun a chair out from the table, straddled it, and rested her elbows on the chair back. For long moments she regarded the silent figure as well. The woman was neither young, nor old. Her face was nondescript, not beautiful or ugly, or handsome, or plain. It was a face it would be very hard to pick out of a crowd. She wore baggy clothing over an androgynous frame. After a long scrutiny Kali asked, "May I ask what you are writing?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The figure stared at Kali until she grew uncomfortable. Then a hint of a smile appeared on the face. Kali was never sure if it was real or slightly mocking because the expressionless whispered word reverberated in her head like a gong. "You," was the single word reply.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali sat stunned as ice crawled up her back. Finally she pried herself up from the chair and stumbled back to the Temple Heath table on rubbery legs. She sat quietly beside Merris and stared into her stout.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* after a ride home in a storm */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She left wet footprints as she hurried up the stairs to her flat. Once inside the door and up the spiral stairs she began shedding wet clothes as she walked. By the time she was to the passage in front of the bathroom she was naked. Tracy came around the corner and stopped, startled. "I didn't think you were going to make it until after the rain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was such a glorious ride. Wind whipping the rain around, sheets of it falling from the roofs, and rivers in the streets." Kali shivered with delight. "No one around, just the rain, wind, and the grey light filtered through the billowing clouds."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Those the new tattoos? They're beautiful. Although where their tongues are is possitively wicked." The snakes curving high around Kali's hips and diving to her pubic bone shimmered in rich metalic colors. As she moved they shimmered and wavered as if in movement themselves.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know," Kali grinned impishly. "Marianne out did herself this time. The tongues were wicked painful but I do like how they came out." She turned so Tracy could see where the snakes continued around her back with their tails touching at the base of her spine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow, makes me reconsider getting one for myself. Marianne still works out of Death's Head Tattoo in Goth City?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That she does."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* talking with Bart - not long after where i am stalled in Dance... */

<p class="regtxt5">Bart followed her up from the Vault and out of the Adam and Eve. "You're pushing yourself awefully hard. You do realize that, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I guess..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This isn't the Realms. You don't have to work yourself to death to survive. The extraction work you do is enough. Anything else you want to do should be because you want to."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I keep telling you it is because I want to!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But how much can you realistically expect yourself to do? You dance and you work out so you can dance. You work at Temple Heath and go on extractions and train to be a driver.

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure my friends see enough of me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not from what Ennui and Merris say. Look, you are a wonderful asset to my team and I don't want you to burn out and disappear. Just think about some time for yourself in your schedule."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* after the first death under Kali's command */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali stood on the back platform, looking into the void behind the train. A lone tear tracked down her cheek as the last moments of the battle played over in her head.

<p class="regtxt5">/* make sure to use the part from the notes where Kali is wearing leotard with tights and not comfortable that way */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire overhears Kali complaining about not being able to get a sequence that works with one of the new songs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, I know a dance instructor at Freda's Gym. I can introduce you if you'd like. Maybe you could talk it over with her. Explain what you want to do and see what she says."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, I don't know..." Kali answered. A spasm of fear flickered at the thought of a professional evaluating her techniques.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm taking classes with her." Claire blushes, "I won't ever be as good as you, but it makes me feel better when i'm on the floor at the club."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You'll probably be better than me. I haven't had any training."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">later...</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On Claire's recommendation I had on a more modest leotard and tights. The leotard was alright, but I didn't like the way the tights clung to and pulled against my movements. I kept pulling at them under my cargo pants, trying to get them to stop grabbing in sensitive spots.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here we are" Claire stopped and pointed to a non-descript building with a faded sign painted on it. "Come on in." She motioned for Kali to precede her into the building. Kali hung back, forcing Claire to enter first. The smell of stale sweat, towels, and socks assailed Kali as she followed her in. She stopped abruptly as all the horrid memories of gym class flooded her brain.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Inside there was a small counter with an athletic looking blonde woman standing behind it. "Claire, you're here early."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mel, this is Kali. I was going to introduce her to Jessi. Is she around?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She's up in the office, getting ready for class, I think."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks, see you later." Claire walked toward a set of stairs opposite the entry door. Reluctantly Kali followed along. The stairs led up into a brightly lit room with mirrors, barres, aerobic steps, and other less identifiable paraphenalia. A door to the right of the stairs led to a small office and locker room. Behind a desk was a small black haired woman. Her hair was cropped short and she had large wire rim glasses perched on her nose. She looked up and smiled as as Claire walked in. "Jessi, this is my friend Kali, she's interested in dance classes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali leaned against the door frame, trying to keep her pounding heart under control. It was taking more than she had thought to not run from the criticism she expected to follow.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jessi looked Kali up and down for a moment, taking in her stance and posture. "Do I know you from somewhere?" She looked for a few moments longer, long enough for Kali to turn bright red and start to edge toward the door. "I'm sorry Kali, you just seem very familiar for some reason. Were you looking to learn a specific style or do want to try a few to see where you'd like to take it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Still bright red she stammered, "I...I guess the general path. I'm not sure I'd like ballet, it seems a little too formal for me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The beginning, general class meets on thursdays, if you'd like to come."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't start her in the beginning class. It'll bore her to tears. It would bore me and I'm not a dancer." Claire protested.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Claire, no really, I can start in the beginning class. I haven't studied so it would do me some good."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't listen to her. I think you should just audition her. Give her a chance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali froze at the thought. "That's really not necessary..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe Claire is right. I can schedule an audition time for you or I have some time now if you've got your gear with you. Usually there are two ways I do this. The first way I let you pick the music and show me what you can do. The other way I pick the music and see what you can put together for it. Since you haven't done this before, I'd recommend doing something you're comfortable with."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, uh I have my stuff in the bag. I wasn't expecting to do more than exercise today, though." Kali responded slowly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire grinned, "Come on Kali. I've got the Love's Bitch practice CD in my bag. You can pick any of them, although Dead Living might be the best example of your abilities."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute, you're the dancer for Love's Bitch? No wonder you seemed familiar."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali blushed a deep red, "Yes...but..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your work is very good, and you say you haven't studied here or in the Realms?" Jessi waited until Kali managed a strangled "yes" before she continued, "I've come to see every show you've been in. I have an advanced class on wednesdays, although, if that doesn't work I have a block of time after the intermediate class on tuesdays that you could have. What is it you wanted to persue?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Advanced?" Kali choked out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Definitely advanced, although tuesdays might be better. You are already doing most of what I'm teaching the advanced class, although your form could use a little cleanup."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't doubt it," Kali mummbled, still dazed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't worry, you don't need much. There are a couple of positions where your form is a bit sloppy. A little work and those will be fine. What are you hoping to get from instruction?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I feel blocked, I guess. I can't quite get my body to do what I see for some of the routines I want to do. I feel like I don't know enough and that actual training will fill in the gaps. And I'd like to know how to exercise correctly. I'm working at Temple Heath and need strength training but I don't want it to impact my dance."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That should be easy. Why don't you plan on coming to the beginning class a few times? I could use you to demo and you could pick up some of the missing parts of your training. If you want more practice time you can come to any of the other classes as well. Beginners are on thursday, two classes worth, advanced is wednesdays, one class but double the usual time, and intermediate is on tuesdays. And I'd like to plan on seeing you tuesdays as well, maybe starting today, if that works for you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean after the intermediate class?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. However, I don't think you'd have many difficulties coming to the intermediate class starting in fifteen minutes. Claire can show you where to change and help you with the things you don't know. She's in this class as well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Claire led the way to the locker rooms and pointed out the usual features. "Nice thing about here is we don't need locks." While they were changing other students arrived and called out greetings to Claire. She in turn introduced Kali.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They returned to the classroom where Kali took a place at the back of the class. Claire helped her through the warmup exercises, explaining the terms and names as Jessi called them out. Once the warmups were done Jessi moved on to working on the routines for the evening. She demonstrated the first one then asked the class to repeat it. Once everyone had tried it she called Kali forward. "I'd like to introduce you all to Kali. She comes to us from an experimental dance school. They taught her many of the positions and movements I've been teaching you but they didn't believe the names or history was important. I would like each of you to help her with the things she doesn't know yet. Now, Kali, could you run through that for us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Face flaming Kali flawlessly executed the complicated series of moves while Jessi explained each one. Once Kali finished she started to walk back to the back. "Not yet, could you run through that again, please? Take it at half speed if you could." Kali thought for a few moments and launched into a slow motion version of the sequence. This time Jessi pointed out each bit of the form, stopping only long enough to say, "Again," when Kali reached the end. "Better yet, just keep repeating the routine until I say stop." Obediently Kali started up again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Thirty minutes later Jess called a break. "Kali, could you wait a moment?" Kali stopped and turned. "I'd like you to demonstrate one of your routines, the one from Dead Living. Claire's right, it is one of your best. It also makes a point that I'd like to make for the class."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can try, although I'll need the music to remind me how it goes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That will be fine. Claire," Jessi called. When Claire darted over she asked, "Could you get the player from my office and cue up Dead Living for Kali? I'd like her to show us her routine. Claire headed for the office, looking very pleased with herself.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once the class reassembled Jessi started, "I have asked Kali to run through a routine for us. There is another part to her bio that I didn't mention earlier. She is the dancer for Love's Bitch, the house band at the Devil's Cathouse. Kali, if you would?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali launched into the routine. To her it felt lifeless and strained being performed to a pale immitation of the live event. When she finished the class spontaneously applauded. "Could you run through it at half speed this time?" Jessi asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I..I don't know. I'll have to go through it full speed again and then maybe... Claire?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait just a moemnt please. Here is a point to consider. The longer you dance the more your body knows what to do. That's not to say you can stop listening and paying attention, just that you will know what to do at a less concious level. Ok, you may proceed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali ran through the routine to the music again and then slowed it down for a third repeat. "Here is the second point. Notice there were several places where she broke some of the rules I've been teaching. The point is it is ok to break the rules under two conditions. One, that you do not endanger yourself in doing so, and two, you make a concious decision for a deliberate effect. I'm going to ask Kali to go through the routine once more at half speed and I want you to pay attention to how it is put together."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The class proceeded this way for the rest of the time period. Jessi would demonstrate a routine, Kali would mimic it while she pointed out the intricacies, and then the class would work on it. The hour and a half class passed in a quick blur.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* discussing sex/sexuality */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, have you done it yet, slept with anyone, since your change? That medic of yours is a hot boy, and Merris is a fine lady..." Ennui asked, half serious, half teasing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No!" Kali looked scandalized.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why not? Aren't you the least bit curious?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh yes, but.." Kali trailed off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're safe here from disease and pregnancy. Go ahead!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sex doesn't have to be about relationships, just as relationships don't have to be about sex. You've been telling us how you don't want to immediately get into a romantic relationship here. Go out and have a little fun before you settle down. Play the field, this is the best place for it," Dementia added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali shrunk further into herself as she whispered, "It's not that easy. I've never been able to do casual sex without it turning serious way too fast. Fuck, I have enough issues with it in a steady relationship."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But don't you want it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, it just makes me feel dirty and creepy when I do. Like I don't respect the other person and it's worse when I know them. It's lots of things, bad religion growing up, then a partner that had their own issues with it, then...ah fuck, it always seems too complicated whatever way I try... It even feels creepy when it's just with myself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* on men */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kali: Gods help me, I find the strong, rugged types most desirable. Must be a girl thing, I never understood it before, but it feels weird to me. It's something unexpected and I'm not sure what I think about it. Take Petrov for instance. Before, men like him would scare the crap out of me. I couldn't understand how some of my friends could find men like that anything but scary and creepy, now, I want him in the worst way. It doesn't seem fair. For instance, Danny is a wonderful man, sweet, kind, considerate, what should be a perfect catch, yet he doesn't get the libido going like Petrov.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ennui: Don't worry about it. There's plenty of people for Danny. As for you, well, it's just what you like. It's not a case of right or wrong, it's just a combination of many factors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Kali may know how to dance, however she still needs to learn how to keep herself in shape to dance - instead of waiting for Tracy she can ask Claire about it */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It would be so easy, to step onto a Sacred Unit, to walk off into the wreckage on a rescue world, to just sit down and let go. It's all just too much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Lady wouldn't stop you," Merris came up from behind her and wrapped her arms around her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know. I wanted an end of the fear I've felt all my life, but it didn't end the way I expected. Now I fear for my friends, and it's worse, gods, it's so much worse! Some of them will die and I cannot prevent it." Kali continued to stare blankly into the distance as tears streaked her face. "Why am I this, this death dealer, this revered leader? It's worse than being the nobody, the nothing I was. As I nobody I only hurt myself when I fucked up." Kali turned to face her lover as she spoke again, "Gods, Merris, I want to run, I want to run so very far away and end it before more of them die." Her head dropped, "But I won't. More would die without me than will with me. I know this, but it still hurts so very badly!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jasmine carefully examined the site. Moving and pulling the flesh a little in each direction until she had the perfect lineup. She placed two felt tip marker dots at the target entry and exit points then swabbed the area with disinfectant. "Remember, take a deep breath and breath out as I go through. It dissipates the pain and speeds the endorphins."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Jasmine picked up a pair of forceps and carefully clamped onto the skin. With a gentle tug she pulled the skin into position and held it steady. "Breathe," she said softly as she plunged the needle through the target marks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The pain was a sharp flash of brilliance as the needle dove through her flesh. All her thoughts paused for that moment, halted by the insitance of it. The ring was a delcious coolness following close on its heels. Endorphines surged, wrapping her in a warm blanket, keeping the aches at bay for a few moments of bliss. Slowly they faded and the throbbing ache of a fresh wound intruded. for a moment she felt regret until she saw the purple stone flashing from the ring in her belly. She smiled up at Jasmine, "Wicked awesome, thanks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now I'd tell you about care and healing, but since this is Eternia, healing is wildly different from person to person. Keep it clean and when you can easily move the jewelry in the piercing it is probably healed enough. You can change it or remove it for periods of time after that. I have seen piercings close up here, so if you want to keep it you will want to keep something in most of the time."</p>
