<p class="pagecaption">The "God Particle"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Maria Asanova had been a grad student when the giant collider was started. She dreamed of the day it would be finished and operational. Everything she did in her studies was pointed at being assigned to an investigative team at the facility.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was one of the first experimental physicists to be brought in when experiments were being designed and she was there the day they fired the beam for the first time. She had been promoted to researcher on the day the first god particle test was run. Excitement was in the air, journalists packed the small observation area of the control center, and everyone was running through their checklists with highly focused attention as the countdown clock crawled toward the 0900 trigger time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The facility controller's voice shook only a little as he said, "Go," precisely at 0900. The beams accelerated exactly as planned and the collision occurred at the precise target points. Data flooded the monitors and as Maria leaned forward to look at the raw data she thought she heard a word, dimly, as if from a great distance, "Itathahzk". Startled, she looked up and scanned the room, but everyone else was head down watching the data. She shook her head and went back to her work.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Data analysis proved they had succeeded beyond all hope. The mysterious final particle, the so called "god particle" had been proven to exist. International fame came to the teams and money poured in. The labs expanded and research flourished for several years, until new fields of exploration in the more practical side of physicals started to draw it away. Space exploration caught the world's attention and physicists were called in to solve the enormous travel times conventional propulsion provided.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The half remembered word stuck with her over the years, as she rose to lead researcher and finally to principle investigator. At each new experiment she waited to hear something again, but there was nothing.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Twenty-five years after the first god particle experiments, she was sitting in the now crumbling control center for the accelerator. Only a quarter of the work stations were manned. Many of the others had been cannibalized for parts. The remaining team had struggled to do one last experiment with the accelerator enhanced to the maximum energy possible. Additional magnetic systems had been cobbled together. Miles of wire snaked down corridors to feed the additional electrical needs. The local utility had been bribed, for lack of a better term, to provide a huge energy pulse to the facility for the experiment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">For long months preparations had gone into this last test. Many of them spent in desperate attempts to secure funding. At the very last minute a strange message had arrived in Maria's private mail. It was from Iriadni Ashakara, an insanely wealthy philanthropist. No one knew exactly how Ms. Ashakara had acquired the trillions in her accounts, but she spent it mostly through humanitarian ventures. This was the first time it had gone to a science project.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ms. Ashakara had provided a blank check, with only one requirement, that she be allowed to observe the experiment first hand. Now she sat beside Maria, in the darkened room, and stared at the empty spaces. "It is strange how knowledge is not seen as valuable. Everything has to be for profit. This new interest in space would have gone nowhere, had there not been money to be made in the exploitation."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Maria looked at the countdown clock, showing twenty more minutes, and wished she could hurry things along. It was not possible. The power company could only provide one burst of extra energy, and that only at the designated time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May I ask you something, Ms. Asanova?" Ms. Ashakara asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Certainly, but, please, call me Maria. I am not my mom."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course, Ms., Maria. Please call me Iriadni. In all the experiments you have witnessed, have you ever had anything strange happen?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ever hear anything?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of, of course not," Maria replied, not willing to admit to the word from so long ago.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought so. I heard it too, the first time the experiment ran. Until then, I hadn't paid any attention to science, outside what I had to when finishing school. That day, at precisely the time you ran the first collision I heard 'Itathahzk'. It has taken me until recently to find any clues to what it was. Do you know what it means?" Maria shook her head, no. "It means 'execute'. Rather interesting, considering that is what you say for your experiments. Since I donated directly, I didn't see the grant proposal. What is this experiment trying to accomplish?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are trying to push just a little farther back and see if we can get into the first microseconds of time. And, speaking of, we are just about at our mark."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They sat quietly as Maria watched the clock move to the target time. When it hit, she spoke firmly into the room, "Execute."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the instant data began to stream into the recorders, she heard the voice again, this time she heard a bit more. Frantically she tried to scribble it down, before it faded from her memory. There were at least two voices, both female and of slightly different pitch. She saw Iriadni scribbling as well. Once they had finished, they compared what they had written and discussed it until they agreed. Iriadni pulled a battered notebook from her purse and flipped it open. On the pages were strange symbols with notes surrounding them. The notes were scratched through, overwritten, and showed many revisions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please, watch your data, this could take quite some time and I know there is much you want to examine," Iriadni said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hours passed while Maria sorted through the raw data and tried to get a gestalt on it while Iriadni scribbled and scratched on the notes they had made. At last Iriadni looked up and said, "This is what I have. It seems crazy, though."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She slid the page where they could both see it. On it was written:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Voice 1: Now we see if this will really work</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Voice 2: Execute</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Voice 2: Let there be light</p>
