<p class="pagecaption">The Lady</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was the most memorable woman to walk into the market that day. It wasn't her appearance, her clothes were in the goth style of some of the yunger city people. It wasn't her face, she was neither pretty nor ugly. It was the fact she moved with the coiled spring easiness of a predator. Others picked up on it and surrounded her with a two foot diameter clear area. Her poise was such that she didn't even notice it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She came toward our bakery, eyes watching everything around her. "How much for two pretzels?" Her voice was low, with a hint of some type accent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A dollar. They are two for a dollar or a dozen for ten," I answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fuck it, I'll," she stopped when I twitched at the foul language, then started again, "I am very sorry. I hang out with vulgar people and tend to forget how to speak in polite places. I would like a dozen, please."</p>
