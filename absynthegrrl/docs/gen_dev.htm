<p class="regtxt5">/* ghost ship - rat infested */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Could be interesting terror tale. <a href="http://gawker.com/abandoned-cruise-ship-full-of-starving-rats-headed-for-1507439976">Original Article</a>. Ellie recommends adding zombie remains of the last party of russian aparatchik cruise frozen somewhere in the ship, to thaw at landing time</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Things to remember throughout</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Want to aspire to a more BSG kind of intensity - meaning - need to increase and add tensions between various characters. Even the ones the generally agree on needed actions will disagree on particulars, or purposes. Those that disagree will have even more intense disagreements</p>

<p class="regtxt5">figure out how the 3 sisters get along and how their roles really work in the mulrti-verse - they are the gods, but what can they do, how much do they know, and how hard can they twist on things without action/reaction/effects spinning farther out of control than the desired results</p>

<p class="regtxt5">remember the Razaks and Zeltropians both attempted genocide - neither was successful, however, both significantly reduced each other's populations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Breaks in the truce coincide with increased threats of release of the Creator and Destructor. As the multi-verse destabilizes, everything goes into flux. Aztol's capture of Ishra brought focus to the instability by shifting the balance of power in the Abyss. His goals are personal power, not the release of the Old Ones, but his actions have galvanized many factions into increased action.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Remeber that every faction has its own agenda and these will collide in unexpected ways. Take a page from Stross Merchant Prince eries in everyone has their own trajectory and this will spin their reactions to others. Things should build to a pretty messed up state before the truce is re-estabilshed, Ishra freed, and Aztol defeated.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Remember disease and sanitation dynamics in the various large cities. Some would be prone to outbreaks, smells, and other useful annoyances.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">REMEMBER - the darker side of the multi-verse. This is not a multi-verse of only fluffy bunnies and kittens, there are dark forces at work as well. Think in a Lovecraftian way about some of this, besides the socio/psychopathic nature of people like Aztol.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">REMEMBER - some character sketches have story notes in the as well. This is because they don't have story segments of themselves in the writings area</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* timeline calculations data */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">/* could adjust multi-verse accordingly, although full multi-verse could be even older than this universe, given all that has happened in it */</p>

<p class="regtxt12">age of universe 13.798±0.037 billion years<br/>
age of earth 4.54 ± 0.05 billion years<br/>
life on earth 3.8 billion years for first cellular activity</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Things to consider revising</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>


</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Surplus shop that buys less than idea majikal and alchemical devices, then sells the to the unsuspecting populace. These items are sub-standard or flawed in one or more ways, sometimes dangerous, sometimes humorous, but never quite working as advertised. This is based off this fragment from RPGNow.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The world's ultimate goblin entrepreneur is back! His previous business (detailed in Loot 4 Less, vol. 7: Krazy Kragnar's Used Chariots) was closed after a dwarven nobleman perished in a freak houda accident. Now Krazy Kragnar returns with a whole new business plan-he is the owner and chief salesman of the Alchemical Surplus Shop, a place that buys alchemist fire that's past its use-by date, thunderstones that don't meet military specifications, and refurbished tanglefoot bags in bulk and passes the savings on to the customer.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Of course, when dealing with alchemical materials that are left over from, rejected by, or bought at the estate sale of the previous owner, you often end up with some nonstandard merchandise. The Alchemical Surplus Shop would be happy to sell discounted acid flasks and sunrods if they were available, but such items are bought up long before Kragnar gets on the scene. Not to worry, though! Less popular items are usually passed over by merchants salvaging the smoking crater of a failed alchemical bazaar, and their loss is your gain! Kragnar has pulled together new items-from the cacophonous boompot to the subtle clocktinder-all available only here!</p>

<p class="regtxt9">So come browse the shelves, flip through the seasonal catalog, and check out the daily specials. Krazy Kragnar has dozens of alchemical items you've never even heard of, ready to arm adventurers with the power of almost-magic and challenge alchemists by offering new items for them to craft.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">porn star in RotH - she liked being a porn star and enjoyed all the sex, even if it was for "work" - need to figure out where she comes from and how she becomes involved</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Psychic Wars - somewhere/when there is a psychic war being fought - think <a href="../gm_resources/info/lyrics/psychic_wars.htm">Veteran of the Psychic Wars</a> as a concept - the psychic wars will impact visions and seers mot - similar to the distortions in Dune when too many prescients are staring into the same events. Seers such as Ang, Dementia, Shan, Yara, and Irena will notice the ripples of it more than non-seers. The wars are being fought by several groups over territory and power. They aren't directly tied to the Creator/Destructor struggle, but the distortions to seeing will have an impact</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* concepts to use somewhere */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">the space shuttle ends where the subway begins - good line, where can it be used in the game?
(is copyrighted - no can use in published works)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I feel like I'm bleeding from an emotional wound that I can't get closed. It's leaving me empty and grey."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* thought: would be interesting to have some character somewhere comment on stories about any sort of merc/continual danger job. something along lines of: most of this is written by people who have a roof, a steady job, and minimal danger in their day to day lives. most of them would freak if they had to live under conditions they write... */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">glass roman gaming die found in egypt - see pict in this data file - based on a high impact plastic one brought back by time travelling - use as part of the revised time travel to ancient egypt thing started long ago - maybe thread in a Death City link - time traveller dies and ends up there?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">revisit the faberge style egg with gate controller inside - left behind as part of the Aztol missions? - same world as Angelique - emergence would be in the late 20's/early 30s - eggs would be there, someone could find it and conceal it in one</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Use Somewhere - for a shifter - Mere or someone else */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">BOSS: You came across that item through flouting my rules. We can solve this by you returning it to me</p>

<p class="regtxt5">SHIFTER: So this is how you think it will play out. I give you your thing back and walk away, right?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">BOSS: (nods)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">SHIFTER: I see it a different way. I kill you and your thugs and keep the item. It's a win for this place and a win for me. Or, you could walk away now and no one gets hurt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">BOSS: The law will take you. I am a pillar in this community. I have more thugs, as you call them, than you can possibly kill.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">SHIFTER: I doubt that. (kills boss first, then thugs - assimilates boss appearance - walks back into establishment)</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* bio-ship ideas */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider some spelljammer cross-over into the multi-planar aspects of planescape.
also consider using the LegendOfSpelljammer to instead describe a bio-ship developed by either the Seed Team, or somethinglike them.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* band and misc names */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fugitive Dust</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Insertable Segments</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cave from dream - grantire sloping two entry points, one above the other, main section starts at the lower entry and curves down to the left. At the center of the curve water falls in a steady dtream down the face of rock. A smaller side passage curves up to a ledge in the left wall and then up to a smaller entry about twenty feet vertically and 50 feet to the left of the main entry. What lies down around the curve in the main path can be decided. Should atleast be a pool or small underground river to take the water away, maybe more caves if desired. Can use this anywhere...consider shrine/place for Iskandera stories</p>


<p class="regtxt5">Scene of last stages of an evac. Coordinated by people that wouldn't be expected to do something like this. In the dream sequences old equipment was re-purposed for coordination and the op was run from either a shop or a home in a run down section of town. Could work as part of the Mega-Corp Ascendency timeline or elsewhere. Could also work n the Irendi timeline - which is the precursor to the Empire of Valen's time. Something takes the last of the humans off the old world of Karanal and forces them into the rest of the galaxy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Time-looping dream - a person, trying to save his friends and their children. In each itteration he manages to have all-but-one of them survive at the end of the loop. In the last itteration, the man was missing, leaving the wife and the children. In the time-bounce the man saw the shifter just before the bounce, which left the shifter crying, now its all wrong...after having been crying from the husband being missing</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Aztol - realizing he can take the data gathering demons Ishra has made a vailable to the Balance Keeper and twist them into the Riders and Controllers he favors.</p>
