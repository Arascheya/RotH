<p class="regtxt5">"We aren't going to get all of them out, you know." Kayara said as she stared out into the deepening night.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know," Elentaryn answered in a tired voice. "What are your estimates?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thirty million most likely. We don't have enough space on the ships, in suspension, or transportation to get them here. Then there are the ones that won't leave."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Still? Even after the explanations?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Even after. In some it's a death wish. The ones that amaze me are those that think they will survive it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We could force them..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"To what end? They'd end up taking spaces that could be used for those that want to leave. Besides it's not our way."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Has it started yet?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The looting and the disorder? Not yet. So far most people are well enough informaed and things are still moving along. I expect it to fall apart as soon as they realize they all won't make it."</p>
