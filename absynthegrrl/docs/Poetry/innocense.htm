<p class="sectioncaption">Auguries of Innocence</p>
<p class="regtxt5">William Blake</p>
<p class="regtxt5">To see a world in a grain of sand,<br/>
And a heaven in a wild flower,<br/>
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,<br/>
And eternity in an hour.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A robin redbreast in a cage<br/>
Puts all heaven in a rage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A dove-house fill'd with doves and pigeons<br/>
Shudders hell thro' all its regions.<br/>
A dog starv'd at his master's gate<br/>
Predicts the ruin of the state.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A horse misused upon the road<br/>
Calls to heaven for human blood.<br/>
Each outcry of the hunted hare<br/>
A fibre from the brain does tear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A skylark wounded in the wing,<br/>
A cherubim does cease to sing.<br/>
The game-cock clipt and arm'd for fight<br/>
Does the rising sun affright.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Every wolf's and lion's howl<br/>
Raises from hell a human soul.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The wild deer, wand'ring here and there,<br/>
Keeps the human soul from care.<br/>
The lamb misus'd breeds public strife,<br/>
And yet forgives the butcher's knife.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The bat that flits at close of eve<br/>
Has left the brain that won't believe.<br/>
The owl that calls upon the night<br/>
Speaks the unbeliever's fright.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He who shall hurt the little wren<br/>
Shall never be belov'd by men.<br/>
He who the ox to wrath has mov'd<br/>
Shall never be by woman lov'd.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The wanton boy that kills the fly<br/>
Shall feel the spider's enmity.<br/>
He who torments the chafer's sprite<br/>
Weaves a bower in endless night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The caterpillar on the leaf<br/>
Repeats to thee thy mother's grief.<br/>
Kill not the moth nor butterfly,<br/>
For the last judgement draweth nigh.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He who shall train the horse to war<br/>
Shall never pass the polar bar.<br/>
The beggar's dog and widow's cat,<br/>
Feed them and thou wilt grow fat.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The gnat that sings his summer's song<br/>
Poison gets from slander's tongue.<br/>
The poison of the snake and newt<br/>
Is the sweat of envy's foot.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The poison of the honey bee<br/>
Is the artist's jealousy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The prince's robes and beggar's rags<br/>
Are toadstools on the miser's bags.<br/>
A truth that's told with bad intent<br/>
Beats all the lies you can invent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It is right it should be so;<br/>
Man was made for joy and woe;<br/>
And when this we rightly know,<br/>
Thro' the world we safely go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Joy and woe are woven fine,<br/>
A clothing for the soul divine.<br/>
Under every grief and pine<br/>
Runs a joy with silken twine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The babe is more than swaddling bands;<br/>
Every farmer understands.<br/>
Every tear from every eye<br/>
Becomes a babe in eternity;</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This is caught by females bright,<br/>
And return'd to its own delight.<br/>
The bleat, the bark, bellow, and roar,<br/>
Are waves that beat on heaven's shore.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The babe that weeps the rod beneath<br/>
Writes revenge in realms of death.<br/>
The beggar's rags, fluttering in air,<br/>
Does to rags the heavens tear.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The soldier, arm'd with sword and gun,<br/>
Palsied strikes the summer's sun.<br/>
The poor man's farthing is worth more<br/>
Than all the gold on Afric's shore.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One mite wrung from the lab'rer's hands<br/>
Shall buy and sell the miser's lands;<br/>
Or, if protected from on high,<br/>
Does that whole nation sell and buy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He who mocks the infant's faith<br/>
Shall be mock'd in age and death.<br/>
He who shall teach the child to doubt<br/>
The rotting grave shall ne'er get out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He who respects the infant's faith<br/>
Triumphs over hell and death.<br/>
The child's toys and the old man's reasons<br/>
Are the fruits of the two seasons.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The questioner, who sits so sly,<br/>
Shall never know how to reply.<br/>
He who replies to words of doubt<br/>
Doth put the light of knowledge out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The strongest poison ever known<br/>
Came from Caesar's laurel crown.<br/>
Nought can deform the human race<br/>
Like to the armour's iron brace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When gold and gems adorn the plow,<br/>
To peaceful arts shall envy bow.<br/>
A riddle, or the cricket's cry,<br/>
Is to doubt a fit reply.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The emmet's inch and eagle's mile<br/>
Make lame philosophy to smile.<br/>
He who doubts from what he sees<br/>
Will ne'er believe, do what you please.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">If the sun and moon should doubt,<br/>
They'd immediately go out.<br/>
To be in a passion you good may do,<br/>
But no good if a passion is in you.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The whore and gambler, by the state<br/>
Licensed, build that nation's fate.<br/>
The harlot's cry from street to street<br/>
Shall weave old England's winding-sheet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The winner's shout, the loser's curse,<br/>
Dance before dead England's hearse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Every night and every morn<br/>
Some to misery are born,<br/>
Every morn and every night<br/>
Some are born to sweet delight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some are born to sweet delight,<br/>
Some are born to endless night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We are led to believe a lie<br/>
When we see not thro' the eye,<br/>
Which was born in a night to perish in a night,<br/>
When the soul slept in beams of light.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">God appears, and God is light,<br/>
To those poor souls who dwell in night;<br/>
But does a human form display<br/>
To those who dwell in realms of day.</p>
