<p class="regtxt5">John William Burgon</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It seems no work of Man's creative hand,<br/>
by labour wrought as wavering fancy planned;<br/>
But from the rock as if by magic grown,<br/>
eternal, silent, beautiful, alone!<br/>
Not virgin-white like that old Doric shrine,<br/>
where erst Athena held her rites divine;<br/>
Not saintly-grey, like many a minster fane,<br/>
that crowns the hill and consecrates the plain;<br/>
But rose-red as if the blush of dawn,<br/>
that first beheld them were not yet withdrawn;<br/>
The hues of youth upon a brow of woe,<br/>
which Man deemed old two thousand years ago,<br/>
Match me such marvel save in Eastern clime,<br/>
a rose-red city half as old as time.</p>
