<p class="pagecapt2">The Second Coming -- W. B. Yeats</p>
<p class="ptxt2">Turning and turning in the widening gyre</p>
<p class="ptxt2">The falcon cannot hear the falconer;</p>
<p class="ptxt2">Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;</p>
<p class="ptxt2">Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,</p>
<p class="ptxt2">The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere</p>
<p class="ptxt2">The ceremony of innocence is drowned;</p>
<p class="ptxt2">The best lack all convictions, while the worst</p>
<p class="ptxt2">Are full of passionate intensity.</p>
</br>
<p class="ptxt2">Surely some revelation is at hand;</p>
<p class="ptxt2">Surely the Second Coming is at hand.</p>
<p class="ptxt2">The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out</p>
<p class="ptxt2">When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi</p>
<p class="ptxt2">Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert</p>
<p class="ptxt2">A shape with lion body and the head of a man,</p>
<p class="ptxt2">A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,</p>
<p class="ptxt2">Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it</p>
<p class="ptxt2">Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.</p>
<p class="ptxt2">The darkness drops again; but now I know</p>
<p class="ptxt2">That twenty centuries of stony sleep</p>
<p class="ptxt2">Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,</p>
<p class="ptxt2">And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,</p>
<p class="ptxt2">Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p>
</br>
