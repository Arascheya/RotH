<p class="pagecapt2">Crash - written in 1978</p>
<p class="ptxt">I stand at the window,</p>
<p class="ptxt">I see the blackness complete;</p>
<p class="ptxt">Enclosing my world as a blanket,</p>
<p class="ptxt">Strangling her life,</p>
<p class="ptxt">Crippling her with death.</p>
</br>
<p class="ptxt">I walk through the shops.</p>
<p class="ptxt">Wares still hang there,</p>
<p class="ptxt">Wares waiting, waiting for hands</p>
<p class="ptxt">That have gone.</p>
<p class="ptxt">Everyone has gone.</p>
<p class="ptxt">When next I see the shops</p>
<p class="ptxt">The wares will be dust.</p>
<p class="ptxt">Memories, rust, thought, and dust.</p>
</br>
<p class="ptxt">I see the houses.</p>
<p class="ptxt">Empty, silent, unlit,</p>
<p class="ptxt">They stare accusingly.</p>
<p class="ptxt">I hear the ghost echoes of  children:</p>
<p class="ptxt">See the people/shadows drifting, driftiing...</p>
<p class="ptxt">The darkness deadens the echoes,</p>
<p class="ptxt">The shadows dissolve,</p>
<p class="ptxt">I see only houses...</p>
</br>
<p class="ptxt">Once again I see the garden,</p>
<p class="ptxt">Shrouded in black</p>
<p class="ptxt">Not even the moons shine.</p>
<p class="ptxt">No shadows, no people, no light,</p>
<p class="ptxt">Emptiness all.</p>
</br>
<p class="ptxt">I see the plain bloodied.</p>
<p class="ptxt">Strewn with bits of flesh and metal.</p>
<p class="ptxt">Bits of individuals entangled in one.</p>
<p class="ptxt">A once free civilization lies running together,</p>
<p class="ptxt">Mingling with the dust.</p>
<p class="ptxt">Wreckage glowing in the night.</p>
<p class="ptxt">The sun begins to rise.</p>
</br>
<p class="ptxt">I look and see her.</p>
<p class="ptxt">She is looking down at me.</p>
<p class="ptxt">There is blood on her robe,</p>
<p class="ptxt">My blood,</p>
<p class="ptxt">And tears, her tears.</p>
<p class="ptxt">This day was to be ours.</p>
<p class="ptxt">This day we were to be free.</p>
<p class="ptxt">We were to start a new life.</p>
</br>
<p class="ptxt">Now there is only the ticking,</p>
<p class="ptxt">Metal cooling.</p>
<p class="ptxt">Blood, too much blood.</p>
<p class="ptxt">The ground and wreckage covered with it.</p>
<p class="ptxt">Our day of newness turned to ash,</p>
<p class="ptxt">Turned to blood.</p>
</br>
<p class="ptxt">Survivors, shocked, cling to loved ones.</p>
<p class="ptxt">She meets my eyes,</p>
<p class="ptxt">"We will survive," she says</p>
<p class="ptxt">"We will remember and return!"</p>
<p class="ptxt">All is not lost.</p>
<p class="ptxt">Some will survive.</p>
