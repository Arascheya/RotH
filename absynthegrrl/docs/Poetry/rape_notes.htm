<p class="regtxt5">to answer the question first - i have not been raped.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">i don't know where these images come from and i'm not sure why i keep returning to this topic. maybe because it is the ultimate in physical and emotional abuse. as a survivor of emotional abuse maybe it is part of my seeking to understand and heal. whatever the reasons i continue to write new segments for this group every so often.</p>
