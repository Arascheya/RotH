    In the previous chapter, we saw how Bohr's model was remarkably
    successful in explaining the origin of line spectra, and how it was
    able to explain the stability of the atom.&nbsp; Yet, over time, it
    came to be laden with the following drawbacks. 

    <ol>
      <li>It worked only for hydrogen and hydrogen-like atoms and
      radiation.&nbsp; Attempts at extending the hydrogen theory to
      more complex atoms exposed new difficulties.

      </li><li>Some of the spectral lines were shown to possess fine
      structures.&nbsp; At first some refinements to the Bohr theory
      seemed to account for such results, but their brightness could
      not be accounted for.
    </li></ol>
    Some people began suspecting that the problems could not be
    resolved by tinkering with the Bohr model with its well-defined
    electronic orbits.&nbsp; A basic change in worldview, a <i>paradigm
    shift</i>, was needed. 

    <h3><a name="fn1_back"></a>The Double-Slit Experiment</h3>
    Meanwhile, another simple experiment baffled physicists, because
    classical physics fails to explain the results.&nbsp; This
    well-known experiment is called the 'double slit experiment'.&nbsp;
    To simplify the discussion a bit we shall talk about holes instead
    of slits.&nbsp; Briefly, the experiment is as follows. 

    <ol>
      <li>The setup comprises a stream of electrons hitting a wall with
      two small holes.&nbsp; A heated filament is a good source of
      electrons.&nbsp; A constant voltage applied between the source
      and the wall with two holes ensures that electrons arrive at the
      holes with the same momentum.&nbsp; An electron detector at the
      screen detects the rate of arrival of electrons.

      </li><li>If we move the detector very slowly up or down, it will be
      found that the <i>rate goes through maxima and minima</i>
      reminiscent of the interference pattern [<a href="#fn1">1</a>]
      associated with waves described above, <i>but the detected
      individual electrons are always point-like</i>, never smeared
      out.&nbsp; If we close one of the holes, the interference pattern
      is lost, and an image of the open hole is seen.

      </li><li>Suppose we drastically reduce the electron emission rate, to
      such a level that the source emits only one electron at a time,
      at random intervals.&nbsp; We expect that each electron passes
      through only one of the two holes.&nbsp; For the electron that
      passes through one hole, whether the <i>other</i> hole is open or
      closed should not matter.&nbsp; Astonishingly, interference
      fringes <i>still</i> build up on the screen if the experiment
      runs long enough.
    </li></ol>
    Thus we see that electrons, considered to be particles, show
    properties of waves like interference.&nbsp; As you may recall,
    light, well-known to be a wave, also acts as particles in some
    cases, notably the photoelectric effect.&nbsp; This suggests
    something, as De Broglie found out. 

    <h3><a name="fn2_back"></a>De Broglie's Explanation</h3>
    In 1924 Louis de Broglie, an imaginative French physicist, asserted
    that <i>material particles would behave as waves under certain
    conditions, and vice versa</i>.&nbsp; He argued that just as light
    waves behave as particles to give rise to photoelectric effect,
    matter also would behave as waves under certain conditions.&nbsp;
    He even gave a simple formula to calculate the wavelength [<a href="#fn2">2</a>] associated with electrons of a given momentum.

    <p>It might surprise you that the de Broglie wavelength associated
    with photons is equal to the usual electromagnetic
    wavelength.&nbsp; Ordinary objects, such as balls and bullets, also
    have de Broglie waves associated with them, but the wavelengths are
    so small that they can be neglected.&nbsp; Only we enter the
    sub-atomic domain do they gain significance.

    </p><p>This idea of matter waves at first seemed very speculative, and
    failed to attract attention.&nbsp; In 1927, however, it was
    experimentally confirmed to be true by Davisson and Germer at the
    Bell Laboratories, after conducting studies on scattering of
    electron beams from crystals.

    </p><p>Decades later, today, the wave nature of matter is taken almost
    for granted.&nbsp; Diffraction studies involving beams of electrons
    or neutrons are used routinely to study the atomic structures of
    solids and liquids.&nbsp; Matter waves are a valuable supplement to
    X-rays in such studies.&nbsp; Electron microscopes, which employ
    electron beams, have revolutionised microbiology and significantly
    improved our understanding of living organisms.&nbsp; High-energy
    particle accelerators probe extremely small space and time
    intervals using the same principle.<br>
    &nbsp;

    </p><p>Returning to our atom, de Broglie waves clarify the <i>ad
    hoc</i> quantum condition of Bohr's atom.&nbsp; Allowed orbits are
    only those for which the orbit length equals an <i>integral
    multiple of electron wavelengths</i>.&nbsp; All other orbits
    disappear due to <i>destructive interference</i>.

    </p><p>Nevertheless, objections to Bohr's theory continued to persist
    due to its drawbacks mentioned above; a large number of
    generalisations and modifications to Bohr's theory were tried, but
    they were all complicated and unsatisfactory.

    </p><p>The breakthrough came soon, as the next chapter uncovers.

    <a name="fn1"></a>1.&nbsp; Interference is a phenomenon in which
    two or more waves superpose to yield a resultant wave whose
    amplitude or intensity may be greater or less than the component
    waves.&nbsp; The striking colours on soap bubbles and oil slicks
    are due to interference of light waves.&nbsp; <a href="#fn1_back">Back</a> <br>
    <a name="fn2"></a>2.&nbsp; Wavelength is a measure of the length of
    a wave, and is given by the distance between two consecutive
    'crests' or 'troughs' of the wave.&nbsp; If you measure the
    distance between two 'heads' of a ripple in a pond as 10 cm, then
    its wavelength is said to be 10 cm.&nbsp; <a href="#fn2_back">Back</a>
