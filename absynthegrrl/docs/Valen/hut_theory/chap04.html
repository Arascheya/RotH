<div class="heading">Chapter 4: Niels Bohr and the Quantum Atom</div>
<p>
</p><div class="body">
    So far we have seen that quantum physics deals with electromagnetic
    radiation -- that is to say, light.&nbsp; But at the beginning we
    said that quantum physics tells us that <i>material things</i> are
    described by quantum physics.&nbsp;&nbsp; So what happened to
    matter? 

    <p>Niels Bohr happened to matter.&nbsp; Bohr was a Danish physicist
    whose parents were both scientists.&nbsp; Apparently young Niels
    grew up in an atmosphere that was favourable to science. He
    received his doctorate in 1911 from the University of Copenhagen.

    <hr>

    <p>One can see just by looking at Niels Bohr's early academic life
    (though there are many other indicators) that the 'atomic theory'
    of matter -- that is to say that matter is made up of tiny atoms --
    had gone from being scientifically marginalised to being at the
    heart of physics in a very short time.&nbsp; Bohr's doctoral thesis
    was concerned with the inadequacy of classical (that is to say,
    Newtonian) physics for describing the behaviour of matter at the
    atomic level.

    </p><p>In the 19th century, physicists who saw some value in the atomic
    theory thought of the atom as a tiny undivided and indivisible unit
    of matter, the smallest possible unit into which something could be
    broken down.&nbsp; Experiments dealing with the photoelectric
    effect, along with other observations, strongly suggested that the
    atom had some internal structure, since particles called
    'electrons' were being emitted from them.

    </p><h3>Rutherford's Model and Its Drawbacks</h3>
    A model of the atom was described by the British physicist Ernest
    Rutherford in 1911, and is known as the Solar System model.&nbsp;
    It is very simple, and is still used to teach elementary atomic
    structure to school children. 

    <ul>
      <li>An atom consists of a <i>central nucleus</i>.&nbsp; This
      nucleus is composed of <i>positively charged protons</i>, and
      electrically uncharged (<i>neutral</i>) <i>neutrons</i>.

      </li><li><i>Negatively charged electrons revolve round the nucleus in
      definite orbits</i>.

      </li><li>The orbits themselves can be <i>at any distance</i> from the
      nucleus.

      </li><li>In any atom, <i>the number of protons is equal to the number
      of electrons</i>, and hence it is electrically neutral.
    </li></ul>

    <p>Rutherford used the laws of motion that had been set forward by
    Sir Isaac Newton to describe the atom.&nbsp; According to
    Rutherford's description, the electrons of an atom could occupy one
    of an infinite number of orbits, in accordance with Newton's
    laws.&nbsp; There were problems with Rutherford's description of
    the atom from the beginning. Let us find out two drawbacks of
    Rutherford's theory.

    </p><h4><a name="fn1_back"></a>1. Inherent Instability of the Atom</h4>
    According to Rutherford's theory, electrons could orbit the nucleus
    at any distance.&nbsp; When the electrons circle round the nucleus,
    they are constantly changing their direction.&nbsp; According to
    classical electrodynamics (which deals with the motion of
    electrons), such electrons which either constantly change their
    direction or their velocity or both should continuously emit
    radiation.&nbsp; While doing so, they should lose energy, and thus
    spiral into the nucleus.&nbsp; This means <i>every atom is
    unstable</i>, quite contrary to our observation! [<a href="#fn1">1</a>]

    <h4>2. Atomic Spectra</h4>
    Rutherford's description of the atom could not be entirely correct
    because it did not account for some observations that had already
    been made.&nbsp; Perhaps the most important of these observations
    concerned the behaviour of certain gases.&nbsp; These gases at low
    pressure emit light in a set of <i>discrete bands</i> of the
    electromagnetic spectrum.&nbsp; This is quite different from the
    radiation emitted by solids, which is spread evenly across the
    electromagnetic spectrum.&nbsp; The radiation emissions of these
    gases were important because they showed that at least under some
    circumstances, the orbits of the electrons could not be at just any
    distance from the nucleus, but were confined to discrete distances
    (or <i>energy states</i>).

    <p>If the electrons in these gases were free to orbit at any
    distance, then the light emitted from them would have been spread
    evenly across the electromagnetic spectrum.&nbsp; Instead, what
    experimenters saw was that the light from these gases showed a
    distinct <i>line pattern</i>.&nbsp; That is to say that the light
    being emitted was only seen in a certain set of wavelengths, with
    empty spaces in between.

    </p><p>These line-spectra were different for each gas, and was found to
    be the characteristic of its atom. Today, astronomers use
    line-spectra to detect the elements present in stars.

    </p><h3><a name="fn2_back"></a>Bohr's Explanation</h3>
    Niels Bohr quickly seized upon this problem and used it to propose
    a <i>quantised</i> description of the atom. 

    <ol>
      <li>Bohr proposed that while circling the nucleus of the atom,
      electrons could only occupy certain <i>discrete</i> orbits, that
      is to say energy levels [<a href="#fn2">2</a>].&nbsp; Bohr used
      Max Planck's equations describing quanta of radiation to
      determine what these discrete orbits would have to be.&nbsp;
      <i>As long as electrons stay in these energy levels, they are
      stable.</i>

      </li><li>Further, Bohr said electrons give or take energy only when
      they change their energy levels. If they move up, they
      <i>take</i> energy (say from light), and if they move down, they
      <i>release</i> energy.&nbsp; This energy itself is released in
      discrete packets called <i>photons</i>, which were introduced in
      the previous chapter.

      </li><li>Furthermore, Bohr also said that an electron which is not in
      its native energy level (in other words, which has been
      <i>excited</i> to a higher energy level) <i>always</i> has to
      fall back to its original, stable level.
    </li></ol>
    Bohr interpreted the lines in the spectra of gases as formed by the
    <i>transitions</i> of electrons to and from various energy-levels.
    This has been verified thoroughly with the hydrogen atom, <i>and
    found to be correct</i>. Bohr's formulae agreed excellently with
    observed line positions.

    <p>Imagine that you are taking a walking along a beach.&nbsp; As
    you walk along, you see a sand-castle that someone has built.&nbsp;
    As you get closer to the sand castle, you discover that you can
    only stand three meters, two meters, or one meter from the sand
    castle.&nbsp; You cannot stand at one and a half meters, nor can
    you stand at two and three quarters of a meter from the sand
    castle.&nbsp; No matter how hard you try, some mysterious force
    keeps you at one of those three distances.&nbsp; In everyday life
    such a situation is absurdly impossible.&nbsp; In the physics of
    the very small, it is a necessity.

    </p><p>This description in which electrons can only occupy certain
    orbits is called the <i>shell model</i> of the atom, because Bohr
    described the possible orbits of the electrons as <i>orbitals</i>
    or <i>shells</i>.&nbsp; When an atom of a gas <i>released</i>
    energy, an electron would move <i>down</i> to a lower orbit
    (requiring less energy), and when an atom <i>acquired</i> energy,
    an electron would move <i>up</i> to a higher energy level.&nbsp;
    But these orbits or shells were <i>discrete</i>, like the distances
    from the sand castle.&nbsp; The orbits were not a smooth,
    continuous series of possibilities as one finds in the everyday
    world, but rather a set of <i>distinct states</i> separated from
    each other, much like the separation of the quanta of
    electromagnetic radiation that Planck had discovered.&nbsp; This
    caused the <i>distinct lines</i> in the spectrum.

    </p><p>For the first time, quantum physics had been applied to matter.

    </p><h5>Footnotes</h5>
    <a name="fn1"></a>1.&nbsp; Extending the same analogy, can we say
    the solar system is also unstable?&nbsp; Do planets going round the
    Sun also lose energy and spiral into the Sun in the same manner?
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer is <i>yes</i>.&nbsp; Radio-wave
    analysis from a dense double-star system called <i>PSR 1913+16</i>
    confirms energy loss at exactly the rate of spiralling-in
    corresponds to the theoretical prediction.&nbsp; But there is no
    cause to worry: unlike electrostatic forces, gravitational forces
    are the weakest forces in nature, and the Sun will die its natural
    death (in about 5 billion years from now) much before the Earth
    plunges into it!&nbsp; <a href="#fn1_back">Back</a>
    </p><p><a name="fn2"></a>2.&nbsp; Though this was just a postulate in
    Bohr's theory to aid the understanding of the atom, it would
    eventually be clarified.&nbsp; The next chapter explains how.&nbsp;
