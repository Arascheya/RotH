    This primer on quantum physics was written by <i>Thomas A.
    Haberkern</i> and <i>N Deepak</i> as a collaborative effort via the
    Internet. They have equally shared the job of writing the ten
    chapters which comprise this book. Additionally, HTML formatting
    and final touches were given by Deepak. 

    <p><b>Thomas Haberkern</b> currently offers computer support at St.
    Louis, MO USA, where he stays.&nbsp; Educated in St. Louis and
    Rome, Italy, Thomas is a voracious reader, and has profound
    knowledge and interest in a wide range of topics, theoretical
    physics being one of them.&nbsp; Thomas is 35, and single.

    </p><p>You can contact Thomas at: <a href="mailto:tomhaberkern@yahoo.com">tomhaberkern@yahoo.com</a>.

    </p><p><b>Deepak</b> is a student of computer science and engineering
    at Bangalore, India, currently in the seventh semester.&nbsp; He
    too loves to read books, and the idea for this work was suggested
    by him after a short e-mail discussion with Thomas on this
    matter.&nbsp; Deepak is 20, and it is illegal not to be single at
    this age in India.
