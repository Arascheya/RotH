    For centuries, man has wondered on phenomena and processes
    happening around him.&nbsp; As time passed, he was successful in
    applying his intuition and common sense in comprehending the stars,
    galaxies and their behaviour, but they fail in the microscopic
    world of molecules, atoms and sub-atomic particles. <br>
    <a name="fn1_back"></a> <br>
    <i>Quantum theory provides us with the rules and regulations of the
    miniature world</i>.&nbsp; These rules are phenomenally successful
    in accounting for the properties of atoms, molecules, and their
    constituents, and form the basis of understanding the fundamental
    properties of all matter.&nbsp; In fact, one may say that the
    greatest success story of the 20th-century physics is to confirm
    that this theory works, without a single exception, in spite of
    critical examination by some of the best minds spanning decades of
    time. 

    <p>Yet, the conceptual foundation of quantum theory is
    mysterious.&nbsp; It led to intense debates among scientists, and
    confused many.&nbsp; Niels Bohr, one of the most prominent
    scientists in this domain, once remarked, 'You have not studied
    quantum mechanics [<a href="#fn1">1</a>] well if you aren't
    confused by it.'&nbsp; Albert Einstein, the greatest physicist of
    the 20th century, never approved of this theory.&nbsp; Bizarre
    though it may seem, quantum physics has led physicists step by step
    to a deeper view of the reality, and has answered many fundamental
    questions.

    </p><p>In the following chapters we shall touch upon several
    fascinating areas of the quantum world.&nbsp; Our attempt is to
    help the reader understand the fundamental concepts of quantum
    physics without the underlying mathematics.&nbsp; We try not to be
    physicists, but only to have an understanding of what physicists
    know of our world.&nbsp; That goal is within our grasp.

    </p><p>Welcome aboard, to the quantum world!

    </p><h5>Footnotes</h5>
    <a name="fn1"></a>1.&nbsp; Usually one sees the term <i>quantum
    mechanics</i> used rather than <i>quantum physics</i>. This is
    directly related to Isaac Newton's original ideas.&nbsp; Newton
    conceived of the universe as a vast machine, and so in Newtonian
    physics one could speak of the 'mechanics' or machine-like workings
    of the universe.&nbsp; 'Quantum mechanics' is simply the same idea
    applied to the world of atoms and sub-atomic particles -- though
    the machine-like workings of the quantum world are very different
    from those of the Newtonian world.
