    <h3>Applications of Quantum Physics</h3>
    Inspite of all the fights and debates, quantum physics has been
    successful not only in explaining many physical phenomena, but also
    in predicting newer ones.&nbsp; For example, it correctly predicted
    that hydrogen could exist in two types, depending on the relative
    orientation of the angular momentum of the nucleus.&nbsp; The
    physicist Paul Dirac was also able to employ it in 1927 to make a
    novel prediction of the existence of particles similar in mass and
    spin to electrons, but with opposite electric charge.&nbsp; The
    particles, which have come to be known as positrons, were
    discovered subsequently by Carl Anderson in 1932.&nbsp; They were
    the first example of <i>antiparticles</i>, many of which would be
    discovered in the coming decades and are still being discovered. 

    <p>Research that employs quantum physics remains at the centre of
    contemporary physics.&nbsp; One aspect of this research involves
    the search for approximate methods that can be applied with the
    basic principles of quantum physics in studies of situations that
    are so complex that they cannot be dealt with exactly.&nbsp; Much
    of the research in condensed-matter physics is of this
    nature.&nbsp; An important discovery in this area is that in some
    situations the discreteness of physical quantities that usually
    occurs on the subatomic level can also occur on the macroscopic
    level.&nbsp; The quantised Hall effect, a property of electrical
    resistance of certain substances under the influence of electrical
    and magnetic forces, is a recently discovered example of this.

    </p><p>Today, quantum physics plays an increasingly important role in
    our life.&nbsp; We have already named some of the applications in
    their context in the previous chapters.&nbsp; Lasers, for instance,
    are a direct application of Bohr's theory.&nbsp; If you are reading
    an electronic version of this page on a computer, then the
    microprocessor on which it runs is ultimately based on Bohr's
    theory.&nbsp; Much of the microelectronic devices, indeed the
    electronic revolution itself, is indebted to quantum physics.&nbsp;
    Scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) is another very useful device
    based on a concept known as <i>barrier tunnelling</i>, which is
    derived from quantum theoretical principles.

    </p><h3>Quantum Theory, Relativity and the Standard Model</h3>
    Quantum theory, nevertheless, has not been successful
    everywhere.&nbsp; An important area of research involves the
    attempt to include gravity among the phenomena that can be
    described by quantum physics. 

    <p>It has been learnt that there are three fundamental forces (also
    known as interactions) that govern the world of the very small:
    electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear
    force.&nbsp; The zoo of subatomic particles, along with the
    understanding of these three fundamental forces, combined with the
    laws of the quantum world today make up what is commonly called the
    <i>Standard Model of Particle Physics</i>.&nbsp; For a very
    specific reason it is clear that the Standard Model is not a
    complete theory.

    </p><p>In order for the Standard Model to be a complete theory, it
    would have to be able to account for all objects, events, and
    forces which come under its purview.&nbsp; There is one force which
    is not incorporated into the Standard Model:&nbsp;
    <i>Gravitation</i>.&nbsp; The gravitational force is so weak at
    subatomic levels that it can safely be ignored in most
    calculations.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there are circumstances under
    which the gravitational force is strong enough on very small scales
    that it cannot be ignored.&nbsp; Two of these cases that have been
    frequently noted are the singularity at the centre of a black hole,
    and on the very small scale but high density conditions of the Big
    Bang at the beginning of the Universe.

    </p><p>Gravitation is very well described by Albert Einstein's General
    Theory of Relativity; it works so well, in fact, that even though
    it has been tested under very many conditions in very many
    experiments, virtually no exceptions have been found to the
    theory.&nbsp; On the other hand, relativity is a 'classical'
    theory, in the sense that it deals with smooth continuities and so
    has not been 'quantised.'&nbsp; <i>Every attempt so far to bring
    quantum theory and relativity into agreement has failed for various
    mathematical reasons</i>.

    </p><p>One possible exception can be made to this rule.&nbsp; There is
    a branch of particle physics called <i>Superstring Theory</i>,
    which describes subatomic particles not as dimensionless points but
    as <i>one-dimensional strings</i> (of various lengths with various
    properties, some of the open like a line, others closed in a
    loop).&nbsp; Superstring theory is not only very elegant in a
    mathematical sense; it also includes a mathematical equivalent of
    Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.&nbsp; The only problem is
    that Superstring Theory cannot be tested with any existing
    experimental equipment -- in fact, nobody can even imagine what
    sort of equipment can be used to test it.

    </p><p>For the present, the Standard Model in general and quantum
    physics must remain incomplete.&nbsp; Still, there is much work to
    be done within the framework that physicists already have, and
    indeed one day someone working on the edge of physics (as Planck,
    Einstein and others were doing a century ago) may make a
    breakthrough discovery that will lead to yet another new age of our
    understanding of the physical world.&nbsp; Meanwhile, there is no
    doubt that quantum physics is the most successful theory of
    physical phenomena yet invented by the human mind.
