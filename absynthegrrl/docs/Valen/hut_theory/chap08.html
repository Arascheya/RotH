<div class="heading">Chapter 8: Quantum Paradoxes</div>

</p><div class="body">
    The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, introduced in the
    previous chapter, met with considerable resistance.&nbsp; Many
    physicists, including Einstein and Schrödinger, who accepted
    the mathematical formulation of quantum physics, were uncomfortable
    with this interpretation, and criticised it.&nbsp; The question of
    the correct interpretation of the mathematical formalism has
    remained something of a problem even today. 

    <p>Much of the criticism to the Copenhagen interpretation came in
    the form of 'thought experiments', which could only be conducted in
    theory.&nbsp; These experiments were designed to demonstrate
    'flaws' in the probabilistic interpretation, and formed the themes
    of intense debates.&nbsp; In this chapter, we shall study two such
    important paradoxes arising from the Copenhagen interpretation.

    </p><h3><a name="fn1_back"></a>Schrödinger's Cat Paradox</h3>
    In 1935, Schrödinger wrote a criticism of the standard view of
    quantum mechanics and illustrated with the example of a cat.&nbsp;
    This has since been known as the Schrödinger's cat
    paradox.&nbsp; In order to understand the concept easily, we shall
    explain the setup stepwise. 

    <ol>
      <li>
        Imagine a perfectly sealed box containing: 

        <ol type="i">
          <li>a cat, and

          </li><li>a device with a deadly poison (say potassium cyanide)
        </li></ol>

      </li><li>A quantum event, namely the disintegration of a radioactive
      atom [<a href="#fn1">1</a>], triggers the poison device.

      </li><li>There is a 50% chance that the radioactive substance decays
      in one hour.
    </li></ol>

    <p>The question is: <i>What is the state of the cat inside the
    box?</i>

    </p><p>This whole system with the cat in the box which could be either
    alive or dead and the radioisotope and the poison can be described
    by a wave-function (in which the dead/alive states of the cat are
    mathematically superposed).&nbsp; According to Bohr, the cat is
    neither dead nor alive, but in an <i>indeterminate</i> state which
    is neither.&nbsp; The act of opening the box and looking in
    actually causes the wave-function to <i>collapse</i> into one
    determinate state -- dead cat or live cat.&nbsp; It is actually the
    act of observation which determines the poor cat's fate.&nbsp; But
    in reality the cat can be either dead or alive; there is no
    indeterminate state as such.

    </p><h3><a name="fn2_back"></a>Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen Paradox
    (EPR Paradox)</h3>
    Einstein attempted to demonstrate incompleteness of the standard
    quantum mechanical description of physical reality in a famous
    paper written with B. Podolsky and N. Rosen, where a thought
    experiment is described with persuasive reasoning.

    <ol>
      <li>Let us consider a particle at rest.&nbsp; Let us say this
      particle is inherently unstable, and disintegrates into two
      particles. (In reality, there exist particles of this kind. An
      example is <i>pi-zero</i>, which decays into two photons and has
      a lifetime of a tiny fraction of a second.)

      </li><li>The fundamental laws of conservation, which are valid for all
      systems, guarantee that momentum and angular momentum [<a href="#fn2">2</a>] must be conserved.&nbsp; That is, the sum total of
      these quantities for the two particles remains the same before
      and after the disintegration.

      </li><li>Hence we can say that the momentum and angular momentum of
      the two resulting particles must be equal and opposite, since
      before disintegration they were equal to zero.

      </li><li>Therefore, measurement of the momentum of one particle can be
      used to deduce the value of the momentum of the partner.&nbsp;
      Alternatively one can deduce the position of the target particle
      with certainty and unlimited accuracy by making a position
      measurement on its partner.

      </li><li>This trick would bypass the uncertainty principle and show
      that the quantum theory is incomplete.
    </li></ol>
    The statement that measurements done on one part of the separated
    system should not affect the other part of the system has been
    known as the <i>reality condition</i>. 

    <p>The EPR paper was a powerful challenge to the Copenhagen
    group.&nbsp; Bohr refuted EPR by reiterating his philosophy:&nbsp;
    what is important is the whole set of conditions under which the
    measurement is made.&nbsp; He said that in the EPR scenario, <i>the
    two particles form an irreducible quantum system with one wave
    function which incorporates both particles</i>.&nbsp; Although no
    direct signal can travel between them, still one cannot ignore the
    influence of measurements on one or the other.

    </p><p>Einstein could never agree with this idea, calling it 'ghostly
    action at a distance'.&nbsp; But a physicist named John Bell proved
    in 1964 that Einstein's reality condition necessarily implies a
    relation among the results of a series of measurements. Numerous
    experiments have since been carried out to test Einstein's reality
    condition as well as Bell's theorem, and the results have proved
    that Einstein was <i>wrong</i>, and quantum physics was right.

    </p><p>Nevertheless, Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation was (and still
    is) not the only explanation for quantum phenomena, and even today
    scientists do not seem to agree on any one interpretation.&nbsp; In
    the next chapter, we shall look at some of the alternative theories
    proposed for quantum mechanics.

    <a name="fn1"></a>1.&nbsp; Radioactivity is a natural phenomenon in
    which an atom disintegrates by emitting certain particles.&nbsp;
    Since the resulting atom has a different configuration, it exhibits
    the properties of a different element.&nbsp; For example, uranium
    disintegrates into thorium by emitting what is called an
    alpha-particle.&nbsp; <a href="#fn1_back">Back</a> <br>
    <a name="fn2"></a>2.&nbsp; Momentum is defined as the product of
    the mass and velocity of a body.&nbsp; It is a measure of the
    energy of a moving body, and is zero for a body at rest.&nbsp;
    Angular momentum is a similar measure for rotating objects.&nbsp;
