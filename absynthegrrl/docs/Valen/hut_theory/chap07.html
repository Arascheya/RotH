    <h3>Schrödinger's Wave Equation</h3>
    We introduced you to the wave-like nature of matter particles, or
    <i>matter waves</i>, in Chapter 5.&nbsp; Erwin Schrödinger, an
    exceptionally gifted Austrian physicist, explored the consequences
    of these matter waves and proposed a <i>wave equation</i> for them,
    analogous to the known equations for other wave motions in
    nature.&nbsp; This wave equation describes how a wave associated
    with an electron or other subatomic particle varies in space and
    time as the particle moves under various forces.

      <b>Erwin Schrödinger</b>
    </center>
    <hr>

    <p>Schrödinger's theory of the quantum world is called <i>wave
    mechanics</i>.&nbsp; He worked out the exact solutions of the wave
    equation for the hydrogen atom, and the results perfectly agreed
    with the known energy levels of these atoms, seemingly without any
    of the complications and metaphysical speculations associated with
    the uncertainty principle.&nbsp; Moreover, the equation could also
    be applied to more complicated atoms, and even to particles not
    bound in atoms at all.&nbsp; It was soon found that in <i>every</i>
    case, Schrödinger's equation gave a correct description of a
    particle's behaviour, provided it was not moving at a speed near
    that of light. [<a href="#fn1">1</a>]

    </p><p>In spite of this success, the very meaning of the waves remained
    unclear.&nbsp; Schrödinger believed that the intensity of the
    wave at a point in space represented the 'amount' of the electron
    that was present at that point.&nbsp; In other words, the electron
    was spread out, rather than concentrated at a point.&nbsp; However,
    it was soon found that this interpretation was untenable, because
    observations revealed that particles never spread out.&nbsp; For
    example, it follows from the wave equation that when a wave,
    representing an electron, strikes a target, it spreads out in
    <i>all directions</i>.&nbsp; Experimentally, on the other hand, the
    electron scatters in some <i>specific</i> direction but <i>never
    breaks up</i>.

    </p><h3>Max Born's Interpretation of the Wave Equation</h3>
    <hr>

    <center>
      <b>Max Born</b>
    </center>
    <hr>
    Max Born, another German physicist and a good friend of Einstein,
    interpreted this result as follows:&nbsp; the wave associated with
    the electron is not a tangible 'matter wave', but one that
    determines the <i>probability</i> of scattering of the electron in
    different directions.&nbsp; Where the associated wave has a large
    amplitude, the probability of finding an electron there is
    high.&nbsp; In any case, one would find the <i>whole</i> particle,
    and not parts of it. 

    <p>This indicated that the simple interpretation of the wave
    equation as a description of the physical matter waves in ordinary
    space, as was originally assumed by Schrödinger himself, is
    incorrect.&nbsp; Born noted the following conclusions:

    </p><ol>
      <li>Matter waves represent <i>probability amplitudes</i>
      associated with the occurrence of an event.

      </li><li>If there are multiple alternatives for the event to happen,
      the total amplitude is the sum of the <i>alternative</i>
      amplitudes.

      </li><li>Finally, the absolute square of the overall amplitude, the
      <i>intensity</i> of the wave, must be interpreted as the
      <i>probability that the event will happen</i>.
    </li></ol>
    Thus Max Born reduced Schrödinger's equation completely into
    probabilistic terms, although Schrödinger himself was
    reluctant to accept this interpretation, and retained this
    reservation for the rest of his life. 

    <p>This difference between the world of the very small and the
    everyday world we experience cannot be understated.&nbsp; When you
    are walking across a street and an automobile is approaching you,
    it is at a definite place at any given time, and it is possible to
    describe with a great deal of <i>precision</i> where exactly the
    automobile is, and where it will be at another moment in time if it
    continues on the same path.&nbsp; For objects in the realm of the
    very small, this is simply <i>not</i> possible.

    </p><p>These discoveries are at the heart of quantum physics.&nbsp; The
    importance of the introduction of statistical probabilities into
    physical law cannot be understated.&nbsp; In earlier physics, that
    is to say the classical mechanics of Isaac Newton, probabilities
    had no place.&nbsp; In the Newtonian world-view, an object of any
    kind could at least in theory be described as having a definite
    position at any given time.&nbsp; This was not the case at all in
    the new quantum theory: <i>the probabilities describing material
    particles could never be replaced by old-style definite
    positions</i>.

    </p><h3><a name="fn2_back"></a>A Probabilistic World</h3>
    Applying these points to an electron in an atom, nevertheless, we
    see that the electron is no longer a point in space moving along a
    definite path, but a <i>cloud of probabilities</i> [<a href="#fn2">2</a>].&nbsp; In other words, one cannot say that an
    electron will be in this position at this point of time, but one
    can only say like this: 'It is 95% probable that the electron will
    be at this position at this point of time.'&nbsp; Similarly, <i>to
    every point in a light wave we can attach a numerical probability
    (per unit time interval) that a photon can be detected in any small
    volume centred on that point</i>, and light is viewed as a
    <i>probability wave</i>.

    <p>With de Broglie's principle, we can also extend this to
    electrons and all other matter particles, and hence account for
    their wave nature (and hence the double-slit experiment).&nbsp;
    They have been experimentally found to be correct;&nbsp; in 1994,
    interference fringes, a typical characteristic of waves, were
    generated with beams of iodine <i>molecules</i>, which are about
    500,000 times more massive than electrons.

    </p><p>By 1930s, this indeterministic interpretation of quantum
    physics, mainly put forward by Niels Bohr with support from Born's
    probability interpretation and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,
    came to be known as the <i>Copenhagen interpretation</i>, mainly
    because Bohr ran an influential physics institute there during this
    period.&nbsp; What happened next is dealt with in the next chapter.

    <a name="fn1"></a>1.&nbsp; At speeds comparable to that of light,
    particles begin to behave strangely.&nbsp; That, however, is a part
    of the relativity theory, and we shall not touch upon the
    matter.&nbsp; <a href="#fn1_back">Back</a> <br>
     <a name="fn2"></a>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is impossible to give an
    everyday world analogy for this 'cloud of probabilities'.&nbsp;
    Nevertheless, this is the best description of how these particles
    exist and behave. <a href="#fn2_back">Back</a>
