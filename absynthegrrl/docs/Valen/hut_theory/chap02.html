    <a name="fn12_back"></a> Over three hundred years ago, Sir Isaac
    Newton revolutionised the study of the natural world by putting
    forth laws of nature that were stated in mathematical form for the
    first time.&nbsp; Newton's book, <i>The Mathematical Principles of
    Natural Philosophy</i> [<a href="#fn1">1</a>] forever changed how
    scholars would study the physical world.&nbsp; Newton's formulation
    of physical laws was so powerful that his equations are still in
    use today. [<a href="#fn2">2</a>] 

    <p>By the start of the 20th century, physicists had worked with
    Newton's laws so thoroughly that some of them thought that they
    were coming to the end of physics.&nbsp; In their opinion, not much
    was left to do to make physics a complete system.&nbsp; Little did
    they know that the world they described was soon to be understood
    in a completely different way.&nbsp; The <i>quantum revolution</i>
    was about to happen.

    </p><p>This revolution was begun by a very unlikely person, a physicist
    named <i>Max Planck</i>, who was very conservative in all his
    views.&nbsp; It speaks well of Planck's intellectual honesty that
    he was able to accept the reality of what he discovered, even
    though he found the consequences of his discoveries distasteful and
    unpleasant for the rest of his life.

      <b>Max Planck <sup>*</sup></b>

    <a name="fn34_back"></a> 

    <p>Born in 1853, Max Planck came from a conservative and
    respectable family in Kiel, Germany.&nbsp; Young Max was very
    bright, and had a variety of fields from which to choose to study
    for his professional life.&nbsp; Planck chose physics because he
    felt that it was the field in which he was most likely to do some
    original work.&nbsp; At the young age of 21, he received his
    doctorate in physics from the University of Munich.

    </p><p>Planck was investigating the properties of heat- and
    light-emitting bodies.&nbsp; Classical physics had theories which
    predicted that the brightness of a body <i>increases
    continuously</i> as the frequency [<a href="#fn3">3</a>] of its
    electromagnetic radiation [<a href="#fn4">4</a>] is increased.
    </p><hr>

    </center>

    <center>
      <b>Fig. 2-1: Intensity vs. Frequency Plot</b>
    </center>
    <hr>

    <p>Unfortunately, experiments revealed a totally different picture.
    <i>The brightness did increase initially, but only upto a
    limit.&nbsp; Then, actually, it began to fall</i>.&nbsp; We thus
    get a bell-shaped curve if we plot frequency against brightness.

    </p><p>Besides, another observation was made: <i>as bodies become
    hotter, their maximum brightness shifts towards higher
    frequencies</i>.&nbsp; This is why an object, heated to 300-400 C,
    emits mostly infra-red or heat waves.&nbsp; As the temperature is
    increased, the object appears to be red, then orange, and finally
    white or even blue.

    </p><p>Classical theories totally failed to explain this discrepancy
    between the known facts and the observations.&nbsp; Then, in the
    winter of 1900, Max Planck found a solution to this problem.&nbsp;
    Planck ushered in the quantum era by making a bizarre assumption:

    </p><center>
      <p><i>Emission and absorption of energy can occur only in
      discrete amounts.</i>
    </p></center>

    <p>This might seem totally unsurprising to you, but believe me, it
    shook the scientists of that period.&nbsp; Planck himself did not
    know he would end up with this statement!

    </p><p>Imagine for a moment that you are a sculptor, and you have
    obtained a piece of stone in the shape of a cube.&nbsp; To begin
    your sculpture, you take a chisel and place its edge against the
    stone, and then strike the chisel with a hammer.&nbsp; What do you
    imagine would happen?&nbsp; I think you would imagine that a piece
    of the stone would be split off, as well as some smaller splinters
    and pieces of stone.&nbsp; Imagine instead that when you struck the
    stone, it broke into hundreds of small cubes, each one of them
    exactly the same size, 3 centimeters per side.&nbsp; Wouldn't you
    be surprised, even shocked?&nbsp; Imagine furthermore that no
    matter how hard you tried, these smaller cubes could not be broken
    into smaller pieces at all!

    </p><p>We think that the reaction that a sculptor would have in such a
    circumstance would be similar to what Planck and other physicists
    felt upon discovering that energy only occurred in discrete
    amounts.&nbsp; It was a completely unexpected discovery, and yet it
    was only the beginning of what would come later.

    </p><p>Planck called these discrete lumps as <i>quanta</i>.&nbsp; This
    was against the entire world-view that had been built from the time
    of Newton onward.&nbsp; In the physics that had been built up since
    the time of Newton, and indeed in the minds of most thinkers before
    Newton, matter and energy were thought to be smooth and
    continuous.&nbsp; Even by the time of Planck, the idea that matter
    could be ultimately broken down into tiny indivisible 'atoms' was
    only held by a few physicists.

    </p><p>And so the quantum revolution began.

    </p><h5>Footnotes</h5>
    <a name="fn1"></a>1.&nbsp; <i>Natural Philosophy</i> was the term
    used in Isaac Newton's time for what we now call 'the
    sciences'.&nbsp; 'Science' would only become distinct from
    philosophy much later.&nbsp; The term 'scientist' was only coined
    in the middle of the 19th century.&nbsp; <a href="#fn12_back">Back</a> 

    <p><a name="fn2"></a>2.&nbsp; Newton's physics gave a very good
    understanding of the working of gravity, as well as other natural
    phenomena.&nbsp; Although Newton's interpretation of his
    discoveries has mostly been abandoned, the mathematical laws that
    he discovered are close enough to what is actually found in the
    real world that they are still useful for many things, from
    engineering to astrophysics.&nbsp; <a href="#fn12_back">Back</a>

    </p><p><a name="fn3"></a>3.&nbsp; Frequency is a term associated with
    waves, and refers to the number of waves that pass through a point
    in a given time interval. For example, if you can count three
    'heads' of ripples pass by you in a pond in ten seconds, then the
    frequency is 3/10 Hz.&nbsp; Hertz is the unit of frequency.&nbsp;
    <a href="#fn34_back">Back</a>

    </p><p><a name="fn4"></a>4.&nbsp; Electromagnetic radiation consists of
    fluctuating electric and magnetic fields.&nbsp; In the increasing
    order of frequency, radio waves, microwaves, infra-red radiation,
    the visible light (red through violet), ultra-violet radiation, X
    rays and gamma rays are all electromagnetic waves.&nbsp; They are
    caused by changes in the electric field or the magnetic field, and
    they travel at the speed of light, which is 300,000 km per
    second.&nbsp; <a href="#fn34_back">Back</a>
