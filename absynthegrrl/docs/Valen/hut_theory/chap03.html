    In the previous chapter we told you about Max Planck and how he
    introduced the 'quantum' concept to radiation.&nbsp; This resolved
    the radiation problem but initially it did not attract much
    attention, mainly because the idea was so out of line with the then
    current thinking, and nobody had <i>practically</i> found
    independent evidence for the existence of the quantum.&nbsp; That
    was left to the genius of Einstein.&nbsp; He was responsible for
    the second coming of the quantum. <br>
    <a name="fn1_back"></a> <br>
    One of the most recognised faces of the last century is that of
    Albert Einstein.&nbsp; Very many people know a little about
    Einstein, the eccentric old genius with the fright-wig hairstyle
    and rumpled clothing.&nbsp; Many people are also aware of his great
    intelligence.&nbsp; In some parts of the English-speaking world,
    the word 'Einstein' has become a generic term referring to a very
    intelligent person.

    <p>People who know something about science are also aware of his
    theories of relativity:&nbsp; the Special Theory of Relativity
    (published in 1905) and the General Theory of Relativity (published
    in 1915).&nbsp; What many people do not know is that Einstein was
    the second person to make a major contribution to the quantum
    revolution, in a paper also published in 1905 [<a href="#fn1">1</a>].&nbsp; In fact, this paper won him a Nobel prize.<br>
    <a name="fb3_back"></a><br>
    The paper in question was about the nature of light [<a href="#fn2">2</a>].&nbsp; Albert Einstein's contribution to this
    discussion was a theoretical explanation of a certain phenomenon,
    which showed that light was a stream of particles (which would
    later be named <i>photons</i>).

    </p><p>This phenomenon is called the <i>photoelectric effect</i>.&nbsp;
    When you shine a light upon certain metals, a stream of particles
    (later found to be electrons [<a href="#fb3">3</a>]) is emitted
    from that metal. The emission has been found to have certain
    properties.

    </p><ol>
      <li>The <i>number</i> of electrons emitted by the metal depends
      on the <i>intensity</i> of the light beam applied on the
      metal;&nbsp; more intense the beam, higher the number of
      electrons emitted.

      </li><li>The emitted electrons move with greater <i>speed</i> if the
      applied light has a higher <i>frequency</i>.

      </li><li>No electron is emitted until the light has a <i>threshold</i>
      frequency, <i>no matter how intense the light is</i>.
    </li></ol>
    These observations baffled physicists for many decades, since they
    cannot be explained if light is thought of only as a wave. 
    <p>If light were to be a wave, <i>both</i> the energy and the number
    of the electrons emitted from the metal should increase with an
    increase in the intensity of light.&nbsp; Observations contradicted
    this prediction; only the number, and not the energy, of the
    electrons increased with the increase of the intensity of the
    light.

    <p>What Einstein showed was that the photoelectric effect as it had
    been observed could be explained if individual particles (or
    <i>quanta</i>) of light were penetrating the metal and knocking
    electrons loose from atoms. <i>According to Einstein's paper,
    increasing the intensity of the light increased the number of
    photons, while the energy of each individual photon remained the
    same, as long as the frequency of the light remained the
    same</i>.&nbsp; Therefore the number of electrons emitted would
    increase, but the energy transmitted to them by the particles of
    light would remain the same.

    </p><p>In one stroke Einstein showed that light is a stream of
    particles, and also that there was solid evidence for the existence
    of quanta.&nbsp; His theory could satisfactorily explain all the
    known properties of the photoelectric effect, and was the first
    result derived from quantum theory of the interaction between
    radiation and matter.

    </p><p>The same theory also raises a fundamental question:&nbsp; is
    light ultimately a <i>wave</i>, or <i>a stream of photons</i>?

    </p><p>The answer is: <i>both</i>.&nbsp; Light behaves as a wave under
    certain conditions, and as a stream of particles under
    others.&nbsp; It is said to have a <i>dual nature</i>:&nbsp; we can
    understand it as either wave or particle, depending on our context
    of observation.&nbsp; If you are wondering why this is so, rest
    assured that this matter will be clarified later, in Chapter 7.

    <i>Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes
    betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt</i> or, in English, <i>On
    a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation
    of Light</i>.&nbsp; <a href="#fn1_back">Back</a>

    <i>light</i>, we are actually referring to visible light.&nbsp;
    Visible light, however, is only a small part of the electromagnetic
    spectrum, which ranges all the way from radio waves to gamma
    radiation.&nbsp; Every kind of radiation on the electromagnetic
    spectrum is really the same thing, only with different wavelengths
    and frequencies.&nbsp; <a href="#fn2_back">Back</a>
