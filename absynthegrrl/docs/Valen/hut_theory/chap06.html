</p><div class="body">
    In 1927, a German physicist by name Werner Heisenberg proved
    rigorously from quantum theory a very unsettling truth.&nbsp; He
    discovered that: 

    <p><i>Because of the very nature of subatomic objects, it is
    impossible, even in theory, to know with arbitrary precision both
    the position and velocity of any given wave / particle;&nbsp;
    position and velocity can only be described in terms of
    probabilities</i>.

    </p><p>It cannot be overstated that this limitation is not caused by
    any technological or theoretical failure; it is simply the
    <i>nature</i> of the quantum world to be
    <i>indeterminate</i>.&nbsp; Suppose we try to pin down the exact
    location of an electron through a microscope.&nbsp; If we have to
    'see' the electron, it means the electron should scatter the light
    into our eyes, or some other light-detector.&nbsp; But we learnt
    that if the electron absorbs a photon, it gains energy and is
    disturbed.&nbsp; It induces an uncertainty in the particle's
    <i>velocity</i>.&nbsp; On the other hand, if we try to use a
    low-energy beam of light, we cannot determine the <i>position</i>
    of the electron with surety.

    <p>Thus the fundamental laws of nature conspire to keep the
    objective reality of the atomic and sub-atomic world veiled from
    us.&nbsp; For example, electrons around an atomic nucleus appear to
    be in a hazy cloud.&nbsp; The sharp paths or orbits remain forever
    hidden from us.

    </p><p>This principle applies equally to any object, but its effect is
    negligible for an object of everyday size.&nbsp; In fact, ordinary
    experimental uncertainties harm the observation much more than
    Heisenberg's principle!&nbsp; This is the reason why Newtonian
    classical physics was so successful in explaining real-world
    phenomena.

    </p><p>Any observation disturbs a system under study;&nbsp; in
    non-quantum systems one can reduce the disturbance
    arbitrarily.&nbsp; In any case, one can compute, at least in
    principle, effects of the disturbance dictated by deterministic
    laws and subtract them out.&nbsp; This is impossible in the quantum
    domain <i>even in principle</i>.

    </p><p>Many physicists working at the time of the quantum revolution
    found this fact very difficult to accept.&nbsp; One notable figure
    was Albert Einstein himself, who refused even to his dying day that
    any part of the universe could be indeterminate by nature.&nbsp;
    Part of the reason for this difficulty is that most of the
    physicists of that time had been trained in classical mechanics,
    which very much shaped their thinking.&nbsp; The other part of the
    difficulty is that it is impossible for the human mind to imagine
    something that is actually indeterminate.&nbsp; In the world of
    human experience, we only find determinate things.&nbsp; For
    example, you will never find a cat which is neither alive nor dead,
    but in an in-between indeterminate state.&nbsp; All cats are either
    alive or dead; indeed, all macroscopic objects have a determinate
    state which can be observed and described (at least in
    theory).&nbsp; This is in no way true of the quantum world which
    had been discovered.

    </p><p>In time physicists learnt to accept the fact of indeterminacy,
    even though they could not imagine it.&nbsp; The ones who could not
    accept it eventually died.&nbsp; At the beginning of the
    twenty-first century, there are virtually no physicists who reject
    quantum physics.&nbsp; There is certainly disagreement about the
    meaning of quantum physics, but that is really more a matter of
    philosophy.

    </p><p>Once physicists realised that quantum hypothesis is not
    compatible with determinism -- this was the breakthrough -- they
    tried to find answers to the objections raised in Bohr's model
    differently.&nbsp; The next chapter explains how.
