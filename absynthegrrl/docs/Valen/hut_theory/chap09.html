<div class="heading">Chapter 9: Alternative Interpretations</div>
<p>
</p><div class="body">
    In the last chapter we told you that Bohr's explanation of quantum
    physics faced criticism from several scientists;&nbsp; we also
    discussed two paradoxes arising out of this interpretation.&nbsp;
    In this chapter we shall look at two important alternative
    interpretations of the quantum theory. 

    <h3>Hidden Variable Theory</h3>
    David Bohm wrote a text book on quantum physics as a young
    scientist at Princeton University.&nbsp; Although he focussed on
    the Copenhagen interpretation in his book, he was not satisfied
    with the inherent probabilistic and subjective nature of this
    interpretation. 

    <p>Because an individual radioactive nucleus will eventually decay
    at a specific time, Einstein and others believed that a complete
    physical theory should allow this time to be predicted exactly,
    rather than just statistically.&nbsp; Bohm became a leading
    proponent of the 'hidden variable' theory, which restores
    determinancy at the quantum level.&nbsp; Whereas in Bohr's
    interpretation quantum events are predicted
    probabilistically,&nbsp; in hidden variable theories there exist
    'hidden' properties, that is properties which we cannot measure,
    which determine events about quantum physics.

    </p><p>In Bohm's interpretation, the Schrödinger wave function is
    treated almost like a classical force field, such as a magnetic
    force field or gravitation.&nbsp; A term called 'quantum potential'
    is also introduced, just as we know about electric and magnetic
    potential.&nbsp; The wave function guides the particles along their
    paths, just as a magnetic field causes magnetic substances to move
    in a particular fashion.

    </p><p>The mathematician John von Neumann proved long ago that no
    hidden variable theory can agree exactly with the predictions of
    quantum physics.&nbsp; Not all the predictions have been examined,
    however, so there exists some possibility a hidden variable theory
    could be formulated that agrees with all observations that have
    been made.&nbsp; None has yet been produced that physicists find
    satisfactory.

    </p><h3>The Many-Worlds Interpretation</h3>
    As we have seen earlier, the central problem of the measurement
    process in quantum physics is to understand how a measurement
    selects one of the many options the system has at that point. 

    <p>Based on a work of H. Everett in 1957, J. A. Wheeler and D.
    DeWitt suggested that all available choices are indeed realised at
    measurement -- the universe splits into copies of equally real
    universes, each containing one of the possible choices!&nbsp;
    Additionally, these almost identical parallel universes coexisting
    in time and space cannot communicate with each other.&nbsp; This
    proliferation of copies of the entire universe is repeated each
    time a measurement is made!

    </p><p>At its face value this incredible suggestion is untestable.

    </p><p>The point of all this is to avoid the 'reduction' or 'collapse'
    hypothesis of the standard interpretation of quantum physics.&nbsp;
    Another possible virtue is to address the 'fine-tuning problem'
    which tries to understand why many of the parameters in our
    universe are adjusted in their values to generate the observed
    properties of matter.&nbsp; A many-worlds interpretation hypothesis
    would be that all possible values of these paramters actually occur
    in parallel universes;&nbsp; we happen to reside on the one with
    finely-tuned parameters.&nbsp; But the other universes with
    different parameters will have very different properties and
    evolution processes and cannot be the almost identical copies
    needed to avoid the reduction hypothesis!<br>
    &nbsp;

    </p><p>Quantum physics is now over 70 years old and has been very
    successful in providing explanations for physical phenomena, with
    the prevailing Copenhagen interpretation.&nbsp; Much of the
    criticism it has faced derives from the radical change from earlier
    theories that quantum physics represents.&nbsp; Some of it involves
    problems that arise within quantum physics itself.&nbsp; The
    question of the correct interpretation of the mathematical
    formalism has remained something of a problem up to the
    present.&nbsp; For now, we shall leave the matter there, and take
    up the current status of this subject in the next chapter.
