<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Chapter 2</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The transition from hyperspace to real-space snapped Valen out of her nightmares. Her eyes flashed around the strange surroundings, taking in the small chamber, emergency medical equipment, and her general state. Sound and vibrations reminded her she was on a starship. She fired adrenaline into her systems to finish waking before she padded silently down the corridor to the bridge. Her eyes darted everywhere as she listened to the conversation between Kara and approach control. What she heard was normal inbound procedure transmissions, but it only slightly lessened her fear.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You should be resting. We won’t be there for another hour." Valen sat silently continuing to watch Kara’s every move. "I see. You don’t trust me. I helped you escape and still you don’t trust me. Very well, I grant you safety upon my ship and in my presence. Is that better?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A look of annoyance passed over Kara’s face as she turned to look at Valen. After a moment she said, "Kis prelaten." Valen dropped into the spare chair and stared back at Kara. "So you know what that means then. Few gawakt do."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen nodded slowly. "I...I think so. At least the translated words for it. I would like to hear from you though, I don't trust the translation to be fully acurate." Her voice trailed off into silence as she stared at Kara.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara laughed, "You do match your reputation for smart. It doesn't really translate very well, however it is comradeship, sisterhood, and protection. It also means I will assist you any time you ask for help. I have guaranteed your safety in my presence."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's what I'd heard. Why? You don't know me." Kara’s words guaranteed her safety more completely than any legal document ever written. Further, it promised aid and assistance any time Valen called upon her. Valen tried once more to speak, but couldn’t get past a curious lump in her chest.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You have kulprash, spirit, courage, the word doesn’t translate well from Eritsani. There are few I know who can look a blaster in the face and not flinch."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen replied, "Death and I have danced before. One day we shall become better acquainted. I hope we remain friends at the end."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara laughed, "You speak like an Eritsani and you intrigue me, it is why I choose to befriend you now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I forgot to thank you earlier for fixing my shoulder."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No worries. I’ve arranged to have someone look at it here." Valen pulled back. "Wait, don’t worry, its with someone I trust not to ask questions."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Kara, I ... there are things about me ... there are medical things I can’t afford to have questioned. They identify me as...they raise questions that are better left forgotten."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Are you one of those genetic anomalies? No station doctor worth a damn cares about that. Blaster damage is nothing to play around with. Look, I’ll back you up if you refuse to answer anything, but I won’t let you remain here without medical attention. You asked for my help, well this is part of it. We should get you the Spacer Cocktail as well. It’ll protect you from catching anything station side."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think I’m covered. It looks bad if the Premiere collapses during a state dinner so the security group has their own version of it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After a few more moments Kara said, "Keep an eye on her, if anything seems wrong hit the all-call and yell for me. You can’t appear here as yourself. I think I can find an old flight suit and boots from Ettaleiya Andreskova, my cousin on my mother’s side.  You look almost exactly like her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What?" Valen asked, but Kara was already gone. ‘How can this be?’ she thought. ‘Another person I look like?’</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen remained lost in thought even after Kara returned a few minutes later. Kara’s voice finally broke through her reverie. "Valen, Valen...you’ve got to pay attention. I need to tell you a bit about Ettaleiya. First of all don’t speak you have been mute from birth. You know you look like the Butch - er - sorry, like Valen, and you are tired of being reminded. For now, we’ll use my CredID. Just follow along with my lead, if we have to do this again I’ll teach you some signing to make it more believable. We’ll get you a portable note unit once we get dockside, that’ll help. Now, put this on and join me when you’re ready." In her hand she was holding a tattered, faded flight suit with ‘E. Andreskova’ on the name tag. Silently Valen took the offered suit. She slipped back to her room for the few minutes it took to change.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara was completing docking procedures when Valen arrived back on the bridge. "We are docking at one of the older docking clusters. Customs inspection should be very brief since we aren’t carrying cargo right now. They’ll just place seals on the cargo bay and have us sign a customs declaration." There was a gentle thump and some far away clanking as the docking clamps settled into place as Kara finished speaking. A few minutes later there was another thump and clank as the access way attached.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Five minutes later the comm beeped and a voice said, "Ghost Wind, this is Teyis customs. Cargo locks are in place. You may proceed to customs and immigration at your convenience. Thank you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen followed Kara to the crew airlock and out. It was very different from the facilities she was used to as Premier. No local dignitaries were waiting to escort her to her first meetings. No security watched from the wings. The tube ended at a junction of several others where faded letters and arrows detailed the bay number and directions to the rest of the station. Everything was worn and faded, showing signs of age and hard use, not the clean newness of the areas she had become used to seeing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They emerged into the independent section of the docking facilities. Flight suits and garish garb from all sections of the Imperium swirled around them. Everywhere there were signs of hard times. Many of the support service rooms were closed up with fading notices attached to the doors. The clothing, while varied, was invariably worn and patched.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The shop where they found a simple note unit wasn’t much better than the rest of the docks. Many of the shelves were empty and there was only one person watching the automated purchase station.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara next steered her through the jumble and deeper into the station. "It hasn’t been the same since the corporates expanded. There just isn’t much work for us independents anymore, especially here in the Core Systems." After several twists and turns she came to another unremarkable door. "Here we are. He shouldn’t even ask anything, but if he does, just ignore it." She opened the door and pushed Valen into the room ahead of her. Inside was a tiny reception area with an empty desk across from the door. Deeper within the suite a bell rang sharply. A few minutes later an old man came out of the back, wiping his hands on a towel.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I called earlier. My cousin needs a burn checked and treated."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ah yes, right this way." He led the way back into a small examination room behind the desk and pointed at the table. "Show me." His eyes widened at the sight of it. "I can treat that, but it would be better handled at one of the burn units. I can’t guarantee it’ll heal with full range of motion and there will certainly be a lot of scarring. A burn unit would do a much better job." Valen shook her head. "Ok then. You stay here while I get some supplies." He looked at Kara and motioned her to follow him. Once they were out of the examination room he turned to Kara and said, "According to station policy I have to report any blaster burns to security." He paused expectantly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Would a hundred extra creds ease your memory?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Nicely. Now let’s fix her up, shall we? This is going to take a while and it might be best if she went someplace quiet when I’m done." They returned and he began working, explaining the procedure as he began, "First I’m going to numb the area and remove the last of the burned tissue, then I’m going to graft a section of artificial skin over it to help it heal. It will drain for several days and will need to be kept dry for the first two, after that you may shower." He worked quickly and carefully for a few moments, then stopped suddenly. "Young woman, what can you tell me about this injury? You have some strange fibrous material lodged in the edges of the wound. It doesn’t seem consistent with the burns you have suffered. I thought it was foriegn material but it seems to be woven into the tissue of your shoulder."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen lifted her note unit and typed, "It’s a hereditary condition, I don’t remember what it is called. It results in odd fibrous tendrils spreading through my skin."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With a suspicious look at Kara he went back to treating the wound, doing a good job for the tools he had.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It took him close to two hours to complete the procedure. As he was carefully placing Valen’s arm into a sling he gave final care instructions. "Try not to move this around very much for a while. The remaining muscle needs time to begin healing. If you stress it too much now, it’ll tear and cause you lots of trouble." He turned his attention briefly to Kara. "There’s a drainage tube at the bottom of the wound, I want you to make sure any drainage remains clear and fluid. If it begins to thicken or turn cloudy you will need to get her medical attention right away. Infection is always a possibility in any bad burn. I’ll give her some antibiotics, but it still needs to be watched. And it will need to be checked again later."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Then Kara hustled Valen back to Ghost Wind, on the way asking, "I’m going to go round up supplies. Is there anything you’d like? It’ll be a longer trip this time." Valen was about to say that she didn’t, until she noticed the blinking fuel cell indicator for her implant. It had been going almost steadily since she had arrived at Ghost Wind but she hadn’t really had time to deal with it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Quickly she typed onto her pad before turning it to Kara. It read, "How about some Andriesonian truffles? And a bottle of Icicle Everclear would be good..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Andriesonian truffles? Yeah, right...just because you look like Valen doesn’t mean you can afford to act like her. And Icicle Everclear? Why not just ask for rocket fuel instead. But if you really want it..." Valen nodded. "I’ll see if I can find some."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara found Valen in the galley when she returned a couple of hours later. She was carrying a small bag. "I actually found some of the Icicle stuff, it cost a fair amount though..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen pulled the icicle shaped bottle out of the bag and cracked the seal. She held it to her nose and inhaled deeply. The mint and curry aroma assured her it was the real thing. She moved to the lockers, pulled out a large drink holder, filled it half full, and took a healthy drink. Almost immediately the fuel cell indicator climbed into the green zone as the bio-filters diverted the alcohol to the fuel cell implant.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara looked on amazed. "How can you drink that stuff?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen stopped before taking a second big drink as she saw Kara staring. Instead she answered, "It’s made from the Icicle Frost Lichen. Long ago, long before I became Premier, I lived on Icicle for a time. Frost Lichen grows there and lots of things are made with it. If you get to like it you find you sometimes really crave it. I found this was the best off-Icicle source. Although, it did take a while to get used to the alcohol bite that comes with it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara shook her head once more and continued, "It’ll take a couple more hours to load the supplies, then I want to be out of here. There’s a large military convoy headed this way. Scouts have already arrived and no one is screaming for you or me either, so I think they haven’t been alerted yet. Still I don’t want to be here when the rest of them arrive. Next stop the fringe, and hopefully cargo." She turned as if to go, then turned back with a grin, "Oops, almost forgot..." She tossed a tiny dark green container at Valen whose reflexes snapped her arm out in a catch before she was really aware of the object. Kara was already out the door as she glanced down at the label.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You can’t afford these." Valen yelled after her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I can once I bill you for saving your ass." Kara shouted back.</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">Once Ghost Wind had disconnected from the station and was on her way out Kara announced their next destination would be the Terristra System. "It should be quiet enough for you to disappear, yet offer me an opportunity for cargo. I have to warn you it’ll take us about five standard days to get there."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Two hours after departure they were once again in hyperspace, settling down for the five day wait. They talked a bit to pass the time, especially the first day out, but mostly Valen took to trying not to. Somehow Kara’s friendliness made her feel more and more obligated to her. There were the costs of the trip, but that was the least of it. What was far worse was her continual kindness. Valen couldn’t get a sense of what she wanted from her. What ever it was she figured it’d be big.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her security chief’s betrayal ate at her. She couldn’t get past the fact she’d never even suspected it. She examined the data she’d downloaded again and again, looking for clues she should have seen. Without the server logs and the security chief's files nothing really looked out of place. Over and over she berated herself for not recognizing the risks.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Then there was that cryptic remark about one mind, she still had no idea what he’d meant by that, just that it struck terror deep inside her. She was also troubled by what Kara was telling her. As they talked Valen began to realize she hadn’t had much control after all. At first she tried to defend her policies and procedures on various worlds, only to slowly realize many of her directives had been misinterpreted or ignored entirely. The regional governors had taken it on themselves to not ‘bother’ her with the ‘trivialities’ of their domains. Trivialities like torture, death camps, public executions, and innumerable other brutalities, all of which were laid at her feet.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Frustrated she got up and began pacing around the galley. "Damn it, those are just the actions I was trying to stop. I thought I was managing to keep it under control. Instead it was just business as usual."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think you managed to slow it down, at least in the Core Sectors."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But I wanted to stop it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There was one of you and so many of them. It’s amazing you managed to get the things done that you did. Give yourself a break."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen continued to pace around the room as she thought over Kara’s comments. "Yeah, maybe you are right about it." Still, it gave her little comfort.</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">Sleep wouldn’t come to Valen that night. Things kept playing themselves over and over in her mind. After two hours of staring at the ceiling she dressed and quietly prowled the corridors near her cabin. Most of the doors opened onto empty rooms, no bigger than hers but with no furnishings at all. The fifth door she tried opened into a well equipped workout room. Her shoulder kept her away from the upper body things so instead she climbed onto the treadmill and began walking and running for all she was worth. Every time she felt winded and slowed down another burst of energy would surge up from somewhere and get her moving again. She worked until sweat poured off her and her muscles shook with fatigue.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As she was resting on the deck, waiting for her muscles to recover, a dark shape leapt from the doorway and thudded onto her chest. A shriek of pain and terror ripped across the room as the blur streaked back out the door. Fear pushed her upright as she clung to the treadmill. She was still shaking with reaction when Kara appeared in the door with a large grey bundle in her arms. "I see you’ve finally met Mr. Jones. I’m sorry I forgot to mention him. He usually stays to himself when the gravity is turned on. He’s not very friendly toward strangers."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What, who?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mr. Jones, ship’s cat, please meet Premier Valen, lately ruler of the galaxy and now fugitive..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why didn’t you tell me?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara looked embarrassed as she explained, "I, uh...forgot about him." Jones turned and gave her what could only be described as a long suffering look while she continued, "I tend to once in a while until he reminds me to fill his food containers. He came with the ship and it can take a long time for him to come out and investigate visitors."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Pleased to meet you Jonesie..." His ears went back and his face twisted into a cat look of disgust. "He's very formal. He only likes Mr. Jones, or, if he really likes you, you can get by with just Jones."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Excuse me, Mr. Jones." Valen apologized feeling rather foolish, but watching his ears come up.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now, why didn’t you ask me how to use this stuff? I’d have been happy to show you how not to hurt yourself. No, don’t try and get up! Put your head down and breath slowly. Wait until all the dizziness has passed."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’m not dizzy, it’s just muscle fatigue." Kara reached out and steadied Valen. She slowly slid down until she was seated on the deck as the adrenaline burst faded from her exhausted muscles. At the touch of Kara’s hands Valen flinched and almost snapped at her. Another muscle twitch almost dumped her sideways onto the floor and she clamped down on the angry words, letting Kara hold her shoulders so she wouldn’t fall.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I couldn’t sleep, but I didn’t want to wake you. I didn’t even know this was here. I was just out prowling around. I hope that was ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, it’s ok, nothing here that’s top security or anything. Don’t worry about it. Have you used this stuff before?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"For a while I worked out until the duties of premiere became too much. I remember my way around though."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It still wouldn’t have been a problem to wake me up. I don’t keep a very regular schedule anyway. What’s the point when the only time it matters is when you get to a port?" She helped Valen get back to her room and left as Valen fell onto her bunk. This time sleep came quickly.</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">The next morning Valen awoke wondering at something she’d heard Kara say the night before. She tracked her down in the galley and asked, "What did you mean when you said Mr. Jones usually keeps to himself when the gravity is on?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just that I usually turn the gravity generators off during actual voyages. It saves a lot of energy and I find I really like living weightless. Although I’ll usually turn it on for a little while each day and then work out. It helps keep muscle mass for when I’m on a planet or station."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Don’t let me stop you. I’m not good in no grav, but I do enjoy it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, I’ll shut the gravity off once we’ve finished this coffee."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’d like to try it." They sat in almost companionable silence for a while, each lost in their own thoughts and sipping fresh coffee.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, before I shut down the grav systems, why don’t we figure out a workout plan for you, at least the lower body stuff?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, that’d be great, thanks." Kara guided Valen back to the gym and set about creating a thorough workout that would work most of her muscles without completely exhausting her. When they were done they went back to the control area and Kara shut down the gravity generators. Unlike a lot of people she reduced the gravity before finally turning it off, explaining that this way she adapted better. As Valen tried to follow her back to the galley she began to understand how to use the pads that were attached to the walls at various points. Kara would push off from one then use another to redirect her drift. Valen tried to copy her moves and ended up bouncing her way from wall to wall. Kara was already strapped to one of the galley chairs when Valen flailed in through the door. Moments later a grey streak flew into the room and came to rest near the food storage. Mr. Jones carefully drifted to Kara and delicately hooked himself to her jumpsuit. Almost immediately he began purring loudly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once they’d gotten used to the feeling of no gravity Kara gave Valen a full tour of the ship as a way to get used to moving weightless. Ghost Wind was an old ship. Everywhere there were signs of refitting and then refitting on top of earlier refittings. By the time they were finished Valen wasn’t sure if anything was left of the original ship, except maybe the hull and the overall structural design. She was a DSC Stock Light-duty Freighter, and one of the older ones at that. If the nameplate was to be believed she was one of the prototypes for their earliest commercial star ship.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The main living section was large enough to support a crew of 12 to 18 people. At one time it had been very common for a family to buy a ship and then live on it. Quite a few of the older spacer families had grown in these family ships. It looked as if Ghost Wind had been fitted out that way at one time. Most of the cabins had been closed off and stripped. Now they were just empty space doubling as extra storage if it was needed. Kara had outfitted a couple as spare cabins, but it was obvious they weren’t used any more often than the cabin she had given to Valen. With the commercial haulers absorbing more and more of the independents, family ships had become less common.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The engineering and cargo sections were fairly simple. The rest of the ship consisted of the corridors necessary to link cargo areas and engineering to the crew areas. There were a few smaller access ways that led to various critical sections of electronics and hyperdrive systems.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The bridge showed the most extensive refitting. Ghost Wind had originally been designed for at least a two-person crew, with an engineering station for a third. Someone had completely rewired it so that everything was available at a newer console at the left position. A lot of the old instrumentation was still connected and could be used if there was a larger crew.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen spent the rest of the day moving around to become used to weightlessness. She improved quickly as the cyberware tuned itself to the types of motions that worked best. That evening the nightmares came again, but couldn’t quite defeat her exhaustion.</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">The next morning Kara drifted into the galley excitedly showing a handful of pictures. "Now I know why you seem familiar! Look at these!" She handed them to Valen who took them with suddenly numb fingers. The first picture in the stack was of her and Amanda laughing and hugging, looking like they hadn’t a care in the world. The next one was of their first apartment, another was their graduation, several more were from their years at the Space Fleet Intelligence Training Center.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In a very quiet voice she asked, "Where did you get these?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Amanda gave them to me a while ago. We had been talking about you. I was thinking you weren’t as bad as your reputation, she was telling me you were worse. She told me she had seen your conversion from a person to the reputation. As I was leaving she said I would appreciate these more than she could." She saw Valen twitch and continued, "I’m sorry. I tried to convince her your policies showed you weren’t the monster she thought you’d become, but she didn’t want to hear it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She’s alive..." she couldn’t imagine it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That surprises you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I last saw her on Seconus 4, just before the riots. We were part of the diplomatic group and our mission was to infiltrate and either defuse or destroy the rebels. I last saw her when I warned the rank and file to disappear before the arrests. The leaders started the riots and I lost track of her when the troops arrived. I’m glad she escaped. I wish it had been different between us there at the end. She couldn’t understand my decisions."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She was alive a couple of years ago, I haven’t been out her way in a long time. I imagine she still is..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Did, did she say anything else?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Like what?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Anything else about me..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She said...are you sure you want me to answer that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Please, go on..." She had to know.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just that she never did understand you. She couldn’t figure if the coldness was a defense, or if the sparks of humanity were an act. She never did understand how you could turn the soldiers on the rioters, knowing what their lives were like."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Was there anything else?" Even now talking about her hurt, but Valen couldn’t stop asking.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. Just that she loved you and wished the woman you’d been hadn’t been killed by the monster you became. She wished you could have found peace."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Peace?!? In a place where every slick tongued piece of trash rose to power and screwed those under them? Where a woman couldn’t be safe anywhere she went?" She stopped abruptly as she realized she was screaming the same arguments she had hurled at Amanda not long before the riots erupted. "I’m sorry, it’s an old argument that I haven’t really forgotten..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After a long silence Kara’s comment of, "So you really did do it. I was never sure." pulled Valen out of her anger and self-recriminations.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In a quiet, distant kind of voice Valen answered slowly, "Yes, yes I did." The story came out slowly, as if another force was compelling her to speak. "We had gone to school together, Amanda and I. We had become very close and I bullied my way along on her first assignment. Amanda was always more idealistic than I, so when she saw the plight of the rebels on Seconus 4 she was quickly sucked in. In time so was I. Their cause was a just one and the conditions they were forced to live under were intolerable. We were trying to work out a way to help get the rebels what they wanted when I was given access to their detailed plans. They were going to stage riots and terrorist attacks on several major cities and facilities. I don’t know if you know anything about the Seconus System, but it has an inner planet, Seconus 4, and an outer one, Seconus 5. S5 is cool to cold, with plenty of water and plentiful resources. Each settlement can support itself. S4 on the other hand is a very hot world. Most of it is near desert with very few places where water is plentiful. Every settlement is linked together through a common power, communication, and water facility. Destruction of that facility would easily kill most of the population. S4 is also a client world of S5 and a mining site. The citizens of S4 wanted to strike back at the affluent citizens of S5 who were exploiting them rather badly. Most of whom lived in the main city, Yarkatajra. Their plan was to destroy the communications and water facility there, unfortunately it is also the main facility. I warned as many of the lower level people as I safely could, then called in the security forces."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Didn’t you clean up that mess after taking office?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I did, but I wish I could have done so before it cost so many lives." Valen lapsed into silence, remembering afresh the brutality of that time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's why I was never sure. You never seemed the Special Ops type. I thought it was part of your persona, a mystique to give credence to how you came to power."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why, because I seemed to care?" Valen asked, her mouth twisted in a grimace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Exactly. I've met a couple of Special Ops and they were the scariest people I've seen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You didn't know me then. Caring was a problem, though, and the reason I left Special Ops."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You can leave?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Officially, sure. In reality, it takes a lot of leverage and determniation. The training has served me, though not as well as I had hoped."</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the time to Terristra System was spent in strained silence. It was so near the edge of the Alliance that most of it’s light fell outside Alliance borders. Kara began approach procedures while Valen watched silently from the hatchway. "Terristra Approach, this is Ghost Wind requesting docking and approach information."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ghost Wind, Terristra Approach, please hold for approach vector and docking assignment, you are number 78 in the queue. Estimated docking time 72 hours from now. Please advise if you need emergency services before then."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Terristra Approach, Ghost Wind, we are not declaring an emergency at this time." She turned away from the comm with a very puzzled look. "This is one of the most out of the way places I know of. I wonder why all the traffic?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Is there any way we could ask around?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We could try a general broadcast to arrivals on another channel..." With that she was back at the comm panel tapping new instructions into the system. "This is a general query from Ghost Wind, does anyone know the reason for all the inbound traffic? Please respond on transponder 87, thank you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later a slow voice with the accent of the Core Systems answered, "Ghost Wind, this is Terrel’s Profit. We left the Core Systems 12 days ago, nothing was happening then. We don’t know either."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ghost Wind, this is Megan’s Far Traveler, we jumped from Centralys after reports of a government shake-up. Reports were extremely vague and ranged from the assassination of Premier Valen, to an outright coup. We didn’t feel like staying and getting tangled up in it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ghost Wind, this is Alliance Starship Foundation, we received word that Premier Valen is wanted on charges of treason. She is alleged to have attempted to free the Razaks from their containment. A provisional government has been established until a final replacement structure can be put in place. Valen needs to be found and tried. She is also wanted in connection with the murders of her Chief of Staff, Director of Intelligence, the Vice Commander of Alliance Forces, and Vice President Santrosk."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen sat abruptly as ice filled her veins. “Razaks!” Her mind screamed. Finally she remembered why one mind had seemed familiar. It was actually OneMind, the Razak Unity’s governing principle. Someone had freed them and she was being blamed. It took only moments to make the connections. The security chief taking extended trips to the edge of the containment zone, ostensibly to check security. The security chief digging through the closed files for information on the containment systems and procedures, again claiming security concerns. He had released them on the unsuspecting galaxy.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She was trying to figure what to do next when she remembered the Karanal Experimental Facilities. She waved frantically to Kara until she cut the link with the others. "Now what? I’m still trying to figure out what’s going on."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How are we for supplies? What is our current range?" Fear made her voice sharp.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We have sufficient range for a jump to the far side of the Core Systems, why?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good. I need to get to the Karanal system immediately. I need to warn them. I’ve got to get there before the Razaks find out about it, if I don’t no one will be able to run far enough."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hold it! I’m not a charity. I can’t afford to keep running around the universe without payment of some kind. I barely have enough reserve to buy supplies here, let alone anywhere further out."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Please, just trust me for a little while longer. If we can warn them there’ll be plenty in it for you. We can load up and there should be cargo you can haul, although with the Razaks taking over I don’t know how long the banking systems will survive. If we don’t get to them, then it just won’t matter anyway. Look, I’d go by myself if I could, but I can’t. Please help me do this then you can leave me somewhere and be done with me. Please, just this last favor?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara’s eyes hardened for a brief moment as Valen specifically asked her for help. "I will help you because I honor my oath, not because you are offering me money. But, are you sure you aren’t chasing the bogeyman?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The sting of Kara’s words penetrated Valen’s defenses more than they should have. Stung, she replied, "I thought they were bogeymen too, until I saw the budget for the containment forces. Then I started digging, not believing it was anything more than an elaborate scheme to siphon funds. What I found in the sealed records convinced me it was real and more terrifying than any of the surviving legends. They exist. They destroy anything that is not like them. They view us as little more than a food resource, if they value us that much. The only time they will appear to cooperate with others is when they are too weak to destroy them outright. Then they attack from within until they are strong enough to exterminate their allies." She paused for a moment before continuing in a quieter tone, "I apologize. I did not mean to insult you. It is my desire to fairly compensate you for your trouble. I realize I have caused you a great deal of it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">‘Who’d have thought she could apologize,’ Kara thought to herself before she replied with, "I ... I accept your apology. Thank you"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Terristra Approach, this is Ghost Wind, please cancel our approach request and route us out-system. We will be dropping other cargo and then returning. Please reassign our approach position and good luck with the traffic."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ghost Wind, this is Terristra Approach, you are clear for rerouting. I’m transmitting your out-system routing now. May your profits be high."</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">Kara’s nav terminal was out of date, but it had almost enough references to get them close to the Karanal system. After that they could take additional readings to get the last jump. "Valen, just where is this place we’re going and why is it so important?" She ignored Kara’s questions as she worked out the quickest routing and entered it into the nav system. Finally Kara’s anger boiled over as she snarled, "Look, you asked for my help. I can’t give you any if I don’t know what’s going on."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen finished and turned to her. "Karanal is a top secret Alliance research station. I can’t tell you exactly what they are working on because I don’t really know either, but they do all the high level weapons research for the Space Fleet. They are also the ones who devised an efficient and safe source of antimatter, which allowed hyperdrive engines to jump farther and faster than they could on the old fusion power plants. And they are experimenting with dimensional physics, the basis of hyperdrive engine theory, and much more. If the Razaks could get hold of their research they would immediately have the weapons they need to wipe us out." Kara’s only response was to turn pale and begin threading them back out of the Terristra System. Two hours later they were in hyperspace again.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The first couple of days they got along well, but as the time dragged on Valen began to get more and more withdrawn. She tried to read, she tried to watch vids, she tried everything to distract herself and none of it worked. Vague images stalked her dreams. The security chief captured her and tortured her in numerous ways, and under it all a shadowy cold lurked. Days were not much easier. Over and over she tried to think, to plan any kind of response to the Razak threat. If only she could come up with a way to give warning. After four days it was too much for Kara. She cornered Valen in the galley and started probing. "There’s something eating at you. Would you like to talk about it?" Valen sat stonily and continued eating her food. "Soon we’ll be at Karanal and then we’ll part ways. You’ll never see me again. It’s not like telling someone you know, besides, I wouldn’t dare say anything. If I did, I’d have to explain how I knew you and where I last saw you." Still Valen said nothing. "Look, I really don’t care if you want to eat yourself alive, but it’s really tedious to watch you do it. Why not at least wait until we’ve parted and I don’t have to see it happening?" Kara paused again and waited until she was sure Valen wasn’t going to answer. "OK, fine, I’ll leave you alone, but if you change your mind, you know where to find me. For the next few days anyway..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The next day Kara started ignoring Valen in return. After two days Valen drifted into the galley while Kara was sipping coffee. She retrieved some for herself and moved to the table. Valen sat staring into her coffee, she didn’t want to ruin the moment by talking, but she felt she needed to try, if only to sleep better that night. She reached into a pocket and fished out the small jar Kara had tossed her at Teyis. Quietly she cracked the seal and passed it to Kara, offering her the first truffle. "I guess I do kind of want to talk. I need you to know that I’m not good at this, at all... I don’t know where to begin. Trust doesn’t come easily to me. I’m wondering how could this have happened? I watched everyone under me, I looked for any sign they might be planning something and still I missed it. They had proved themselves countless times and I had come to trust them. How could I have been so blind? How could the Razaks have been contacted? There were reporting procedures and checks, security protocols and such. There should have been no way for anyone to slip through. Then there’s the whole chain of events with the regional governors. Why did they ignore my wishes? Why did they torture and kill? I never told them to do that. How did it all fall apart so easily? I thought I was watching for symptoms of corruption and power madness. I wanted to make things better, to give power back to the normal people."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How did you climb to power? I’m betting you slipped through cracks, exploited weak areas and kept a low profile. You were busy making changes and being Premiere, how could you have watched enough? How many plots were you able to discover? I am betting quite a few to last as long as you did."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But I didn’t catch this one. Now they’ve released destruction on the galaxy because of it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Even if these Razaks are as bad as you say they are..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"They are!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Even so, you can’t take the blame for this. If they are as bad as you say, they would have gotten loose eventually anyway. Would we have been any more prepared for them later? You said they were largely forgotten about. Think about it, might not the forces guarding them have gotten sloppy? You can take the blame if you must, but maybe you should think about it first."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I need to do something. I need to warn people. There are so many things we should be doing to try and prepare for this, yet I don’t even know where to start."</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">After ten very long days they emerged and could calculate their final jump. In another day they were at the fringe of the Karanal system and headed in. As they arrived at the outer marker they were immediately bombarded by an automatic warning system, "Attention you are in restricted military space. Identify immediately or be destroyed."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Quickly Valen keyed her codes and overrides. Just as she reached to send it, Kara slapped her hand away, "Think! Remember what you said about your ID card?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"DAMN! Your right...but if we don’t send something the automated defenses Elentaryn has constructed will blow us out of existence."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Did you say Elentaryn? That wouldn’t be Elentaryn Vardos would it? Maybe I can do something, I knew him for a while." She made some adjustments to the comm settings and then began transmitting, "Military installation, this is Kalimayani Karakinska of the Ghost Wind. I have an urgent message for Elentaryn Vardos from his father, Atrayas Vardos." Valen turned and really looked at her. There had to be a mistake. The heiress to Drakon Pharmaceuticals wouldn’t be out running a tramp freighter, would she? Yet now that she looked at Kara she could be an older version of the heiress. She looked at her, ready to ask, when the comm broke in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ghost Wind, please transmit ship registry, identification, cargo and passenger manifests immediately. We will be bringing you in under automatic approach. Refusal or deviation from automatic control will be considered a hostile gesture and will result in your immediate destruction. Transmit verbal acceptance of these instructions and begin downloading of requested documents. Automatic approach control will begin at the conclusion of transmission."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Quickly Kara’s hands danced over the panel as she stared at Valen. "You will be Ettaleiya again." The she turned back to the comm, "Military control, I have received and understood your instructions. Automatic interfacing is now enabled. Manifests are being transmitted. You may proceed at your convenience."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Acknowledged Ghost Wind. No further voice transmissions will be expected, or tolerated, until docking is complete. I must inform you, this is a military installation. You will be met at the dock by an armed escort, please cooperate fully. Any non - approach transmissions are prohibited from now on."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Friendly bunch, aren’t they?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen just nodded, there wasn’t much else to say. While they were on approach Kara gave her a more detailed sketch of the person she was supposed to be. She also included the background circumstances that kept her mute. Kara was scared, but also excited. Her actions were more animated and vibrant than they had been before. Valen handed over her identicard after donning Ettaleiya’s suit once more, realizing again just how comfortable it really was. "Kara, we need to dispose of this. If they find it, we will be in really big trouble. Besides I don’t think I dare use it again. Of course it means we don’t have a card for me..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It’ll be a problem, but we will be in enough trouble already that it probably won’t count for much more." She took Valen’s card and headed to the galley, where she put it in her coffee grinder, then into a hot pot until it had been rendered into a puddle of melted plastic and ground circuitry. If someone had reason to be extremely suspicious, they might have been able to get something out of it in a good forensics lab. Their job was going to be to keep them from getting that suspicious.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The trip in was short. Kara kept pounding dates, facts and names into Valen’s head. She wanted her to absorb the entire history of her cousin in 6 hours. As they were in the final phase of docking she finally stopped. "If you don’t have it by now, it just won’t matter." She reached and sounded the depressurization alarm for a moment. An instant later a grey streak zipped by and into a small hatchway under the bridge engineering station. There was the hiss of a closing pressure seal and a green light illuminated on the main panel. "Can’t forget Jones!" she answered as she reached under the console and unhooked a small pressurized pet carrier.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They were directed to dock in the maximum-security bay. A closer look showed every weapon in the place trained on their ship. A single soldier was waiting as they cycled the lock. "I’m afraid you’ll need to proceed one at a time through the decontamination lock. As soon as you are clear we will be dispatching a scanning crew to sweep your ship. If there are any other life forms aboard, all of you will be spaced at once. On behalf of Commander Torzelth I would like to apologize for this rude behavior. Once you have been cleared everything will be explained." He waved them toward the lock, never once taking the gun off them, and never getting closer than ten feet.  When he saw Mr. Jones’ carrier he froze, then in a small voice he asked, "What’s in the carrier?" As he finished speaking Valen could see the sweat rolling off him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara looked him up and down like he was some bizarre type of insect and frostily replied, "My cat, Mr. Jones. He was listed in the manifest," then walked stiffly to the lock.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They spent an hour in the lock chamber waiting. Someone had at least thought to provide chairs. Once more Valen thought of asking her about her relation to Drakon Pharmaceuticals, but decided against it, figuring the lock would be under surveillance.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After the hour had crawled by, the inner hatch swung open to reveal Commander Torzelth himself. For a brief moment Valen froze, afraid he’d recognize her immediately. Part of her wished he would so she could unburden herself to him and get his help. Instead she kept quiet, not sure what sort of forces might already be working on him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Forgive me Ms. Karakinska, Ms. Andreskova. We are under maximum alert conditions at this time, thus our hospitality is rather strained." Once he had seen Valen he couldn’t take his eyes away. "I’m sorry Ms. Andreskova, your cousin’s manifest warned us about the resemblance you bear to the Premier, it’s just more perfect than I could have imagined." So saying he motioned them through the lock. He had aged since she had last seen him. It made her regret not having traveled to Karanal more times than she had. He was still the friendly bear of a man that she remembered. Even the maximum alert hadn’t completely removed the twinkle of humor from his eyes. "I’d take you to where you could meet Elentaryn right away, but he is conducting some important tests right now. He should be done in an hour or two and then we can proceed from here. You can bring your cat, he should be all right in my office."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They spent the next hour in pleasant conversation. At least he and Kara did. Valen was trying very hard not to speak, and not to look like she knew too much about his office. It was mostly the same as the last time she was there. There was another picture of his wife on the desk and a new picture of his daughter in Space Fleet blues on the wall. His staff still made some of the best tea. Mr. Jones prowled around for a while, sniffing at everything before popping up into the commander’s lap and curling up, purring in his most fetching manner.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Prepare station for shield tests. All crew to duty stations."  Blared from the comm speakers on his desk, followed by a short countdown. Startled out of his relaxed state by the comm, Jones jumped to the deck and glared up at the commander. He arrived on Valen’s lap just as the countdown reached zero. The room shimmered briefly, almost like it was viewed through an expanding soap bubble, then returned to normal. Jones flinched, digging claws into her leg for the moments while the shimmer lasted, then relaxing as it passed by. For an instant pain flared through Valen’s head also. It was gone almost as quickly as it had begun, leaving her looking about curiously, wondering what it was she’d seen. She just caught the disappointment on Commander Torzelth’s face as he said, "I had hoped we’d at least see something..." Kara looked equally unmoved.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"All personnel, shield testing is complete. You may resume normal duties."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Moments later the commander’s comm buzzed. He didn’t mute it, so they all heard, "Commander, this is Elentaryn, I’m afraid it didn’t work. We will need to recalculate and rework some of our equipment. Hopefully we can try again in seven to ten days." It took all Valen’s self-control not to leap up and scream at him that he wouldn’t have ten days.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As Commander Torzelth signed off, Kara began, "Commander, I think I should tell you what Elentaryn’s father wanted me to tell him. His father has heard rumors of a Razak invasion of Centralys. He believes that where ever Elentaryn is might be in grave danger."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You know, that brings up a really good question. How DID you two find this place? I know for a fact it’s not in any but the most secure nav computers. Who else knows where we are? Is this really your cousin or Valen herself? Valen would know how to get here and it's a really interesting coincidence that you two show up right now. I’ve known that viper Valen longer than anyone and I’d swear I was looking right at her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen tried desperately to not respond but she couldn’t quite keep a brief twitch of a grin off her face. Giving up she replied, "Sharp as ever Tom, but really, viper?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It provoked a response, didn’t it?" He commented with a huge grin. "Now, why the deception? You could have just come right in."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Kara, meet my oldest, closest friend and rogue about the galaxy, Tom Torzelth. I knew I made the right decision letting you settle in here. As to the deception, what have you heard from Centralys recently? Last I heard I was being hunted as a traitor. I was hoping to avoid being detained."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well there have been all manner of messages, although the largest number are requests to immediately capture you and return you to Centralys for trial. Seems the entire place is in some sort of uproar. What did you do this time?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Am I under arrest then?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No. I would like to know what your side is though..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I didn’t release the Razaks, my security chief did. Right now they will be sifting through all the databases and systems looking for places like this to neutralize. He will then use the help of the Razaks to come and eliminate these threats as quickly as he can get ships in position. Elentaryn won’t have ten days to get his shields working. He’ll be lucky to have any time at all before they are on their way here. We need to be gone, right now, as soon as possible. What can’t be taken needs to be destroyed."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Who said anything about Razaks? There’s been no word of containment breaches, no military alerts, and no mention from the new regime. The only things I have heard about are inspection teams being sent to evaluate various facilities. We’re scheduled to receive one sometime soon. It will determine if this facility will be maintained as a military research installation, converted to civilian R & D, or scrapped entirely. The story from the People’s Galaxy Leadership, the new governing group, is that the Razak invasion was actually the arrival of an envoy from the Zakra Peace Accord, an isolated sect of peace worshippers. Overly paranoid military personnel mistook their rather antiquated ship for a Razak warship. The word is you went mad when the first reports came in and began a bloodbath, eliminating many of your aids and large numbers of people in and around the government complex. You then escaped in a renegade ship. You are to be captured and returned to stand trial for those deaths. All Space Fleet facilities have been directed to issue immediate recalls of all their personnel. Most of us figure it’s another massive purge. I have to tell you there are quite a few of the research personnel who hope this place will be shut down and they will be allowed to go home."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I didn’t kill those people Tom."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I believe you. You usually don’t kill anyone who doesn’t desperately need it. Problem is your reputation has everyone convinced you did. The alternative, that there was something else going on, is too horrible for most people to want to hear."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"All I know about the situation is what little I was able to observe. The security people I was with were acting strangely. They were watchful, but their eyes seemed vacant, empty, like they were staring past you. My security chief spoke directly of OneMind as he was trying to talk me into surrender. Most everyone in the administrative center was behaving in ways consistent with the old records of Razak influence. One of the reasons I was able to slip out was there didn’t seem to be any independent action by the security details." It hit her then and she continued, "My security chief was always talking about his visits to the Zakra Peace Accord but I’d never even heard of them until he began his trips to the containment area. How could any group exist in that sector without someone having stumbled over them before now? Besides, look at it for a moment, if you rearrange Zakra, Razak falls right out. I know, that sounds pretty thin. But everyone involved in the admin center looked like they’d been drugged. I wish I had more I could tell you but I was in a hurry to leave. Other than the orders to pull back to home bases have there been any other military orders? Why are you on full alert here if there is no indication of trouble?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I didn’t say there was no trouble, just that it wasn’t from Centralys. We’ve had a large outbreak of Parasites. It’s almost like someone has deliberately gone in and removed larvae and spread them around. Telleris has a major outbreak and has been quarantined, Fertearn's World has several cases around the spaceport, and there are several ships that have left both those worlds that haven’t answered any transmissions. One of them was headed this way. As a precaution we are scanning everyone arriving. None of us want to deal with Parasites."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen shuddered, remembering reports of whole colonies destroyed by them. Somehow they invaded their hosts and took control of them. Xenobiologists still weren’t entirely sure what the mechanism really was. They did know that transmission required exposure to infected blood from an existing host or direct contact with a Parasite larva. Containment required total destruction of host tissues and blood. For a brief moment she flashed back to her nightmares. The image that had been just out of sight suddenly leapt into her mind. A suited figure was rolling her over and lowering a Parasite larva toward her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara was looking restless as she broke in with, "Well, it seems that Premier Valen is safe now. I think Mr. Jones and I should be getting on our way. Commander, Premier, if there is some way you could arrange for my ship to be re-supplied I’d be willing to consider us even."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Premier Valen isn’t safe here. There are a great many people who would like nothing more than to turn her over for the reward. Besides, there are certain to be residual effects from Elentaryn’s experiments, I’d recommend you wait a while before leaving." Commander Torzelth was about to continue when the comm beeped for attention again. "Sir, there is a Priority One transmission from a People’s Galaxy Leadership vessel. Also, perimeter scanning reports a large number of ships approaching our system. They are employing Level 6 masking and are in standard combat configuration."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen started to rise, expecting him to motion them out. Instead he motioned her to sit back down, then with a conspiratorial wink he replied, "Go ahead and link it through. Shut off the perimeter alerts, I don’t want them to know we know they are there." As he switched the comm, he added, "This seems just too coincidental."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Commander Torzelth, my name is Erislan. I am the special envoy of Jereth, the Voice of the People. I bring you greetings and salutations from the People. I have with me a small grouping of support ships and personnel to help us assess the situation at your facility. I ask that you assist us in any way you can. We should be arriving in three standard days. I look forward to our meeting." With that he signed off.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Valen, thoughts?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I expect he really is a while out, the other ships are here to discourage everyone from leaving until he arrives. I think that is the situation regardless of whether there are Razaks involved or not. I still believe there are. I also believe that no one will be allowed to leave here alive."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Looks like it’s time we involved the senior facility staff, although I think you had best not show yourself, Valen. I’ll get Elentaryn up here and we’ll talk some of this through, then go from there. I’d like both of you to be at that meeting." He rerouted his comm and spoke, "Elentaryn?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, commander?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There is a situation forming that I need your opinions about. Would you be free to meet with me in half an hour?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think I can make that. Your office?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That would be fine."</p>
