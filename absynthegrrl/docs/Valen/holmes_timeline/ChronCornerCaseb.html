<p> THE WORLD&#8217;S MOST PERFECT DATE STATEMENT:<br>
  "On the upper floor of the Northumberland Avenue establishment there is 
  an isolated corner where two couches lie side by side, and it was on these that 
  we lay upon September 3, 1902, the day when my narrative begins."</p>
<p>THE PLACE OF WATSON&#8217;S RESIDENCE:<br>
  "I was living in my own rooms in Queen Anne Street at the time . . ."</p>
<p>THE STATE OF WATSON&#8217;S CAREER:<br>
  "I had some pressing professional business of my own, but I met him by 
  appointment that evening at Simpson&#8217;s, where, sitting at a small table 
  in the front window and looking down at the rushing stream of life in the Strand."</p>
<p>AND A SECOND MENTION OF SIMPSON&#8217;S:<br>
  "I did not see Holmes again until the following evening when we dined once 
  more at our Strand restaurant."</p>
<p>THAT "KENNEDY ASSASSINATION" MOMENT:<br>
  "I think I could show you the very paving-stone upon which I stood when 
  my eyes fell upon the placard, and a pang of horror passed through my very soul. 
  It was between the Grand Hotel and Charing Cross Station, where a one-legged 
  news-vender displayed his evening papers. The date was just two days after the 
  last conversation."</p>
<p>TIME OF HOLMES&#8217;S INVALIDITY:<br>
  "For six days the public were under the impression that Holmes was at the 
  door of death."<br>
  "On the seventh day the stitches were taken out, in spite of which there 
  was a report of erysipelas in the evening papers. The same evening papers had 
  an announcement which I was bound, sick or well, to carry to my friend. It was 
  simply that among the passengers on the Cunard boat Ruritania, starting from 
  Liverpool on Friday, was the Baron Adelbert Gruner . . . ." <br>
  "Friday! Only three clear days."</p>
<p>THE TIME UNTIL FINAL RESOLUTION:<br>
  "Three days later appeared a paragraph in the Morning Post to say that 
  the marriage between Baron Adelbert Gruner and Miss Violet de Merville would 
  not take place."</p>

<p>THE BIRLSTONE RAILWAY TIMETABLE:<br>
  When Watson says "September 3, 1902" at the beginning of a case, I 
  have to go with Wednesday, September 3, 1902. As always, the good Zeisler wants 
  to contradict Watson&#8217;s best fact based on a more trivial fact, counting 
  off the days from the case&#8217;s beginning and deciding what beginning date 
  fits the "Friday" reference. Too many details lie in figuring that 
  day count, and all takes is one of them to be off to make the Zeisler thesis 
  wrong. Better to go with Watson&#8217;s solid date, don&#8217;t you think?</p>

  "I find from my notebook that it was in January, 1903, just after the conclusion 
  of the Boer War ... The good Watson had at that time deserted me for a wife, 
  the only selfish action which I can recall in our association. I was alone."</p>

  "That was what took me down on Monday."</p>
<p>DELAY OF GAME AND OTHER CASES:<br>
  "It happened that at the moment I was clearing up the case which my friend 
  Watson has described as that of the Abbey School, in which the Duke of Greyminster 
  was so deeply involved. I had also a commission from the Sultan of Turkey which 
  called for immediate action, as political consequences of the gravest kind might 
  arise from its neglect. Therefore it was not until the beginning of the next 
  week, as my diary records, that I was able to start forth on my mission . .

<p>WHAT THE BARING-GOULD ANNOTATED SAYS:<br>
  January 7, 1903. </p>
<p>WHAT ZEISLER, THE KING OF CHRONOLOGY, SAYS:<br>
  January 7, 1903.</p>
<p>THE BIRLSTONE RAILWAY TIMETABLE:<br>
  January 1903, the month and year of this case, come from our most unimpeachable 
  source &#8212; Holmes himself &#8212; and are backed up by the historical details 
  of the Boer War and its end in May of 1902. The day it begins is easily determined 
  by adding Dodd&#8217;s two nights at Tuxbury Old Place to his arrival there on 
  a Monday: thus Holmes begins the case on a Wednesday. But which Wednesday in 
  January of 1903?<br>
  Other chronologists have gone for the first Wednesday of that month, Zeisler 
  doing his usual detailed lunar calculations based on a comment from Dodd about 
  a half-moon. The thing I find hard to accept about an early January date for 
  this case, however, is Holmes&#8217;s involvement in the Abbey School case. As 
  the spring term of the Abbey School may not have even begun by January seventh, 
  the lads there would have had hardly any time to get into trouble that required 
  Holmes to clear up. Thus, I would think the second half-moon of the month, which 
  appeared later in the evening on the twentieth according to Zeisler, would be 
  the more likely candidate (even if it means a late supper for the residents 
  of Tuxbury Old Park).<br>
  Thus, I&#8217;m going to place this case as beginning on Wednesday, January 21, 
  1903.</p>

  Summer 1903.</p>
<p>THE BIRLSTONE RAILWAY TIMETABLE:<br>
  "The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone" is perhaps the most sadly neglected 
  case in the world of Sherlockian chronology. While the elder chronologists have 
  jumped through hoops to date many another case on scant facts, they seem to 
  collectively toss up their hands at this one and say, "Why bother!"<br>
  Well, if their Associated Shades are reading this from some Sherlockian houseboat 
  on the river Styx, I&#8217;m going to tell them why. For the same reason one 
  tries to date any story in the Canon . . . because it&#8217;s there. And while 
  it may be disrespectful to call one&#8217;s elders "gurly men chronologists" 
  ala Hans and Franz, I&#8217;m going to do just that. And then I&#8217;m going 
  to date this case, if I have to give myself brain fever to do it. So here goes 
  nothing . . .<br>
  First, we know that the story takes place after February 13, 1892. Watson is 
  returning to Baker Street after an absence, an absence of long enough that he&#8217;s 
  surprised to find it unchanged. Billy is still there, as well.<br>
  While Watson did desert Holmes for a wife in 1902, he wasn&#8217;t gone from 
  Baker Street long enough for him to be quite so amazed in returning to Baker 
  Street at any time before Holmes left those rooms for Sussex. No, Watson&#8217;s 
  reaction harkens back to a time when he was still surprised to find 221B unchanged 
  after its chief tenant had been dead for three years. A time of air guns and 
  wax dummies. And a time when the flat disc gramophone was just taking off.<br>
  The year 1894.<br>
  "Before my time," Billy says of the use of a wax dummy in "Empty 
  House," yet we saw in "The Valley of Fear" that the page was 
  around during Moriarty&#8217;s career. If Billy was Holmes&#8217;s employee, rather 
  than Mrs. Hudson&#8217;s, it would make sense that he would be let go at Holmes&#8217;s 
  "death" and hired back shortly after the events of "Empty House" 
  &#8212; thus the first dummy was before his time (and after his time as well). 
  Billy&#8217;s return and Watson&#8217;s first encounter with him also explains 
  Watson&#8217;s reiteration of how unchanged 221B is, even though we know the 
  doctor has been here before since Holmes&#8217;s return.<br>
  So it&#8217;s summer of 1894, yet early enough in summer that Watson and Billy 
  are just becoming reacquainted as Sherlock Holmes rebuilds his life. As busy 
  as 1894 was for Holmes and Watson, that would be extremely early . . . something 
  possibly as early as June 1. And as June 1, 1894 fell on a Friday, which times 
  out nicely with Sylvius&#8217;s projected timetable for cutting the diamond up 
  in Amsterdam by Sunday, I&#8217;m going to place "Mazarin Stone" on 
  that very date.</p>

  Near June 1, 1896.</p>
<p>THE BIRLSTONE RAILWAY TIMETABLE:<br>
  Sherlock Holmes isn&#8217;t acting very much like Sherlock Holmes in this case. 
  He lets Mrs. Maberly search for clues for him. He goes to Langdale Pike for 
  what amounts to the solution to the case. A prize-fighter is involved, but Holmes&#8217;s 
  own boxing connections are never brought up. Holmes seems something of a sociality 
  in the way he knows of young Maberly without consulting his commonplace book. 
  Baker Street is never specifically mentioned. There&#8217;s just something very 
  wrong about it all, and it should be fairly apparent what that something is:<br>
  Sherlock Holmes is not actually involved in this case. <br>
  In an earlier Chronology Corner, we saw how Watson was hallucinating Holmes&#8217;s 
  presence in March of 1892 during "Wisteria Lodge," and in "The 
  Adventure of the Three Garridebs," he&#8217;s taken it a step further. No 
  mere hallucination could account for Holmes&#8217;s bizarre behaviour in this 
  case. I would propose that in his attempts to come to grips with Holmes&#8217;s 
  loss, Dr. Watson used the royalties from his now successful writing career to 
  set up shop with a new detective as a partner, a pseudo-Sherlock. <br>
  "I remember your husband well, madam," the faux-Sherlock lies to Mrs. 
  Maberly at one point, "though it is some years since he used my services 
  in some trifling matter." Luckily for "Sherlock," she had not 
  met Holmes before, as her husband had been one of his early clients.<br>
  Mrs. Maberly&#8217;s son has died of pneumonia a month earlier in Rome, which 
  isn&#8217;t exactly a cold city. The average minimum temperature there in January 
  doesn&#8217;t even hit the freezing mark. Sure, one can die of pneumonia any 
  time of the year, but a vital young man like Maberly, even a beaten, heartbroken 
  one probably could use the extra encouragement of winter to die in such a way 
  in Rome.<br>
  Christmas is a time for marriage proposals, and an especially tragic time for 
  a rejection. Maberly persists after the object of his affection, insisting that 
  she be his and his alone. A week later, on New Year&#8217;s Eve, Douglas Maberly 
  is beaten outside of his former love&#8217;s window, winding up lying on that 
  cold London street long enough to catch a chill that will start him on his downward 
  trend. His mother accompanies him to Rome, getting her first taste of travel 
  but seeing her "gallant boy turn into a worn-out cynical man." Once 
  in Rome, all the son does is decline and write, sending the book off to Isadora 
  the moment his pen leaves the last page. Without his vengeful purpose of writing 
  left to sustain him further, Douglas Maberly dies. <br>
  His mother returns to London, hires fresh servants (at which time the spy, Susan, 
  enters her household), and a month later, consults "Sherlock Holmes" 
  on Wednesday, March 15, 1893.<br>
  Why March 15? You surely didn&#8217;t think the prophecy "Beware the ides 
  of March!" was about a mere Roman emperor, did you? It was a warning that 
  future generations would have to endure "The Adventure of the Three Gables."</p>

<p>THE BIRLSTONE RAILWAY TIMETABLE:<br>
  When looking for the year of "The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire," 
  the best source to begin our search would have to be Holmes&#8217;s good old 
  index. That eclectic compendium of criminal data has much to tell the observant 
  scholar, so let&#8217;s observe.<br>
  "Voyage of the Gloria Scott" comes first. As Holmes&#8217;s very first 
  case, that comes as no surprise, but it also tells us there is a certain time-related 
  sequence to the events therein. But at what point did Holmes include "Vampirism 
  in Transylvania"? Well, a good many of his own cases fill the pages before 
  we get to it. Given the relative low occurrence of the letter "V" 
  in phone books, dictionaries, etc., we can safely say that piece wasn&#8217;t 
  placed there early in his career. Later in his career, we would expect such 
  data to come less from his studies than from newspapers and periodicals. And 
  why would newspapers and periodicals suddenly be writing about vampires?<br>
  Bram Stoker&#8217;s Dracula, first published in 1897, would seem the logical 
  inspiration for a sudden return of ancient myths to current events. So if the 
  vampire reference tends to make the case post 1897, where to go from there?<br>
  Well, the history of Peru doesn&#8217;t look too good up until the early 1890s. 
  Things didn&#8217;t really stabilize there until 1895, when a new president stepped 
  in after a year of power struggles. Throw in the five year marriage of the Fergusons, 
  and the most likely year for this case quickly starts to look like 1901, a time 
  when Watson and Holmes were both still at Baker Street.<br>
  Given that marvelous London mail service, and the November 19th letter&#8217;s 
  delivery by the last post, this one looks like Tuesday, November 19, 1901 to 
  me.</p>

<p>WHAT ZEISLER, THE KING OF CHRONOLOGY, SAYS:<br>

<p>THE BIRLSTONE RAILWAY TIMETABLE:<br>
  A combination of three factors give us the date of "The Adventure of the

  1. The case starts two days after the Tuesday meeting of the Garridebs.<br>
  2. The case starts in the second half of June 1902.<br>
  3. Watson refers to it as spring.<br>
  Putting those three factors together gives us one date, and one date only: Thursday, 
  June 19, 1902.<br>
  The sun seems to be setting as Holmes gets to Garrideb&#8217;s apartment at the 
  pre-arranged time of six o&#8217;clock, which doesn&#8217;t correspond to near-equinox 
  June whatsoever. This, however, we simply must ascribe to Holmes&#8217;s tardiness.</p>

<p>THE BIRLSTONE RAILWAY TIMETABLE:<br>
  Twenty years before "The Adventure of Thor Bridge," a young, passionate 
  J. Neil Gibson was supposedly gold-hunting on the banks of the Amazon River. 
  As he&#8217;s romancing a city official&#8217;s daughter, we can probably assume 
  he was hunting gold that other people had already found, hence his time spent 
  in the city, rather than the jungle. In the fifteen years that followed, he 
  returned to the United States and was elected to the U.S. Senate for a number 
  of years. After that (as one wouldn&#8217;t think he could get elected with such 
  activities in his past) Gibson broke "communities, cities, even nations" 
  in his rabid pursuit of profit, ruining "ten thousand men" in the 
  process. Having surely made enough enemies in America, Gibson moved to England 
  for five years.<br>
  And when Dr. Watson first meets him, J. Neil Gibson is looking a lot like Abraham 
  Lincoln.<br>
  Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865. As a boy of no more than fourteen 
  at the time of the shocking assassination, Gibson would still regard Lincoln 
  as pure hero, and carry that regard into manhood, doing things like running 
  for Congress and growing a beard to complete his resemblance the Great Emancipator&#8217;s 
  best known image, even while indulging in ruthless business practices that were 
  far from Lincoln&#8217;s style.<br>
  But J. Neil Gibson&#8217;s superficial Lincoln-worship didn&#8217;t just stop 
  with Congress or a beard. He would also propose to a girl of local social prominence 
  named Mary ("Maria" being the Manaos, Brazil equivalent) at age twenty-nine, 
  just as Lincoln had. Twenty years later, Gibson would regret his arbitrary Lincoln 
  emulating, even though the girl had seemed a perfect catch at the time.<br>
  Following this Lincoln-inspired path of J. Neil Gibson&#8217;s life, I would 
  place this case in the year 1900, when October 3 fell on a Wednesday, and the 
  case began the following day: Thursday, October 4, 1900.<br>
  (This would mean, of course, that the cook had to leave the house to pick up 
  a copy of the Family Herald, which was published on Wednesday, but for the reader 
  ardent enough to screw up breakfast the next morning because she just has to 
  read the latest "love romance," that should pose no problem.)</p>

  "This excellent young man&#8217;s diary shows that there was trouble upon 
  July 2d, and from then onward it seems to have been at nine-day intervals, with, 
  so far as I remember, only one exception. Thus the last outbreak upon Friday

  could give us no clearer set of dates, all nicely corresponding to the days

  In dating previous cases, I&#8217;ve always followed the motto, "Trust Watson." 
  One can hardly do less with Holmes, as the detective himself would have to be 
  an even more precise observer &#8212; and this case is all Holmes. If Sherlock 
  Holmes says there was a gale in late July of 1907, then we can surely assume 
  there was a gale in late July of 1907, even if standard weather historians have 
  missed it. Thus, we can place this case on Tuesday, July 30, 1907, and let disbelievers 
  like Baring-Gould and Zeisler think what they like.</p>

<p>WHAT THE BARING-GOULD ANNOTATED SAYS:<br>
  October 1896. </p>
<p>WHAT ZEISLER, THE KING OF CHRONOLOGY, SAYS: <br>
  October 1896.</p>
<p>THE BIRLSTONE RAILWAY TIMETABLE:<br>
  Finding the date of "The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger" seems to 
  be intimately connected to finding the date of the original Abbas Parva tragedy. 
  Previous chronologists have used Watson&#8217;s presence at Baker Street as a 
  key indicator in this search, but the true answers lie far from that locale, 
  as far away as the circus itself where the tragedy occurred.<br>
  Mrs. Ronder&#8217;s worsening mental state would have to be attributed to a powerful 
  combination of two events: the death notice of Leonardo the strong man and the 
  coming anniversary of the tragedy itself. So when did the tragedy occur? Though 
  we generally think of circuses running in a season from March to October, I&#8217;ve 
  run into at least one source that mentions Boxing Day, December 26, as the official 
  start of the circus season. While that may seem plenty early, Ronder&#8217;s 
  fellow showman George Sanger ran his circus for a nine-month season, which &#8212; 
  if it indeed began in late December to catch the holiday crowds &#8212; would 
  bring it to an end as October rolled around. <br>
  If October meant the end of the cirus season for Ronder&#8217;s Wild Beast Show, 
  it would make sense that Eugenia and Leonardo wanted to kill Ronder before the 
  season&#8217;s end, sometime in late September. If the tragedy&#8217;s anniversary 
  fell in late September, and Eugenia Ronder&#8217;s dread of it began earlier 
  in the month, Leonardo&#8217;s death while swimming would have occurred, quite 
  naturally, in August, a fine month for swimming.<br>
  As the Ronder show was "camping and not exhibiting" on the night of 
  the tragedy, one would expect it to be a Sunday night &#8212; the traditional 
  night off for circuses of the day &#8212; as even near a small town, a slavedriver 
  like Ronder would hope to pick up a few coins. With the Wimbledon shows still 
  ahead of them, that would most likely place the tragedy on Sunday, September 
  22, 1889.<br>
  "On this particular night, seven years ago," Holmes says with enough 
  appropriate drama to make one believe that the day Mrs. Merrilow has come to 
  see them is the actual anniversary of the tragedy: Tuesday, September 22, 1896.<br>
  (Watson says "it was late in 1896," yes, but the remark is so casual 
  as to let one believe in could be anywhere in the later half of 1896, and September 
  certainly qualifies.)</p>

  May 6, 1902. </p>
<p>WHAT ZEISLER, THE KING OF CHRONOLOGY, SAYS:<br>
  May 6, 1902.</p>
<p>THE BIRLSTONE RAILWAY TIMETABLE:<br>
  "The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place" begins in May, according to 
  Watson, and two weeks and one day before the Derby, according to Sir Robert&#8217;s 
  desire for three week&#8217;s time when his sister died. To figure out which 
  year Sir Robert&#8217;s Derby took place, one could calculate the phases of the 
  moon, the times the moon would rise on all the appropriate evenings and the 
  amount of light each of those moonrises would project through recorded cloud 
  cover in Berkshire. Or one could take the route Holmes takes in this case and 
  just go fishing.<br>
  Wait a minute . . . Holmes goes fishing during this case? He hasn&#8217;t been 
  fishing since Trevor senior first put him on to the detective biz, way back 
  in "The Gloria Scott"! Sherlock Holmes suddenly deciding to go fishing 
  while on the job is a perfect example of what a 9-to-5 office denizen would 
  call "vacation mode." He can see the finish line, and he&#8217;s starting 
  to slack off in anticipation of it. He&#8217;s headed for that life of nature 
  in Sussex, and sees an opportunity to slip a little nature in early.<br>
  On that basis, and that basis alone, this case has to take place in 1903, the 
  detective&#8217;s last year in active practice. Derby Day in 1903 took place 
  on June 3, which then places the case&#8217;s beginning two weeks and a day earlier 
  on Tuesday, May 26, 1903.</p>

<p>WHAT THE BARING-GOULD ANNOTATED SAYS:<br>
  Thursday, July 28, 1898. </p>
<p>WHAT ZEISLER, THE KING OF CHRONOLOGY, SAYS:<br>
  July or August 1898.</p>
<p>THE BIRLSTONE RAILWAY&#8217;S TIMETABLE:<br>
  The summer of 1898 was not a good time for Sherlock Holmes. In mid-August, his 
  too-late deciphering of the "Dancing Men" code had resulted in a man&#8217;s 
  death and the horrible wounding of his wife. Was that event the cause of his 
  melancholy at the beginning of "Retired Colourman" and words like 
  "But is not all life pathetic and futile?" I think so.<br>
  Other chronologers have used the closing of Barrie&#8217;s "The Little Minister" 
  at the Haymarket theater as their base in dating this case, but as the ticket 
  Amerberly shows Watson is for a seat that didn&#8217;t exist in the Haymarket 
  as we know it, that seems a bit more unreliable than Holmes&#8217;s sincere depression 
  occurring so near to a tragedy which he himself could have stopped.<br>
  As bi-weekly newspapers tend to have a mid-week edition in my experience, and 
  five days (one for Carina, one for Little Purlington, one for the arrest, and 
  two for the paper to come out) prior to that gives us Saturday, the perfect 
  evening for Holmes to distract himself with a concert, I&#8217;m going to place 
  this case on Saturday, August 20, 1898.</p>
