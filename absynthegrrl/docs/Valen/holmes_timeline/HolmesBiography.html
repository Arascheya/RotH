<p>On Saturday, July 3, 1880, the traditional English university long vacation 
  began, and with it, the beginning of the brilliant career of Mr. Sherlock Holmes, 
  consulting detective.</p>
<p>"It seems to me that all the detectives of fact and fancy would be children 
  in your hands," a justice of the peace named Trevor told the young man. 
  "That&#8217;s your line of life, sir, and you may take the word of a man 
  who has seen something of the world."</p>
<p>Trevor, of course, turned out to be a escaped criminal who gained his freedom 
  when the prison ship "Gloria Scott" was overrun and blown up on November 
  6, 1855, "when the Crimean War was at its height." Both Trevor and 
  his fellow survivor of the tragedy, a sailor named Hudson, are quoted that the 
  incident was being thirty years before, when their true words had to be more 
  like "three decades ago." In the intervening decades, the 1860s and 
  1870s, Trevor had time to settle in England and raise a son to college age. 
  That son, Victor Trevor, would eventually befriend Sherlock Holmes, invite him 
  home for the long vacation, and introduce him to his father: the man who would 
  steer Holmes on to the path of detection.</p>
<p>After staying with the Trevor family for less than a month, Sherlock Holmes 
  returns to his London rooms, where he spends the rest of the vacation doing 
  experiments in organic chemistry. 1881</p>
<p>On Thursday, June 23, 1881, Reginald Musgrave comes to call on Sherlock Holmes, 
  to ask for his help in the matter of the Musgrave Ritual. Holmes is now living 
  on Montague Street, around the corner from the British Museum. The Ritual has 
  a variety of puzzles to it, one of which being that must be performed six months 
  from the First . . . Charles the First, who died on January 30, 1649.</p>
<p>On Saturday, July 16, 1881, Holmes spends the day working in the chemical laboratory 
  at St. Bart&#8217;s Hospital. In the morning, he complains to a young medical 
  man named Stamford about not being able to find someone to go halves on some 
  nice rooms he&#8217;s found in Baker Street. In the afternoon, Stamford brings 
  a retired army surgeon named John H. Watson into the lab to inquire about sharing 
  rooms. The next day, Holmes and Watson go together to inspect their potential 
  domicile at 221B Baker Street. They make the arrangements then and there with 
  the landlady, a woman by the name of Hudson, and Watson starts moving in that 
  night. Holmes starts moving in the next morning, Monday, July 18. Within a few 
  weeks, a fellow named Lestrade starts visiting Holmes there.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1883</b></font></p>
<p>On Sunday, April 1, 1883, heiress Helen Stoner shows up at 221B Baker Street 
  shortly after seven in the morning, fearful of a mysterious "speckled band" 
  that was responsible for the death of her twin sister. Sherlock Holmes takes 
  her case and saves her life.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1884</b></font></p>
<p>On Tuesday, March 4, 1884, Tobias Gregson of Scotland Yard sends Holmes a letter, 
  asking for his help on a matter involving a dead American found in an empty 
  house. Holmes eventually captures the man&#8217;s killer at 221B Baker Street, 
  but not before another American is also killed.</p>
<p>On Saturday, March 29, 1884, hop merchant Grant Munro comes to Baker Street 
  from Norbury to seek Holmes&#8217;s advice on his wife&#8217;s suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>Also this year, Holmes arranges an affair for Fairdale Hobbs of Great Orme 
  Street.</p>
<p> <b><font size="+1">1885</font></b></p>
<p>On Tuesday, January 6, 1885, Fairdale Hobbs&#8217;s landlady, Mrs. Warren, comes 
  to see Holmes about another of her lodgers. Tobias Gregson and a Pinkerton detective 
  named Leverton are on the trail of a multiple murderer named BlackGorgiano, 
  and Holmes helps them as well. Holmes and Watson also attend Wagner night at 
  Covent Garden.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1886</b></font></p>
<p>On Friday, February 26, 1886, Alexander Holder of the banking firm, Holder 
  &amp; Stevenson of Threadneedle, consults Holmes about some missing collateral, 
  which Holmes recovers for him</p>
<p>On Saturday, October 2, 1886, Dr. Percy Trevelyan comes to bring Sherlock Holmes 
  to see his paranoid landlord.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1887</b></font></p>
<p>On Monday, February 14, 1887, Sherlock Holmes begins his two-month-long investigation 
  of Baron Maupertuis and the Netherland Sumatra Company, spending over fifteen 
  hours a day working on the case (including one five day marathon of detection).</p>
<p>On Thursday, April 14, 1887, Holmes is ill with exhaustion and depression, 
  resting at the Hotel Dulong in Lyons, France.</p>
<p>On Monday, April 25, 1887, Holmes takes a vacation at the home of Colonel Hayter, 
  an old friend and wartime patient of Dr. Watson. While there he investigates 
  a burglary/murder.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, July 19, 1887, the Premier of Britain and the Secretary for European 
  Affairs come to 221B Baker Street, seeking Holmes&#8217;s help in finding a letter 
  from a foreign potentate (believed by this writer to have been U.S. president 
  Grover Cleveland) </p>
<p>Also in July of 1887, Holmes handles a case involving the first families of 
  England, working with Dubuque of the Paris police and Fritz von Waldbaum, the 
  Dantzig specialist. He also takes a case involving a tired captain.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, August 30, 1887, Colonel Barclay of the Royal Munsters at Aldershot 
  dies under mysterious circumstances and Major Murphy requests that Holmes investigate.</p>
<p>On Friday, September 16, 1887, young John Openshaw comes to 221B Baker Street 
  in fear for his life after receiving five orange seeds in the mail.</p>
<p>On Thursday, October 6, 1887, Lord Robert St. Simon comes to Holmes for help 
  in finding his missing bride.</p>
<p>Also in 1887: Holmes tackles cases involving the Paradol Chamber, the Amateur 
  Mendicant Society, the loss of the Sophy Anderson, the Grice Pattersons of the 
  island of Uffa, and a poisoning in Camberwell.</p>
<p><b><font size="+1">1888</font></b></p>
<p>On Saturday, January 7, 1888, Sherlock Holmes gets a coded tip from an informant 
  in the Moriarty organization. At this point, Moriarty does not yet see Holmes 
  as a threat, Scotland Yard doesn&#8217;t see any reason for Holmes&#8217;s suspicions 
  about Moriarty, and the eventual arch-enemies have yet to lock horns.</p>
<p>Between early January and late March, 1888, Holmes travels to Odessa to investigate 
  the Trepoff murder, to Trincomalee to handle the Atkinson tragedy, and to parts 
  unknown on a mission for the Dutch royal family.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, March 20, 1888, Sherlock Holmes is visited by both his married 
  friend Watson and the disguised King of Bohemia, the latter of whom seeks his 
  help in foiling the blackmailer, Irene Adler.</p>
<p>During mid-April, 1888, Holmes becomes in the separation of Mr. And Mrs. Dundas, 
  as well as tracks the missing fiance of Miss Mary Sutherland.</p>
<p>In early June of 1888, Sherlock Holmes begins a thrice daily course of drug 
  injection, morphine at times, cocaine at others.</p>
<p>On the evening of Wednesday, June 20, 1888, Mycroft Holmes consults his brother 
  over the matter of a Greek prisoner held at an unknown location.</p>
<p>On September 4, 1888, Sherlock Holmes discovers the body of Bartholomew Sholto 
  while accompanying Miss Mary Morstan to a mysterious rendezvous.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, October 23, 1888, Holmes receives telegrams from Colonel Ross and 
  Inspector Gregory asking for his help in finding the missing racehorse Silver 
  Blaze. The detective waits until Thursday to investigate, and delays his solution 
  of the case until he has a chance to win money betting on the Wessex Plate on 
  October 30th.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1889</b></font></p>
<p>On Saturday, June 1, 1889, Dr. Watson visits Holmes after three months of barely 
  seeing him, and the two look into the matter of Hall Pycroft&#8217;s strange 
  job. A week later, Holmes interupts Watson&#8217;s breakfast to take him away 
  from his busy medical practice to investigate a murder in Boscombe Valley. On 
  the last Sunday of that same month, Watson will come to Holmes with wounded 
  engineer Victor Hatherly, in search of the young man&#8217;s assailant.</p>
<p>Around mid-May of 1889, Sherlock Holmes is working for the Pope on the little 
  affair of the Vatican cameos and appears to have been out of England. On Friday, 
  August 30, 1889, Holmes is called in by Scotland Yard after a woman receives 
  two severed ears in the mail. Dr. Watson has writtten up a second of Holmes&#8217;s 
  cases, that of The Sign of the Four, but it will not be published until early 
  1890.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, October 1, 1889, Sherlock Holmes first hears the legend of the 
  hellhound of the Baskervilles, a myth whose modern existence he will soon dispel. 
  He is also handling an important blackmail case, and before the next two months 
  are done he will also deal with a card scandal and the defense of an innocent 
  woman against a murder charge.</p>
<p><b><font size="+1">1890</font></b></p>
<p>On Tuesday, March 18, 1890, Holmes is consulted by a job-hunting governess 
  and bemoans the lack of creative criminals &#8211; a state that will soon change.</p>
<p>On Saturday, October 11, 1890, Sherlock Holmes is consulted by red-headed pawnbroker 
  Jabez Wilson on a job he&#8217;s just lost, and Holmes winds up saving a large 
  amount of French gold. And though a bold fellow named John Clay at first takes 
  credit for the foiled scheme, Holmes finally has his hands on the first key 
  he&#8217;s had to the elusive Professor Moriarty&#8217;s organization since the 
  death of "Porlock." </p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1891</b></font></p>
<p>By January of 1891, the detective&#8217;s hidden campaign against Moriarty is 
  fully under way. By January 23, Holmes has cost the criminal mastermind a lieutenant, 
  blackmailer Charles Augustus Milverton. Using the ruse that he is working for 
  the French government on the Continent (concocted with the help of his many 
  friends in France&#8217;s law enforcement community), Holmes goes undercover 
  in London to compile all the evidence he will need to bring down Moriarty&#8217;s 
  organization in one grand stroke.</p>
<p>On Monday, April 27, 1891, Scotland Yard acts upon Holmes&#8217;s word and brings 
  down the whole of Professor Moriarty&#8217;s syndicate, with the exception of 
  two men: Professor Moriarty and Sebastian Moran, who have followed Holmes to 
  Europe. Holmes sends Moriarty to his death in a struggle on the cliffs of Reichenbach 
  Falls, only to be hunted by assassin Sebastian Moran. Holmes flees Europe.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1892-93</b></font></p>
<p>On Tuesday, March 24, 1892, a severely distraught Dr. John H. Watson conjures 
  the delusion of his old friend Sherlock Holmes as he seeks to help Scotland 
  Yard on a case that is inevitably solved by another detective. Watson&#8217;s 
  visitations by this hallucinatory Holmes continue sporadically through mid-March 
  of 1893, when he looks into the mystery surrounding the legacy of young Douglas 
  Maberly. </p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1894</b></font></p>
<p>Shortly before April 3, 1894, word of Watson&#8217;s condition reaches Sherlock 
  Holmes, now in France, who returns to both deal with assassin Sebastian Moran 
  and take Watson under his wing. Holmes rebuilds his former establishment, bringing 
  back Billy the page in June, beginning with the capture of Count Sylvius. A 
  matter concerning ex-president Murillo follows, a remnant of a case handled 
  by Watson and his fabricated Holmes two years earlier. They also come near death 
  in the matter of the Dutch steamship Friesland, and save John Hector McFarlane 
  from a murder charge before the summer is over. Although Watson is now a full 
  partner in his detective agency, Holmes puts Watson under a strict prohibition 
  against writing up any of their cases together. Before the end of the year, 
  they would deal with cases involving a red leech, a banker named Crosby, the 
  Addleton tragedy, an ancient British barrow, the Smith-Mortimer succession case 
  (which would bring them back in contact with Dr. Mortimer of Dartmoor), Huret 
  the boulevard assassin, and a murder and exposure of an anarchist at Yoxley 
  Old Place.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1895</b></font></p>
<p>In April of 1895, Holmes would deal with the persecution of tobacco millionaire 
  John Vincent Harden, the stalking of Miss Violet Smith, and begin a sequence 
  of events that would place him in one of England&#8217;s great university towns 
  by the time May arrived. Before mid-July, Holmes would look into the death of 
  Cardinal Tosca at the request of the Pope, remove an East-end plague spot by 
  arresting a canary-trainer named Wilson, and solve the harpoon-murder of Captain 
  Peter Carey.</p>
<p>On November 21, 1895, Sherlock Holmes would again be consulted by his brother 
  Mycroft, in the theft of the Bruce-Partington submarine plans.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1896-97</b></font></p>
<p>The years 1896 and 1897 would bring Holmes in contact time and again with the 
  remnants of tragedy: the suicidal Eugenia Ronder in September of &#8217;96, the 
  premature death of a college man&#8217;s young wife and the execution of an abusive 
  husband, both in February of &#8217;97, and the madness and death of an entire 
  family in March of that same spring.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1898</b></font></p>
<p>In August of 1898, Holmes is involved in a matter involving two Coptic patriarchs, 
  as well as death of a paint-man&#8217;s wife and best friend.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1900</b></font></p>
<p>On October 4, 1900, Sherlock Holmes will be summoned by the greatest financial 
  magnate of his day, J. Neil Gibson, in matter of his wife&#8217;s murder.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1901</b></font></p>
<p>On May 16, 1901, Holmes will be summoned to find the kidnapped son of the Duke 
  of Holdernesse.</p>
<p>On November 19, 1901, an old acquaintance of Watson&#8217;s contacts Holmes 
  regarding vampires, a thesis Holmes quickly debunks.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1902</b></font></p>
<p>On June 4, 1902, Inspector Lestrade calls Holmes in to deal with a madman&#8217;s 
  pattern crime. Later in that same month, a more harmless case of fraud turns 
  deadly and Watson is shot in the leg by an American killer.</p>
<p>On July 26, 1902, Holmes sends Watson to Europe first-class, to look into the 
  mysterious disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax. The matter is eventually solved 
  back in London, but Watson gets a good vacation out of it.</p>
<p>In September of 1902, Sherlock Holmes is severely beaten as he tries to prevent 
  the marriage of murderer Adelbert Gruner.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1903</b></font></p>
<p>In January of 1903, Dr. Watson has left the partnership again, and Holmes handles 
  matters involving the Duke of Greyminster, the Sultan of Turkey, and the appearance 
  of a Boer War veteran&#8217;s missing comrade. In May of that year, Holmes will 
  handle the murders of a St. Pancras policeman and Lady Beatrice Falder. </p>
<p>In September of 1903, Watson will begin publishing the stories gathered in 
  The Return of Sherlock Holmes, and anyone who didn&#8217;t know Holmes was alive 
  again most certainly did now. In that same month, Holmes would deal with the 
  odd behavior of Professor Presbury.</p>
<p>In late October of 1903, Sherlock Holmes would investigate the death of Victor 
  Savage, the last case of Holmes&#8217;s professional career before his retirement 
  to Sussex Downs. In November, Holmes would move out of London to take up the 
  study of nature in general and beekeeping in specific. In the next nine years, 
  Holmes would write and publish the book Practical Handbook of Bee Culture, with 
  Some Observations upon the Segregation of the Queen.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1907</b></font></p>
<p>On July 30, 1907, Sherlock Holmes would take up the one case we know of during 
  his retirement years, the murder of Fitzroy McPherson.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>1912-14</b></font></p>
<p>In the summer of 1912, the Premier and the Foreign Minister come to Holmes 
  asking him to come out of retirement to bring down a spy network. Holmes travels 
  to America, to Chicago, to begin his infiltration, which will take him from 
  America, to Ireland, and back to Britain as a bitter Irish-American named Altamont. 
  In August of 1914, he would enlist Watson&#8217;s help in the finish of his case 
  and the capture of German master spy Von Bork. Holmes returns to London with 
  Watson and Von Bork, and that is the last we have recorded of him.</p>
