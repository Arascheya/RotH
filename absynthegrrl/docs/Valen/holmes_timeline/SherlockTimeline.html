<p>What follows is the basic timeline resulting from my attempts to put dates 
  to Watson&#8217;s sixty stories. In parentheses next to each title is a code 
  specifying what part or parts of the date come directly from Watson&#8217;s pen 
  (or Holmes&#8217;s pen, in those cases he wrote himself): "Y" for year, 
  "M" for month, "D" for day, "Wd" for weekday, 
  and "S" for season. For chronological info from the story and the 
  rational for placing each story at the given date, just click on the story title 
  link. For a handy intro to this study of Dr. Watson's dates, try the essay below

      <p><font size="+2"><b>The great "almost known"</b></font></p>
      <p>The puzzle of the pyramids. The riddle of Stonehenge. The unknowable 
        source of the heads of the Easter Islands. Great mysteries, all of these, 
        yet they fairly pale in comparison to the challenge provided by the internal 
        dates of the John H. Watson&#8217;s Sherlock Holmes stories. Sometimes 
        he tells us the exact day on which a case begins. Sometimes he doesn&#8217;t 
        even mention as much as a day of the week in an entire story. And sometimes 
        he mentions days or dates that seem, at face value, impossible. Watson 
        teases us with just enough hard facts to make us think his tales can be 
        easily put to a historical calendar, then pulls the rug out from under 
        us, time and again.</p>
      <p>A great unknown is quite a thing, but what of a great "almost known" 
        such as the one true sequence of Watson&#8217;s stories? It is a mystery 
        forever at the edge of our fingertips, yet forever out of reach. Many 
        have tried to produce the definitive sequence of these tales, and many 
        have failed &#8212; one might even say "dying in the attempt," 
        for the pursuit of the true Watsonian chronology is a lifelong endeavor. 
        Even the best of chronologers date the tales and then date them again 
        after further study. It&#8217;s a challenge that never ends. A puzzle that 
        will never be solved.</p>
      <p>Yet, as impossible as the task may seem, as unknowable as Watson&#8217;s 
        calendar might be, we have to try. It is truly the Mount Everest of Sherlockian 
        scholarship, the one great peak some Sherlockians must climb, once they 
        finally give up the chronological training wheels of the sequence used 
        in Baring-Gould&#8217;s <i>The Annotated Sherlock Holmes</i> and find themselves 
        unsatisfied by anyone else&#8217;s attempt. Some Sherlockians start this 
        early in their Sherlockian careers, some late in the Game, some not at 
        all (don&#8217;t know whether that&#8217;s intelligence, or just plain old 
        sanity). But the challenge is always there, looming over us, waiting.</p>
      <p>It took me two attempts to make it all the way through the sixty Sherlock 
        Holmes stories in an attempt to decode Watson&#8217;s dates. The first 
        time, in the early nineties, I gathered all the data, but was more timid 
        in drawing my conclusions. The second time, beginning in September of 
        2000, I had just signed on as discussion leader for the Hounds of the 
        Internet. That elder on-line group discusses the sixty Holmes tales at 
        the rapid rate of one per week, and in addition to supplying discussion 
        questions I told the Hounds that I would supply a weekly study of dating 
        that week&#8217;s tale. I called the weekly feature "Chronology Corner," 
        and used it as a ploy to force myself to put dates to all sixty stories. 
        The ploy worked.</p>
      <p>Every Monday, I posted some notes and conclusions on finding the beginning 
        date of the story for that week, quoting key dating points from the story, 
        the dates two important past chronologers had claimed were the beginning 
        point of the tales, and my own feeble (and eventually maniacal &#8212; 
        wait for "Silver Blaze") attempts to pin down those same points. 
        I called my own small part of those studies "The Birlstone Railway 
        Timetable," to go with my Hounds nickname, "The Birlstone Railway 
        Smash," and used every form of logic, illogic, and as much as I hate 
        to say it, flat-out guesses to put dates to those tales.</p>
      <p>You may find that my personal judgement calls and rules of chronology 
        may be totally antithetical to your own. I like doing original research 
        first, drawing my conclusions, and only then consulting past chronologers. 
        I don&#8217;t like bending or breaking plainly stated dates just to keep 
        Watson monogamous, as some Sherlockians have done. And while some like 
        to see Sherlockian scholarship as a science, I am one of those who definitely 
        views it as an art, subject to the occasional whim and style-based choice. 
        But my own conclusions were never intended to be the last word on the 
        subject, merely something to occupy my own brain and perhaps encourage 
        others to try solving the puzzle themselves. That is the truly great thing 
        about studying the lives of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson . . . unless 
        some very astonishing and authentic hard evidence turns up, we will never 
        have definitive final answers. Each Sherlockian is forever left to draw 
        one&#8217;s own conclusions, no matter how much one&#8217;s fellow Sherlockians 
        try to help one out.</p>
      <p>Thus, this collection of quotes and theories is not intended as a pleasant 
        evening&#8217;s read. You&#8217;ll bore yourself silly if you try to use 
        it so. It is not intended to be a complete and thorough record of all 
        work on the subject done before. There are other works for that. The purpose 
        of this collection is two-fold: First, as shelf-filler for the completist 
        Sherlockian collector (I love helping those guys out!). And second, as 
        one more aid for those rare future Sherlockian adventurers attempting 
        to chart their own chronal course through Watson&#8217;s chronicles.</p>
      <p>Could one of those adventurers be you? Only one person can decide that, 
        and he&#8217;s not someone from the dusty pages of the past.</p>
      <p>While a number of excellent and brave Sherlockian scholars have attempting 
        putting dates to Watson&#8217;s tales over the years, I only use two of 
        them at touch-stones in this text. The first is William S. Baring-Gould, 
        whose popular work <i>The Annotated Sherlock Holmes</i> provided the most 
        commonly accepted set of dates among the fans of Holmes. The second was 
        Ernest Bloomfield Zeisler, whom I got into the habit of calling "the 
        King of Chronology." Why?</p>
      <p>There have been a lot of excellent laborers in Watson&#8217;s date orchard, 
        but something about Zeisler&#8217;s <i>Baker Street Chronology</i> has 
        always impressed me. Chronology is something that most fans of Sherlock 
        Holmes may find dreary and dull, but Zeisler dove headlong into the topic 
        without any sidelights on other aspects of Holmes&#8217;s cases, without 
        making any pretense at doing a biography. Zeisler was into chronology 
        for chronology&#8217;s sake, and one has to admire such pure devotion.</p>
      <p>Yet as much as I do admire the guy, and even though I may call him the 
        "King" of this specialty of Sherlockian study on occasion, it 
        doesn&#8217;t mean his dates are any more valid than those posited by Henry 
        Folsom, John Hall, Gavin Brend, D. Martin Dakin, or any others of the 
        ever-growing legion of students in the field. Heck, you yourself could 
        place a set of dates on Watson&#8217;s works with just as much validity 
        of any of these gentlemen of the past, for past a certain line in Watsonian 
        chronology, it&#8217;s all interpretation. (And what you can sell other 
        people on. Simply because he plopped his own dates right in the center 
        of his landmark <i>The Annotated Sherlock Holmes, </i>William S. Baring-Gould 
        became the most consulted chronologer of all, despite some questionable 
        choices along the way.)</p>
      <p>As Sherlockian fun moves into the new century, you can bet we&#8217;re 
        going to be seeing some brand new variations on the Grand Old Game of 
        Sherlock Holmes scholarship. Things like role-playing, virtual reality, 
        and alternate history Holmeses all have great potential for pushing the 
        borders of the real estate at 221B Baker Street out to entirely new expanses. 
        We can define the world of Sherlock Holmes in entirely new mediums, and 
        fill out the gray areas with research and imagination like never before. 
        And as we map out the three dimensional world of Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s 
        Victorian Earth, the fourth dimension &#8212; time &#8212; will also need 
        its reference points flagged as well. </p>
      <p>So whether you&#8217;re headed this way for your own entertainment or 
        in building the structure for some greater project, what follows are notes 
        from my own expedition into the chronology of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. 
        Watson. Take what you can use, and don&#8217;t hold the rest against me.</p>
