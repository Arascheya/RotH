<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Chapter 4</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Time lost meaning for Valen as she and Jones hung there in the dark. The ship slowly rotated and drifted along its last velocity vectors. In the distance there was a small flash of light, a few minutes later there was another. A long time later Kara floated back into the bridge. "I’ve got good news and some bad. The containment system is fine, but the engineering monitors aren’t working. There’s probably enough power to do a re-start if I knew what our system status was."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What’s that?" Valen asked as another flash of light came from near one of the drifting pursuit ships.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Probably exploding containment pods. If the others were effected the way we were it’s likely they are running into trouble when they try and bring their engines back online. It’s a common problem with the military GED hyperdrives. The auto-protection system dumps the containment unit as the fields collapse and it explodes. If I can’t figure out the status of our system it could happen if I tried a blind restart also. After that it would be waiting to either freeze or be rescued." After a few moments of thought she continued, "Is there anything in all that stuff you had put on board at Karanal that might help?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen thought a few moments before she replied, "I have a couple of interface units we could try." She continued to gently stoke Jones head as she quietly spoke to him, "We need to go get the power back on. Could you let me up?" After one last careful snuggle, he slowly disentangled himself from her and launched himself toward the other bridge chair. Valen disengaged her harness and maneuvered to follow Kara and her light through the dark corridors until they came to Valen’s cabin. Valen quickly sorted through the small stack of containers strapped into the far corner until she came up with three interface units. Then they threaded their way through the dark maze of corridors to the engineering section.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once there Kara directed Valen to the hyperdrive control equipment. Kara pointed at a section of access panels as she floated to a cabinet and picked out a screwdriver. Easing herself back over to the unit she grabbed a part of it and held herself close while she opened the panel with her other hand. Then she motioned Valen over. "This is the main control section." Revealed in the light were the neat rows of control and interface cards.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen scanned them until she caught sight of a particular one. "That one," she said pointing to one on the top row, left edge. "Could you pull that one out and let me see it?" A couple more deft moves with the screwdriver and Kara pulled it out. Valen quickly examined it with a practiced eye. "You really have gone first class here, haven’t you? I would never have expected a mil-spec interface, and one of the latest revisions at that. This makes it much easier." Valen stated, impressed. She set two of her interface cards drifting and pulled a large assembly loose from the last one.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’ve been paying good credits to keep this system in top form. On the fringe it's saved me more than once," Kara answered with a smile.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Carefully Valen aligned the assembly with a series of connectors on the card Kara was holding. "This is a Teacher Module. You probably could have had this at you last upgrade if you’d spent another twenty thousand credits."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I was told thirty thousand. Remember, I can’t buy through military channels."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It was designed so a tech could plug a standard terminal into it and then the system would teach the terminal how to display its data. What I am going to do is plug myself into it and let it teach my implant how to show me the data, this is going to take a while though. What you could do is bring me the Icicle Everclear from the galley."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A drink? You want a drink right now?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"My implant runs on a combination of batteries and an alcohol fuel cell. The energy pulse that took down Ghost Wind also took down my batteries. I need the Everclear to recharge." As she spoke she attached the data cable to the interface and handed it back to Kara to put back into the hyperdrive. Then she plugged the other end of the cable into her skull jack. "Could you reset the system processor please?" When the start-up message appeared at her interface she triggered the teach function and settled back to wait. Carefully she slipped her hand into the open card bay and lightly hooked her fingers around one of the extraction handles. Calmly she floated near the unit while a small display tracked the assimilation process in her implant.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara returned a few minutes later with a large no-grav drink container filled with liquid. "Here. Anything else I can do?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm afraid not. Just settle back and wait. How much air do we have?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"As much as we need. Ghost Wind has the bio-scrubbers from Tyranthilium Botany. As long as there is nutrient solution we will have air. Heat, or lack of it, is what will kill us."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How long would that take if we don't get the power back on?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not sure really. We have a good hull to volume ratio so cooling will be slower than some ships. I'd guess we would start feeling it in an hour or two."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen had just settled back to wait when another pulse ripped through the ship. Once again pain surged, then stopped as the implant went off-line. It took a few moments longer this time for the pain to clear and for her to trigger the reboot. As the fog in her mind finally cleared she noticed Kara staring at her. "What just happened?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Another energy pulse. Reset it again would you please?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Reset. It should be coming up now. You seem very pre-occupied, want to talk about it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not really. It’s the same as before, mostly...just thinking...I envy you. You can come and go as you please. There aren’t many people you are beholden to...I don’t know...then I started thinking what I could do about the Razaks. Somehow I need to get the word out, but I haven’t any ideas yet..." Her voice trailed away into silence.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They sat lost in their own thoughts for a while until Kara asked, "Would it help to talk about it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don’t know," Valen paused for a long time before continuing, "I guess what I keep wondering more than anything is what you want from me. Nobody does anything without wanting something in return."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Is that what you think? Is that what this is all about then? I helped you because it’s what people do. I wouldn’t be here if a stranger hadn’t helped me escape from my father’s men. I was in a place to help you so I did."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And you don’t want anything in return? I find that hard to believe."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, maybe I do want something, but maybe you are already giving it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure I am," Valen replied with a smirk.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes you are cynical one. Once I knew who you were I wanted to know more about you. Few Eritsani could stare down a blaster and you are the first Gawakt, um Grounder, I’ve met who could. That is what I am getting in return. And quite nicely too I might add."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There is a delicious irony in that you know. Calling Grounders absolutely crazy, it's what most of them say about you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ah yes, so you came across that word as well..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"One of the first I learned. It's a favorite among my detractors."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They lapsed back into silence moments before another pulse ripped through the ship. This one brought tears to Valen’s eyes as she asked for another reset on the hyperdrive. "These are getting stronger each time and coming closer together."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What about the teaching program? Will you be able to get through it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I didn’t loose much with that pulse, so I think so...did you feel anything?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This time I think I did, kind of like a static charge running along my skin." Kara replied as they settled back to wait again. "Are you in any danger from these pulses?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don’t think so. So far it takes the cyberware briefly off-line, but I can get it back immediately. I am surprised though, it is supposed to be immune to electro-magnetic pulse kinds of things. Could you tell me about the Eritsani while we wait?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone always asks, sooner or later." Kara responded bitterly. "Yes we have killed our children. I won’t try and justify it to you. All I will say is in the void with every adult having vital abilities needed to keep the Ship alive, the children are the only ones that can be spared when there is no way for all to survive. The adults can have more children, but the children cannot spontaneously gain the vital knowledge of the adults."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hold on, stop. I wasn’t going to ask you about that. Although like everyone I have heard the rumors and the epithets leveled at you. I have no call to criticize, there’s enough blood on my own hands. No, I was more interested in your history, your customs. The things that keep you unique in the great crucible that is the Empire."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There’s much to tell, what would you like to know?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Your history. Where did you come from? Things like that..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Legend has it we came from the birthworld. We were the outcasts, the misfits. Those considered expendable on the first space projects. The seven mothers banded together and bound us in blood and decreed the ways of us. They forged us into the Eritsani and held us together in the beginnings when the Grounders sought to split us and expend us for their own greed. There are oral traditions and legends from that time, but they are so confused and contradictory that to try and view them as actual history is to fail. They are more an allegory of how we banded together and fought for our place in the universe."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There was one though whose name has come down as the greatest of us. She was named Kalimayani Karakinska and I am named for her. She forged the bands of iron that kept us together and protected us from without. She was the most ruthless of the Mothers, the enforcer and persuader when there was resistance. There are so many accounts of her doings that it seems impossible for her to have been one person."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"My mother believes I have a ‘great destiny’ awaiting me. I have no clue as to what its supposed to be but she says she followed tradition and had our clan’s wise mother do a seeing for me on the seventh day after my birth. Anyway, the term Eritsani comes from the original seven wise mothers of the resulting matriarchal council. All Eritsani families can trace their roots back to one of those seven women."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As she paused a small green image blinked into Valen's vision. "Looks as if the teaching is complete. What do you want me to do?" As she finished speaking another pulse ripped through her. "Ahhhh," she gasped. "That was bad. What, what do we do next?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"First tell the system to initialize itself and watch for any errors."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen gave the command and waited as the system reloaded and reset itself. "Everything’s good."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"OK, now run the detailed test routines on the self test system. If that comes back alright run the system diagnostics."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A few moments later Valen replied, "Still good."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"OK, this is the critical part. Check the energy level in the containment backup power system. If it’s above fifty percent we can safely use it for a restart. If it’s below fifty percent it’d most likely trigger containment drop and we’d dump our power system into space."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Its right at fifty percent. What does that mean?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well it means we have an even chance of getting a restart or having a containment failure and dumping our fuel core. So, we have a few choices - stay here and wait for rescue, try for a restart and have it work, have it fail and leave us stranded here waiting for rescue, or have it fail and vaporize us because the fuel core didn’t jettison."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen stared intently at Kara for long minutes then said quietly, "I don’t dare let myself fall into security’s hands. There is a lot of stuff in my head that they shouldn’t have, including the implant technology. If you want to wait for rescue I’d like to use one of your life pods."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don’t think rescue would be a good idea either. They know we were on Karanal and they’ll want to squeeze everything we know out of us." Kara paused for a few moments, then continued very slowly, "I think we should try for a restart after rigging the core ejector so it won’t function. No reason to leave things to chance." She finished with a strained grin. "Damn, I knew you’d be trouble." She moved to an access panel and slowly worked it open. Once inside she set about disconnecting several connectors under a small control panel. "There’s no guarantee it would have worked anyway..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As Kara worked Valen scanned as quickly as she could through the engineering information on the ship. Satisfied that Kara had gotten the correct connections she said nothing. Kara finished, closed the panel and turned back to Valen. "If you are ready activate the AutoStart Sequencer." Answering the unspoken question in Valen's eyes she continued, "The manual procedure wouldn’t gain anything, but it might give the system time to shut down rather than overload."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Another pulse ripped through the ship forcing a shriek of agony from Valen. This one was strong enough even Kara felt it. "Valen? Are you ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, just a minute." She closed her eyes and concentrated. "Reset the system again, I think I’m ok now." She gave the AutoStart command and waited as the sequence scrolled across her awareness. She looked up at Kara, exhaustion pooled in her eyes. "Ok the system is stable. Please get us out of here, I don’t think I could handle another pulse." Kara moved to help Valen unplug from the hyperdrive. "No, leave me connected, just in case. Now go, please, quickly."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With a last look Kara headed to the bridge. She set nav for the nearest inhabited system and hit the jump button. Agony ripped through her, dropping her into blackness as a scream echoed through the ship.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Consciousness oozed back into her awareness. Slowly the world around her came back into focus until she could finally read the flashing red message on the nav console. Her mind went numb as she read, "Constraint Malfunction". Then she caught sight of a second message, one she’d never seen before. It read, "Non-Standard Jump Successful - Hyperdrive Nominal". Quickly her hands flew across the terminal calling up the nav computer dump. What she saw looked like garbage. Next she tried the hyperdrive itself, expecting to see the standard five equations in five unknowns that controlled the jump field. Instead she got a list of fifteen equations in fifteen unknowns. While she was puzzling over the messages Jones launched himself into the room meowing loudly. Then he launched himself back toward the door meowing wildly all the while. It took Kara a few moments to remember Valen in engineering, instantly she was moving.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The sight of Valen convulsing at the end of her implant cable cost her a nasty thump as she forgot to correct her velocity. She moved to Valen as the convulsions lessened and reached for the cable until a weak voice stopped her. "No, hyperdrive maintenance terminal, help, please..." Then another fit of convulsions ripped through her choking off speech.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hurrying made her fingers clumsy as she finally coaxed a monitor to life and entered the commands to bring up maintenance. There, centered in the screen was a small icon with "Help Me" under it. Opening it brought up a file.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Kara - last pulse almost too much. Need reset cyberware. Go my cabin, test unit, plug in. don’t disconnect me until - using hyperdrive backup/maintain. Take breakout short electrical pins 2,3,7,8 until breathing stops, wait 20 seconds more, jump 2,3,6,7 5 seconds, watch screen. If no breathing five minute...thank you not shooting</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">To Kara it took forever to assemble the pieces. In reality it was only minutes before she was ready to make the switch. Valen’s convulsions increased when she pulled the data connection loose from the hyperdrive and slowed slightly once the circuit was reconnected. Everything went by the note until the restart. Text scrolled by until it stopped at,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"Life Support file corrupt or missing. Retry, Manual, External, Cancel?<R>"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara stared at it for a moment then tried Retry. A moment later the same message returned. Next she selected External.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"No External Life Support attached. Attach and Retry or Cancel<R>"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Canceling brought her back to the previous message where she hit Manual. Another screen walked her through heart rate, respiration, and blood pressure then brought up,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"Life Support Start Beginning"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After several moments it flashed back,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"Life Support Start Failed. Retry, Cancel<R>"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She repeatedly pushed retry and the message came back each time. A glance at the time on the monitor showed it getting closer and closer to five minutes, then five minutes, then five minutes and ten seconds. "No, I will not let you die." She stabbed the button again and watched, waiting for the dreaded "Life Support Start Failed. Retry, Cancel<R>" message. Time crawled along until Valen gave a massive shudder and began breathing. Instantly text began to scroll up the screen. Ten minutes passed before it stopped and still Valen hadn’t moved.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After five minutes more Valen stirred and mumbled, "What...Where..." then slumped back down into unconsciousness. Fear pushed Kara back to the text on the screen.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"Life support nominal.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Batteries discharged - charging suppressed until fuel cell refueled.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Fuel Cell functioning - 10% fuel remaining.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">System deep sleep active.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">System rebuild running.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">External Support may be removed now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Carefully Kara pulled Valen loose from the cables and floated her to her own quarters. Gently she placed her in the bed and fastened down the covers, holding her in place if she should toss about. Jones slid in beside her and resting a paw on her cheek began purring. Kara turned to the data station and began trying to figure out where they were.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen woke slowly to a warm touch on her cheek. Slowly opening her eyes she looked right into the face of Jones. "Hey Jones," she said quietly. Jones immediately began to purr louder. Kara turned at the sound in time to hear, "Where..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"My quarters. It was easier than settling you in yours," she replied as she moved to the bed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Did we..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, we're talking aren't we?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How long..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"A couple of hours."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, how long..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"umm," Kara hesitated.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How long, please?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Five minutes.... fifteen seconds."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh gods. You shouldn't have..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I couldn't not. Are you..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, we're talking, right?" Valen replied with a ghost of a smile. "I don't know. There are no large gaps that I notice, but I haven't been through a cold restart before, so I wouldn't know how to check."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Here..." Kara handed Valen a drink bulb full of Icicle Everclear.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks." Valen smiled as she sucked down the alcohol. "Much better."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Good! What about back-ups, wouldn't there be some in case..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, it was always assumed there'd be support units nearby. There is a backup memory unit but it runs off similar power units as the main one does." They lapsed into silence for a while until Valen asked, "Where are we?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. Something went wrong and the nav computer crashed with a constraint failure. All I can get from it are weird error messages and the hyperdrive is giving me way too many equations. So far I know we are in a place where the stars don't match any of the nav system charts. There is a source of radio signals here, although the signal encoding doesn't match anything we have. I am going to move closer to the source, you could sleep some more; it'll be several hours before we arrive. Are you ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think so. Could use some more..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thought you might," Kara replied as she pulled the bottle from her pocket and began filling the drink bulb.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen sucked down most of the bulb before settling back. "Guess I could use the sleep."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara watched for a few minutes as her eyes drifted closed then she moved to the bed and checked the covers. She watched a few minutes more then whispered softly, "Keep an eye on her Jones." Jones began to purr and moved his paw back to Valen's cheek. "She looks so much more at peace when she sleeps." Kara turned and didn't see Valen's eyes pop open in surprise then slowly drift back down.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara moved toward the bridge mentally shaking her head in amusement over the conversation. 'The Butcher, and I can almost read her mind. Too scary,' but still she smiled to herself as she went.</p>
