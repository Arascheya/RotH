<p class="regtxt5">I was on my way home from school when it started. A bright sharp fear rising rapidly to terror. I began to run, faster, faster, knowing I had to get home. In my haste I missed the pushed up piece of walkway and tripped, falling hard on my hands. I was up again and running, headless of the blood oozing from the scrapes left by rough concrete.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was almost there now, just a little further. A scream burst in my head as I shoved the door open with bloody palms. A sharp pain at my throat brought me to my knees.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Crawling, I pulled myself to the stairs and clawed my way up them. On the second floor I pulled myself up again and staggered down the hall toward my mom’s room. At the door I stopped. Blood was everywhere, leaking from the slash in her throat, pooling under her chair. A long knife lay on the floor beside her. Her sightless eyes burned into mine where I stood leaning against the doorframe.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My father came up behind me then. "She was weak, too weak to survive in this life. Forget her, you are stronger than she was, forget the weak ones and move on. Go, rest now, I’ll take care of this."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I turned to argue, to say something in her defense, but the cold calculating look in his eyes stopped me. Instead I nodded numbly and shuffled off to my room. Later I headed downstairs for something to eat. As I approached the kitchen I could hear my father’s voice. "It’s taken care of. She can no longer reveal anything. I need a cleaning call tonight though." There was a pause before he continued, "No, she won’t talk. If she does, well she can go the same as the mother."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">as currently written - her sister dies, play that up, and the effect of Sarah’s death.</p>
