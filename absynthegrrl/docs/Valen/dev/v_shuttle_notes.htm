<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Shuttle Notes - Use for Ghost Wind entry process</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The return to Earth by any spacecraft is a risky operation, although until Saturday, there had never been a fatal accident upon reentry from a space mission in the 42 years of US manned space flight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All that changed with the breakup of the Columbia space shuttle as it returned to earth Saturday after what had been a picture-perfect 16-day mission -- a disaster which underscored the perils of reentry from space.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">James Oberg, a space expert and former NASA worker who has written many books on the subject, said: "There is a lot of danger when it is coming down."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The danger starts at one hour before landing, Touchdown minus one hour:-</p>

<p class="regtxt9">With the green light from ground control, the crew manoeuvres the shuttle to slow down enough to fall out of Earth orbit. Columbia's orbit was at 280 kilometers (175 miles).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus 32 minutes 14 seconds:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The shuttle is at 122km (75 miles) altitude, travelling at 27,400km (17300miles) an hour, but is still 8,500km (5,275 miles) from its target, the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">In the "interface" period, the vessel hits the upper layers of the upper atmosphere and air friction slows the shuttle, which is dropping toward Earth at a rate of descent of nine kilometers (5.5 miles) a minute.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The shuttle must then tilt upward to present its flat bottom, covered with heat-resistant ceramic tiles, to the upper atmosphere, with the nose angled upward at 40 degrees, the so-called "angle of attack." This angle is critical to the shuttle's re-entry. If it is greater than 40 degrees, the craft could flip over backward from the atmospheric thrust. Less, and it would risk entering the atmosphere too fast, and overheating and possibly melting its aluminum shell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus 28 minutes, 42 seconds:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">At a speed of Mach 25, 25 times the speed of sound, and an altitude of 85km (52 miles), the hydraulic wing flaps, or elevons, play a key role, helping the shuttle to make a series of wide turns to further reduce the speed. The thrust rockets that until then had kept the shuttle stable are turned off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus 26 minutes, 56 seconds:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The shuttle uses its elevons to make a series of 60 degree left-to-right banking maneuvers to slow the craft without having to lift the shuttle nose, while increasing the descent rate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus 26 minutes, 4 seconds</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The shuttle is flying at Mach 19. The heat tiles on the bottom of the craft are at 1,650 degrees Celsius (3,000 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus 16 minutes:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This is the moment at which Columbia broke up Saturday, at 200,000 feet and traveling at 20,000 kilometers (12,500 miles) per hour, roughly six to seven times the speed of a rifle bullet. The craft was making a banking maneuver at 57 degrees.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus 12 minutes:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The angle of attack, at which the nose is raised, decreases to maximize the effect of the speed brake flap.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus 10 minutes, 33 seconds:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The shuttle is traveling at Mach 7.3, about 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) per hour at 140,000 feet (42,400 metres). Internal navigational systems are shut down in favor of the radio-navigation devices used in commercial jets.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus eight minutes, 44 seconds:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">At Mach 5 and 118,000 feet (35,000 metres), the craft becomes more controllable.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus three minutes 57 seconds:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">At an altitude of 46,000 feet (14,000 metres), the shuttle speed drops below the speed of sound. At this point, the pilot takes over manual control of the shuttle from the onboard computer. The pilot enters the final approach and aligns the shuttle with the desired trajectory, making a 360 degree turn. It is the last chance to alter the descent profile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus one minute, 31 seconds:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">At 15,000 feet (4,500 metres), the pilot can see the landing strip 10 kilometers (six miles) away but is moving at 510 kilometers (320 miles) an hour. The shuttle is descending at a precipitous angle of 18-20 degrees, compared with a commercial airliner's descent of about three degrees.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus 33 seconds:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">At 2,000 feet (600 metres), the shuttle brings up its nose to slow the craft from 555 kilometers (345 miles) per hour.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus 20 seconds</p>

<p class="regtxt9">At 300 feet (100 metres), the landing gear drops.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus 10 seconds</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The shuttle is over the start of the runway.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">T minus 0:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The shuttle touches down. A parachute is deployed with the shuttle moving at 350 kilometers (215 miles) per hour. Brakes are applied and the shuttle comes to a stop generally within 10,000 feet (3,000 metres).</p>
