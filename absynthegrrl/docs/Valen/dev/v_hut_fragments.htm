<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Hut Fragments</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* transfer to the Hut */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen looked up startled as somewhere in the distance she heard a deep chorus of chimes. The air shimmered and wavered as blackness pressed in.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The woman looked at the three figures slumped against the walls. With a sad smile she moved to one of them, bent down, and retrieved an ornate dagger. Carefully she fitted a clear gem into the top of it where the horns from the carved demon face came together. Placing it gently on the floor she moved back to the owner of the dagger and dragged her to the center of the worn intricately patterned rug. She lay down, picked up the dagger and wrapped the unconscious woman’s hands around it. She drew a deep breath and pulled the dagger into her chest.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen’s eyes snapped open as the dagger point touched the woman’s chest. Immediately she pulled against the pressure, halting the dagger’s travel. Long moments hung in the balance as the two struggled.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Krys woke with the trace of chimes still ringing in her ears. Her head snapped up in time to see a frozen tableau in the center of the room. Valen was crouched over a prone woman and was struggling with her. A faint shadow of a gaunt, tall woman dressed in white floated behind Valen’s right shoulder.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Let go, Great Mother. You must let it end." The prone woman spoke to Valen. For a moment Valen’s grip faltered. It was enough. With an audible sigh the dagger slid home. A pulsing red vapor flowed into the clear gem as Valen stared in horror.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A soft voice echoed faintly in her head as life fled the woman below her. "Thank you Mother. I return to you." A flurry of images and thoughts cascaded into Valen’s mind, swirling and twisting through her mind in a mad dance.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A ghostly hand touched her shoulder briefly, just long enough for symbols to form in her head. Meaning followed quickly, "Visit me in the Halls of Pain in the City of Doors, my friend."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A gong split the air as it shimmered and turned white-hot. As darkness claimed Krys again she saw the walls of the chamber shimmer and buckle showing huge gaps of absolute blackness, the same blackness that claimed her.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Krys struggled back to consciousness to find Valen slumped over the dead woman. Soul Eater protruded obscenely from the woman’s chest, the gem still pulsing with an evil reddish light.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi stirred as Krys moved towards Valen. "Krys, what happened? Where we?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Don’t know yet." She bent over the prone form, "Valen, Valen, are you alright?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen moaned softly, then shook her head trying to clear it. "I’m not sure." When she saw the body she paled, "So it wasn’t a dream." Her hands moved before her consciousness caught up. By themselves they pulled the dead woman’s right hand open and pulled out an elaborate object. As soon as it was clear of the body’s hand the body disintegrated, leaving only a fine grey powder where it had been. Soul Eater thumped to the carpet and the gem popped free.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Within seconds of touching the item, the Key as it quickly revealed itself to be, images and data poured through her in a river of sensation. Rich reds and greens of the energies flowing through the systems and processors, vibrant blues and purples of magical energy that sustained the shell and interfaces, the pulses of herself, Shandi, and Krys in the room with her, another elsewhere, plus myriads of tiny sparks that shifted and ebbed through the Hut itself, part of the maintenance and cleaning functions. Her vision expanded to see through the now clear walls of the Hut and beheld a picket fence of skulls and bones surrounding an emerald patch of grass. Data screens floated where she could quickly scan them to find the Hut set in maximum defensive mode with repair systems working frantically on the hyperdrive engine that formed the beating heart of it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">More images cascaded through Valen’s mind. These were more like the data from Ghost Wind when she would plug her implant directly into the ship. Wire frame models, statistics, and other data flashed through her awareness. It ended with a small display of "Transfer of control complete. Awaiting your desires mistress." Her thoughts turned inward as she analyzed this latest information. Moments later the voice sounded again, "Interface is visible at unknown location. Engage stealth and full defcon?" she sorted through the data pouring into her head until she figured out what the voice was asking. Accepting the recommendations she returned to scanning through the system.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly Krys and Shandi surveyed their surroundings. They were clustered on an ornate oriental style rug, placed in the center of the room. The room itself was a fifteen foot diameter hexagon lit by a warm pool of light from the ceiling above them. Directly overhead was a one foot diameter dish of clear crystal with purple swirls dancing in it. The walls were paneled in teak. One wall contained an oak door. On the wall opposite of the door was a six foot square view screen displaying,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"Jump System off-line</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Control system damage</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Auto repair running"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Long moments passed as Krys looked on. Finally she spoke again, "Valen, are you in there? What’s happening?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen looked up as though from a great distance. Slowly her eyes focused on Krys and Shandi crouching next to her. "What?" a moment passed, "I’ll try and find out." Her eyes glazed back over as she plunged back into the data stream dancing in her head. Slowly and carefully she announced, "We are in a thing of magic and technology. It exists in some type of special anomaly that maybe Lynn could understand. We are in the control center and it looks like we are the only ones here. No, wait. There is a fourth in the library. I’m going to try and display this on the screen for you." A complicated image of separated rooms appeared on the view screen in place of the text. A small green dot appeared in one of the smaller rooms. "We are where the dot is." A red dot appeared in a much larger room. "If I am understanding this thing the other life is the ‘librarian’ and is in the library. Maybe we should go there. I think I can find the way from what I’ve seen."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* valen - disconnect from the Hut - determine if this happens when leaving the Hut or under more extreme circumstances */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Issuing the command to separate brought intense sadness. Her senses contracted back into a dark little world of narrow vision and muddied hearing. The walls of the room closed around her and she felt only the sensations of her own body. Shaking it off she rose and moved toward the door.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The idea here is something akin to controlling a shadow ship - expanded sensory input and abilities while fully linked. She can access the Hut systems from a great distance, but must remove herself from the control matrix on exit of the structure because of the shielding and defensive systems of the Hut.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* after reading Margla's diary */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What? This is crazy, there's no way I can be this "great mother" she's talking about. I never even had any children."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* in Centrys */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She Who Must Not Be Named, She..., will awaken Valen and give her an item from Margla. The item will include several more destinations for the Hut NavSys. These are:</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Akhalt - edge of the city of Akhalt</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Gardens - edge of the Gardens of Lazaar</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Skelos - ruins of the magic school of Skelos about half a day from Shadizar</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She will also tell Valen that Margla held a small realm on the Plane of Concordant Opposition.</p>
