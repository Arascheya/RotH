<p class="pagecaption">Farni and Amanda - Images</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Amanda sitting on the couch sketching Farni. Farni sitting on the floor sewing a long skirt for an upcoming craft fair. Amanda remembering when they met. Farni glances up, smiles, and mimes a kiss, then a playful flick of her tongue, a promise of later things...It suddenly strikes Amanda that it has been eight years since they met and for all that time they still are playing like they're casual lovers. It's more teasing now, but Amanda will sometimes ask Farni in the morning if she still needs a place to stay that night. Farni still will sometimes say she aught to get her own place, she wouldn't want to impose...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Amanda in her office, Farni entering looking for work. Discouraged from fifteen interviews in as many days, most just a hi, a look at her resume, and references, then a thank you, we'll call you if we need you. Surprised that Amanda is a woman. Amanda remembers the rumors of scandal surrounding Farni's family and mentions it, looking for reaction. Is pleased to figure Farni was the one. They talk about many things, but not like a regular interview. She tells Farni to start next week. Amanda gets flash of lust, Farni also.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Farni arrives back home to yet another fight with her current roommate/lover. Weekend turns into one long hassle, leaving her exhausted by beginning of week. Comes in pale and haggard under her bronze skin. Amanda immediately notices. When Farni is reluctant to leave that evening Amanda invites her to dinner. Then offers her a place to crash for the evening after hearing about the problems at home. They end up making love and Farni starts staying with Amanda. There is no real decision to form a relationship, it just develops as they go along, one day leading into the next, growing together without really consciously trying to make it work. Room-mate’s lover keeps hitting on her whenever he comes over. Room-mate has bought into world view of females as little more than property. She has trouble with Farni’s willingness to fight back and stand up for herself.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Farni and Servalan together at some time in the future. Together after Amanda’s death, in bed early morning. Farni smiling rolls to Servalan and says, "You should know I still hate you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Servalan smiles back, "Could you please hate me again?"</p>
