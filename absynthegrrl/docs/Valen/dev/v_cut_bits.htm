<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Cut Scenes</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">begining section of chapter one</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Notes: seemed to drag, sucked in better if started outside the port, can use for flashbacks and background data */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It started like most any other day at the government building. There were a few more protesters and groups of people hanging around the entries, but not enough to seem out of the ordinary. As Valen finished her meeting with Director of Space Fleet Donnegan a security detail arrived at the door. The sergeant tactfully waited until Valen had finished then quietly broke in with, "I don’t think there is any need for alarm, Premiere Valen, but we felt you might be safer with an escort this morning. There are a few more protesters than usual and things are getting strained near the entryways."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Security tended toward paranoia, but then that’s what they were paid for. With a shrug she fell in and let them begin threading her down the hall. As they moved deeper into the government complex nervousness began to inch its way up her back. Part of it was the lack of glancing around the guards did. They seemed more intent on escorting her through the complex rather than watching for danger around them.  As they neared her office she spoke to the leader, "Excuse me sergeant, I need to stop by my office for a moment."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don’t think that would be a good idea, Premiere. It would be better if we got you to the meeting chamber. That way we could concentrate our efforts on keeping everyone safe." Brief panic surged through her as parts of her that had remained dormant for years suddenly woke and screamed 'DANGER!' She began scanning her surroundings while remaining blank faced as they moved closer to her office. Adrenaline coursed through her as she realized she’d only have one chance. Everything would have to be timed to the instant.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She let out a blood-curdling scream as she dove between two of the guards. Her right shoulder slammed into the weapon arm of the rear guard as her left hand stabbed the open door button of her office. A diving roll propelled her into the room as she yelled "Lock" on the way by. Fear of blaster fire kept her curled tight on the floor as she wondered if the security protocols had been changed on her door. Finally it hissed shut and clicked as the security locks engaged.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Quickly she rose and moved to the terminal on the desk. She snapped her head back and engaged the two data links hidden in the upholstery of the chair. Instantly the building schematics painted themselves across her awareness. Various sections showed red, including the security offices. A small flashing display at the edge of the image called her attention, expanding as she focused on it. "Intruder Hack in Progress - Security System".</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her awareness switched to the security section of the building. The few still functional cameras revealed expanding chaos. Several bodies were scattered about the office and three figures were huddled around the master console. Another two were pulling covers off the system processors. Awareness flicked to the security comm channels just in time to hear the guard leader report her escape. She froze for long moments as her assistant’s voice answered, "Contain her, then get your men down here for personal locator screening suits. I’m sending reinforcements. Whatever you do keep your talking to a minimum, she’ll be listening to everything we say."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes Great One, hearing is obedience."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Flicking her awareness back to the camera systems she rapidly scanned the building. The main exits showed groupings of security guards facing into the building, weapons at the ready. Several other cameras showed building personnel being marched along by security details. All of them looked similar to the group that had escorted her. The people were tense and worried, glancing everywhere and trying to figure out what was happening. The guards stared stiffly and marched mechanically onward. The camera just outside her office showed two guards watching her door and a couple others watching the rest of the corridor. Another view revealed two more guards at the private entrance to her office.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her safety would be temporary at best. It wouldn’t take long for a team to assemble with equipment to cut through her door. She scanned her office for potential weapons. Noting the decanter and glasses on the side table, the terminal assembly on her desk, the heavy drawers, made of expensive solid wood from Descartes, her chair and plain metal refuse depository. Any of them would take down one or two people, but none would get her out of the building.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly her assistant’s voice called from the comm, "Valen, I know you can hear me. Give yourself up now and we won’t hurt you. We only want to introduce you to the glories of one mind. If we have to cut you out, you might be slightly worse for wear."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Quickly she scanned the room once more, looking for something she might have missed. Her eyes flicked across the ornamental screen panels standing in front of the small closet and washroom and back to the private entrance. Its hallway wasn’t monitored, only the doors at each end. While she was inside it her personal locator would not be visible on building security, but once she reached the other end it would re-appear. She started to rise and move to it until she glanced up and saw the ceiling access panel above the washroom door. It had been designed to keep others out, not keep her in. A quick thought was enough to call up the building plans. It took a few precious moments to find the ones dealing with her office. A small hiss of frustration escaped her as she found it led only to the section of ceiling above her office. All the ducts and other connections had been kept small enough to prevent unwanted access.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her eyes flicked once more to the private entrance, bringing a grim smile, as she knew what she had to do. Gently she rose from her chair, moving slowly so not to disturb the data links. She reached over and hit the door open then she reached inside herself, searching for the abilities she hadn’t used in years. Slowly, like thick syrup pouring from a cold container it rose within her. Patterns of electric current flow shimmered into visibility within her awareness. First came the soothing ebbs and flows in her implant, then the screaming colors of the room lighting and security, followed rapidly by the riot that was the terminal on her desk. It was the one she kept for show. Finally the faint glow of her personal locator appeared in the pattern. She returned to her chair and sat back down while narrowing her focus to that one small pattern. Slowly she narrowed her focus even tighter until at last she could see the trails of energy from its power cell. It took longer than she would have thought to bend those currents through the regulator along the wrong path, and hold them there until the unit destroyed itself. Sweat dripped down her face as she let out a sigh and waited. It didn’t take long until her assistant’s voice sounded on the comm, "She’s in her private tunnel. Get her!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She waited until the locator blips of the guards moved away from her door then she rose from her chair. Reaching back she pulled the data links out of the connections at the base of her skull. Rather than letting them retract into their holders, she pulled them sharply to her. The break-aways in the chair let go, leaving her holding two three meter long optical/electrical cables and the spooling mechanisms that held them. Her hands coiled them and stuffed them inside her tunic as she grabbed the dagger out of her boot and moved to the main door. This time it was almost as easy as it had been in the past to reroute the security signals and open the door without triggering the alarms. She slipped into the hall and headed deeper into the building, past more offices and then down toward the basement storage areas. A narrow side hall brought her to the access door she was after. Within moments she had it open and was across the room and opening the door to the maintenance tunnels.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her hand froze in the action of reaching for the light switch at the sound of thumping and banging from further down the tunnel. Quickly she slipped all the way onto the narrow platform at the top of stairs plunging down into darkness. Silently she cursed herself for wearing hard soled shoes that morning. As quietly as she could she hurried down the stairs. Just as she reached the bottom light exploded in her eyes. Unused muscles screamed as she dropped into a fighter’s crouch. A quick flick of her wrist and her knife flew toward the first blur as a diving lunge launched her after it. Fire leapt across her left shoulder as a pipe on the wall exploded, spraying steam and metal fragments, from the blaster bolt that hit it. Instantly the tunnel was plunged into blackness once more. Long unused circuits in her implant screamed into action, cutting the pain to an advisory level from a crippling one. Data painted itself into her awareness pinpointing the locations of damage and its extent. She hit her target in the stomach, driving it back into the person behind and bringing them all down in a tangle amidst pipes and cable trays. Rolling and grappling she found her knife in her first attacker’s shoulder. A quick tug brought it out and across his throat as the second person thumped her hard on her burned shoulder with a blaster butt. She barely felt it as more damage appeared on the status displays. Ignoring it she grabbled for her other attacker, managing to get a handful of cloth. Pulling as hard as she could, she was rewarded with a crash and thump as her assailant went down. She scrambled to gain advantage before the other one could get up. Quick movement brought her knife across the second throat before she realized her target wasn’t moving.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Groping in the dark she found a hand light on one of the bodies. Switching it on she saw two bodies in security uniforms and blood everywhere. A quick scan of the area revealed one blaster still in working condition. As her adrenaline rush receded she felt the burning in her chest and muscles from the unexpected use. She thought of resting a few moments until the hissing steam behind her reminded her of the damaged pipe. As quickly as she could she began moving along the tunnel.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The cut-outs kept the pain from registering but she could watch the effects registering on the displays. Her body was beginning to overheat as she arrived at the first junction in the tunnels. Ahead was the security and safety building, to the left was the court building, and down one level and sort of to the right was the physical plant building serving the complex.  She was about to start down to the lower level when the squawk of a radio halted her. "The steam should be off by the time you reach the leak. Report back as soon as you find out what happened." Quickly she staggered down the corridor toward the court building and crouched down behind a tangle of piping. She balanced her blaster on a pipe and trained it at the top of the stairwell. One by one six people moved across her line of fire. Three wore the faded, stained grey coveralls of maintenance while the others wore security fatigues. The lead security officer was waving a heat sensing scanner in front of her and muttering about the too much heat in the tunnels.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Unbidden thoughts of her assistant swept through her mind as she crouched, waiting. "Betrayed, he betrayed me...why??" Tearing her thoughts away from her betrayal she focused on the immediate task of escape. The physical plant at first seemed the best option until she realized it would be the most carefully watched. The court building wouldn’t be much better. That left the security building. It would be walking into the heart of danger, but few would probably expect her to go that way.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She waited until she could no longer hear the maintenance team moving before easing herself to her feet and toward the security complex. Heat and the blood leaking from her shoulder continued to leach her strength. Most of her concentration was focused on moving so she almost didn’t pay attention when a motion sensor pattern flashed across her mind. Just before she stepped into its field something tickled her consciousness and she froze. When she really looked, she saw it’s webbing stretched across the tunnel in front of her. Concentrating on keeping the sensor not triggered left her only enough strength to slowly crawl across the stretch of tunnel it blanketed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A short walk farther and she was in the maintenance levels of the security building. She reached for the door into the lowest halls then stopped. She scanned the room, looking for a maintenance terminal anywhere amongst the equipment. A battered old one was tucked back into a far corner. Tracing the cabling back she found the data jack under the table. Moments later she was in the system and firing off her private access utilities. The net blossomed once more in her mind. Tracking through the myriad processes she eased her way to the dispatch zones and began monitoring them. Once she had a feel for where the most activity was happening she planned her next moves. A couple of altered commands cleared the locker room. An altered alarm routed most of the vehicles waiting in the garage to the main entrance of the building she had just left. Last of all she called up building plans and traced her route out. Then she launched utilities to encrypt all her personal data stores and erase the common links to them. Next came the compression routines to slam as much into her implant as it could hold and move backups of it through the net to the Icicle repository system. The final utility activated an explosive disconnect on the Icicle data line. The data was now safely cut loose from the net, assuming she could ever get to it. She stood, disconnected the cables and moved carefully toward the door.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At the door she snapped off the light and waited, listening for activity in the hallway on the other side. A quick turn of the knob and she slipped into the hallway. To the right and one level up was detention and interrogation. Off to the left were the solitary cells. Two levels up were the main and overflow locker rooms. She figured the overflow locker rooms would probably give her the best chance. Someone should have left a spare uniform or street clothes that would fit her well enough to get her out of the building without notice.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A quick dash brought her to the base of the stairs. A rapid glance showed them to be empty. Knife in hand once more she padded up the stairs. Just as she started to slide around the edge of the landing a door opened and a muffled clamor of voices floated from the main locker room. Footsteps headed toward the stairs, forcing her to dash quickly back down them to the first landing. She waited until their footsteps receded up the stairs and then ran back up. At the top she waited a few moments for her breathing and heart rate to calm down, vowing to herself to start working out again if she survived. Another quick dash brought her to her destination. Light spilled from behind the door as she started to open it. She was about to close it and move on when the door to the main locker room opened again, forcing her to dart into the room in front of her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A startled face greeted her entrance. "Say nothing and you live," she hissed. His confusion bought her enough time to begin her leap before he dove for his weapons belt. Her knife handle arrived at the back of his head just before his fingers reached his belt. The satisfying thump was followed by his collapse into oblivion. Working quickly she secured him with his secondary restraints, gagged him with his own socks, and dragged him into one of the toilet stalls.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She searched the lockers for something to change into. There were only two choices in her size, a worn Tactical Team coverall and a set of street clothes. For a moment she considered the coverall then rejected it. In the confusion everyone would be watching his or her partners closely. Stripping off her bloodied and torn clothes she sipped into the street garb.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was a short walk from the locker area to one of the side doors. It took only a couple of moments to bypass the alarm and ident system and slip out to the ground transport area. Fumbling in the pockets she finally found a code key for one. Fortune smiled as it came out attached to a locator trigger. A quick press of the button revealed the vehicle she wanted. She sat for long moments to let her tired body recover as much as it could before engaging the drive system and heading toward the gate.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It wasn’t hard for her to present a bone-weary appearance at the gate as she mutely handed her stolen ident card to the guard on duty. He seemed determined to start a conversation, beginning with, "Long shift huh?" Valen nodded. "Did you get hooked into all the shit next door?" She nodded again. "What’s going on anyway?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Stuck, she croaked out, in her best hoarse voice, "I’m not sure. All they told us was crowd control and to prepare for possible riots. I’ve yelled myself hoarse trying to deal with the crowds. All I want now is a stiff drink. See you in the morning." He was starting to look a bit puzzled as she eased the vehicle forward. She heard the comm beep just as he opened the gate. She drove through as fast as she could without triggering more suspicion. She was waiting for him to shout and begin firing, but it didn’t happen.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">A few blocks later she pulled over to a public comm. unit and called her estate. "Albert it looks like I have an unexpected dinner engagement in town. Please don’t tap a new bottle of my favorite wine for tonight. You can tell everyone to take the night off."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Understood mistress. What should we do if there are some of the usual drop-by guests tonight?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was pretty open as far as code went, but it did tell her that there were already people at her estate. That way was closed. "Serve them whatever you can find. I wouldn’t make everyone wait there with you. I’m sorry I can’t be there."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It’s ok. I’m sure we can make do." She closed the call, returned to the vehicle and began making her way to the spaceport.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">/* chapter one - during escape from Centralys */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"They really are after you." They had just cleared atmosphere where they saw two medium cruisers closing in on them. "I hope you know how to fly, I’m going to try and discourage them a bit."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What?!!? Shit!" Valen shouted as she glanced back seeing her open another hidden panel and climb a short ladder. A warning bar appeared on the engine monitors, 'High energy drain - system loading 95% design spec.' She could hear the whining of charging weapons even over all the other noises. The discharge pulse dimmed the lights and flickered the monitors.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">/* msuings on Kara */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Trying to distract herself, she turned her thoughts to Kara and the Eritsani. She realized she knew very little about them. They were wanderers and favored ship based work. Many of them had formed the first family ships. There were sensationalized stories about them sacrificing their children first in desperate times, but she’d never actually heard of an instance herself, just the widespread stories that were told.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">/* about the Razaks as they are near Terristra */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It’s hidden, there aren’t many trails to it, but there’s stuff in the government systems that’ll point to it sooner or later. We’ve got to go NOW! Come on. Call in and let’s get out of here!!</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">/* removed from sequence about customs at Tayis */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* was */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Five minutes later the comm beeped and a voice said, "Ghost Wind, this is Teyis customs. Cargo locks are in place. You may proceed to customs and immigration at your convenience. Thank you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That’s it? It’s that simple? No ident verification? No in-depth inspections, just the seals are on your cargo doors, please check in at the customs station on your way by??"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Many of the Core Systems are pretty lax if cargo isn’t involved or if the last port was also in the Core Systems. Don’t you remember? It was one of your programs to encourage trade and traffic." Valen followed Kara to the crew airlock and out. It was very different from the facilities she was used to as Premier. The tube ended at a junction of several others where faded letters and arrows detailed the bay number and directions to the rest of the station. Everything was worn and faded, showing signs of age and hard use, not the clean newness of the areas she had become used to seeing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* removed */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That’s it? It’s that simple? No ident verification? No in-depth inspections, just the seals are on your cargo doors, please check in at the customs station on your way by??"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Many of the Core Systems are pretty lax if cargo isn’t involved or if the last port was also in the Core Systems. Don’t you remember? It was one of your programs to encourage trade and traffic."</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">/* removed nightmare sequence - doesn’t really fit anyway */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* it went in chapter 2 between the galley talk and emerging near Karanal */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Things improved slightly after the talk in the galley, but Valen still couldn’t bring herself to talk about the nightmares that were visiting her every night, some nights only once, some nights every time her eyes would close it’d play itself out. The worst one always began with her running down a corridor, trying to reach a pressure hatch while something terrible was chasing her. She would round a bend and see the hatch in the distance, beckoning, promising safety. Fear and hope would prompt her into a faster sprint, then, just as she could almost reach it a blow or bolt would slam into her back and she’d go down, only feet from the hatch. As pain shoved her into blackness whatever had struck her would start rolling her over and she would wake, the scream still clawing at her throat. The last time it had happened she thought she recognized the area beyond the hatch. It was the airlock at the cargo bays.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">That morning she prowled down to that section of the ship and went over the airlock extremely carefully. There were signs of repair and painting. It looked as if an entire section of the lock had been rebuilt. When she asked Kara if Ghost Wind had ever been fitted as a passenger ship she said Ghost Wind had been designed to convert between cargo and passengers by slipping low cost berth modules into the cargo bay and coupling them to the ship systems. Kara didn’t like hauling passengers so she never used that feature. She had looked very puzzled and asked why Valen wanted to know. Valen tried to pass it off as just curiosity, but wasn’t sure if she had. There had been a decided edge to Kara’s questioning.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">/* removed from chapter 4 near the end */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Without thinking Kara wrapped her in a gentle hug, "Thank the goddess! That was way too close. Are you ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don’t know, massive headache. Everything is still settling down in here." Her voice was faint and strained, but steady. She closed her eyes for several minutes while Kara watched in silence. "Are you ok? Did we make it out?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We did..." Kara replied hesitantly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But?" Valen’s eyes opened and looked up at Kara.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well the nav system reported a constraint fault. Obviously it didn’t kill us but I have no idea where we are. The weird part is the hyperdrive didn’t complain. What’s even more strange the nav system dump was garbage, yet the hyperdrive didn’t give me the standard five equations but fifteen."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Standard five?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Normally there are five equations that define the way the hyperdrive system pops us into hyperspace. Fifteen equations are closer to the dimension set the theoretical types say make up the known universe. Much more than that you’d have to ask one of them."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wait a minute - this is a YD2000 drive isn’t it? Military surplus you said? What is its serial number?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don’t know, let me check. Why?" Kara moved to the nameplate on her drive and stared at it. "That’s funny, I could have sworn there was a serial number on it. Lynn always knows what it needs."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Wait, what am I asking..." Valen fell silent for a moment while she queried the drive controller. "This seems really complex. Did you get this one at a good price?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, Lynn said the military was dumping some units that were a little different. She didn’t go into details but she assured me it worked just fine. It has too... What are you saying here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’m not sure yet." She focused back into the drive controller and probed at its interface and command structures. After several minutes while Kara looked on impatiently she returned to the room. "This is a really involved unit. It seems like everything about the control system is set by software. Is this normal for hyperdrives?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No. The interface is supposed to be very simple and fool-proof. The nav computer sends the five equations into the drive and the drive makes the jump. Everything else is supposed to be hard-coded into the drive controller. Why?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Space Fleet purchased several modified low serial number drives from YD just before I became Premiere. They were doing research into alternate dimension translations. The thought was by using different sets of transfer equations the ships would be harder to track. The results were all bad. They gave up after the third cruiser was lost. The rest of the units were supposed to be destroyed, but I think some of them were sold as surplus by accident."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Looks like they missed one. I feel so special. No wonder the price was so good." Kara’s voice dripped sarcasm.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No wait, this really is good thing. What if we were using a standard drive and this had happened? Even if we figured out where we were we wouldn’t be able to change anything on the drive to help us get back."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We need to figure out where we are. Can you move?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen carefully pulled the link from her neck and gently tried to move. What she thought was a gentle push spun her across the room. "It looks like very slowly. I think some of my coordination presets are gone." Carefully she tried again, this time bumping gently into a different section of the wall. "This is going to take time. I need to re-learn movement."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara eased herself closer. "I can help you for now. What will you need for the learning?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Time mostly, although if we could put the gravity back on I can run through some of the exercises they taught me when I was first fitted with the cyberware. Let’s find out where we are first though."</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">/* misc bits and the original beginnings of chapter 5 */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"at peace when asleep hmmm..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It took longer than she had expected. After ten hours of careful navigation and scanning she finally placed Ghost Wind in high orbit around the source of the radio signals.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly Kara eased Valen back to the bridge, settled her into a chair and carefully strapped her in. A moment later Jones gently glided into her lap and settled down. Absently Valen scratched his ears as she faded into half sleep, restoring what she could from the implant’s default settings.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara settled into the pilot’s chair and set the com receiver to scan for channels then she went to work with the scanners. The scanners revealed a blue-green planet with a large percentage of water. Radio transmissions were crude with analog data encoding. Nowhere could Kara find a locator beacon or other sign of a space aware culture.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen sat motionlessly watching the implant run diagnostics on itself. Just as she was about to open her eyes a pulse flashed across her awareness. Her eyes flew open with a startled, "What the..."</p>
