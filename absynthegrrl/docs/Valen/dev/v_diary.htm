<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Diary</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Version 1</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I have just finished reading Sara’s diary. She wrote in it to help her work through things, like plans and dreams, and such. Maybe it is worth a try, although it didn’t help her much in the end. I expect my efforts will bear little resemblance to hers. She grew up in a protected household, the daughter of two high level engineers at one of the PsyTech research facilities. I grew up in a poor household. My family were all ‘Data Acquisitions Experts’, a fancy name for data thieves.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My sister was the best, until she was killed on one of father’s nastier jobs. He rushed her when she was working on a security lid on a data cable junction box. It had a self contained detonator and trigger system, unlike the older ones that relied on external power for detonation. Now I have to fill her place. Father is mostly a screw-up, he gets low level jobs, but he doesn’t have the skills to actually get the data. My brother is good as muscle, and my mom died when he was born. I miss her. She and my sister were kind to me. Father just expected me to earn my keep. Sara’s dreams were of a career, a family, a lover, and a nice place to live. Mine have been of code, equipment, and on bad nights, of my father beating me.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Well that won’t be happening again.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I’ll try and remember this from the start – it might be more clear to me that way.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was born on Icicle, just before my father lost his job with the company there. He was supposed to be the safety foreman at the area 3 drilling site. Most days he was there, but so deep in his bottle that a volcano could have erupted under him and he wouldn’t have noticed. We stayed a few a couple more years, then my brother was born, and mom died while having him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We moved to Aristaleez as part of one of father’s jobs. He messed it up, an increasing pattern of his. This left us stranded there. He managed a few small jobs and was able to buy a place for us to live. Up until then he hadn’t been as rough on us. As his frustrations grew, so did his tendency to hit us when things went wrong. My sister got the worst of it until her death. Then I did. Andras, my brother was almost pampered, although all he could do was watch for guards or hit someone over the head on the jobs.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Things really started changing early this summer. Father had finally convinced the Chernikovs to let him do a job for them. If it went well it would guarantee him more work for them. This was to be a simple job of switching a few paper records at the office of a small tech firm. Father had me working and re-working the hack on the security system. When Andras and he left to case the job I slipped out and headed to my favorite place on the river. It was inside the perimeter fence of Aristaleez Polytechnic University. We locals are encouraged to stay off the campus unless we are gainfully employed as part of the university. I had found there was a great little patch of grass by the river about a five minute walk past the fence.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was anticipating settling in there for a while, probably until the River Rat gambling tour returned at 1500 hours. That was when I first met Sara. She was sprawled out on my grass, on my favorite spot, watching the river.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I sent him to prison. He and my brother. It was easy really. Since I was the security part of the team it was easy to turn the security back on at the wrong time and trap them in a compromising place.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was feeling pretty good for a change until I found Sarah. She had been stabbed to death and left at our favorite place on the river. She was able to tell me who did it, but I couldn’t get help in time. Something snapped in my mind. I swapped id with her and made it look like I was the one killed instead of her. I can’t even say right now why I did it. I don’t even know. Maybe I wanted a better shot. It feels like I betrayed her though.</p>
