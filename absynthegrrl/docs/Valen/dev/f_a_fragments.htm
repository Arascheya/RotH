<p class="pagecaption">Farni and Amanda - Story Fragments</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I found myself outside the Finance and Trade building on yet another interview. This was the fifteenth in as many days. If I didn't find something soon I would have to resort to the oldest profession to pay this month's rent. Gathering the last scraps of my worn dignity I pushed through the door and hurried across the lobby. I was to see an A. Moore-Clark for the position of personal assistant. If my luck held, he'd glance my way, read the black flag on my references, and dismiss me out of hand.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Already imagining the worst, I took a deep breath and opened the office door. For an instant I faltered, stunned by what I saw. She was so pretty as her face lit up with a warm smile. She ushered me to a comfortable chair and took another nearby. "Hi, I'm Amanda Moore-Clark, and you must be Farni Cauliff. I'm pleased to meet you." I started my prepared introduction only to have her stop me. "I already know you're looking for work, so tell me why here, why not somewhere else?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">What could I say? Admit desperation and hope for sympathy? As I was debating my answer she suddenly stared a moment, "Farni Cauliff, now I know what's been troubling me, you're the one that took on Jaxson and Deville Co with the discrimination/sexual harassment lawsuit."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">//Oh shit, so much for here// Face burning I couldn't meet her gaze. "From what I hear it really shook them up, it was wonderful, more women need to take your stand!" She waited patiently as I tried to sort through my confusion. "I'm still waiting for an answer..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Um...in all honesty, desperation. I've already tried everywhere else that had adds out and I saw yours today. I'm good at what I do..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "I know that part, I remember you from the women in business seminars I used to give." She looked thoughtful, then continued, "I'll get shit for this, but I'll take you. You start next week, be on time or early, I hate to be kept waiting." Her smile took the sting off the warning.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5"> I was walking on air until I arrived back at the apartment where I lived. As soon as I opened the door it started. "Well, little miss celebrity is back. Does anybody want the hicksville bimbette yet?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "Give it a rest Christie. Just because I don't want to whore myself to some man, like you have, doesn't mean you have to ride me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "Look, you either have your share of rent to me by the middle of next week or you can whore yourself on the streets for all I care. I know plenty of real men that'd be happy to take you in. If you hadn't taken on
Jaxson and Deville with that ridiculous harassment suit you'd still be working. I know it's hard for you to imagine, but the men are still in charge around this place. Oh well, stupid dykes like you deserve what they get."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I have a job so you'll get your money."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, well, I'm impressed," the sarcasm rolled off her tongue. "So, what did you have to promise him to let you work? Three nights a week?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Fed up, I stalked to my room, slamming the door as I entered. The entire weekend passed that way, including wild, raucous music to way late at night, and constant insults from Christie and her boyfriend, every time I was in communal areas.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> Monday found me exhausted and headachy. I tried to cover as much as I could with my limited makeup skills, but it still must have shown. Amanda commented shortly after my arrival, "You look pretty ragged today. Rough weekend?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "Not enough sleep. What are my duties?" I didn't want to get into an explanation of my homelife right then. She gave me a piecing look, but allowed the subject change. She ran me all over the building, explaining procedures, protocols, and duties. Lunch was eaten on the run between a couple of high level meetings. I was immediately shoved headlong into her hectic schedule. Quitting time came quicker than I would have imagined possible.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well, that was certainly a day. What do you say to a quiet dinner? I usually like to talk to my new assistants in a more relaxed manner after their first day."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The thought of returning to the apartment knotted my stomach, so I quickly agreed. She took me to one of the high class restaurants near the business district and soon we were sipping wine and waiting for our meals. The time passed in social chit chat until we were most of the way through the main course. Then she started, "It must be hard living where you don't get much sleep."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It usually isn't that bad. My roommate just got a new boyfriend and I don't think he likes sharing the apartment or ... um, with anyone else."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Are you going to have better luck tonight?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "I think so...SHIT, I forgot to ask for an advance, they're on me constantly for next month's rent. It's due by the end of the week. Could we set that up tomorrow, please?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, no problem. You know, I'm not really ready to head home yet. Would you like to accompany me a bit longer? No problems if you don't." It didn't take a moment to agree. "Anything in particular you'd like to do?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You choose, just something somewhat quiet. I'm still tired from no sleep."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know this great dance place. We could sit, talk, dance a little if we want..." She must have seen my dubious look. "It's ok, it really is a nice quiet place. If you don't like it we can always go somewhere else."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After a few minutes we pulled up to an ornate door, set into a large building downtown. I glanced sharply her way when I recognized it as the 'Cat's Meow', the hottest women's bar in town. She must have caught my glace as she replied, "We can go somewhere else..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "No, this is fine." I replied with a smile.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I hope you like it. It's one of my favorite places." We stepped inside and were immediately shown to a table near the dance floor. Most of the staff seemed to recognize her and asked how she was doing. A few of them remembered me from the few times I'd come here when Christie and I had been together. Soon we had drinks and were relaxing to the soothing yet energetic music that was a staple of the place. We talked a bit about the world situation, and other things, just to remind ourselves we were still awake. Then I glanced her way just as she looked mine. "Want to dance?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "I'd love to!" It took us a few minutes of fumbling before we matched each other's movements, then we danced three songs in a row, medium, fast, and slow. By the end of the slow dance I knew we'd go home together. Part of my mind was screaming about the trouble this could be. I'd never thought I'd dream of sleeping with the boss, but I knew I wanted to go home with this woman, more than any other I'd met. Giddy with excitement and more wine than I usually drank, I lifted her hand to mine and gently kissed her palm.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We both started to speak at once, so I let her finish, "Would you like to come home with me?" When she saw my happy nod, she linked her arm with mine and we headed for the door. We held hands like teenagers for the drive to her place. Still dizzy with excitement we ran to her apartment and hurried through the door. Our first kiss was the gentle touch of two flowers brushing in a soft breeze. Our second kiss was the insatiable hunger of two predators, seeking to devour each other.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5"> I awoke groggily to a strange alarm. Moments later warm arms surrounded me as a soft voice greeted me, "Morning gorgeous. Did you sleep well?" I managed a fuzzy smile in reply. "I'll start coffee if you want a shower."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I had managed to find my bag, dig out a brush, and was trying to drag it through my hair when hands pulled it away from me and began brushing it for me. She was finished much to soon and when I tried to tell her she just answered, "Greedy one. We don't have time this morning. You'll just have to come back tonight."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Quick showers, fruit, and coffee and we were out the door headed to work. As we arrived and parked I watched her assembling her business mask. I tried to emulate her as best I could so when we arrived at the door we were merely two professional women carpooling to work.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The day passed even faster than Monday, which I wouldn't have believed possible. Somewhere in the hustle I'd managed to get my advance arranged and slip down to the bank and get it cashed. Evening found us leaving together once more. "Want to come over tonight?" She asked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hmmm, it seems I'm not busy tonight, sure. After I run by my place and pay the rent."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Let me drive you. It's not far and it'll be quicker. This way you have a quick get away if you need it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Christie was in fine form when I opened the door. "Oh look, she's back. Wellll, looks like you had fun last night. Who was she? Another one who hasn't found the right man yet? At least you have the rent. Good, now I won't have to heave out your stuff for at least another month."</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "I'd love to sty and chat, but I need to go. I still prefer men that I can put in a drawer when I'm done with them, unlike the one you're stuck with. Do you enjoy it when he goes limp before you're done? Have a 'nice' night."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her insults floated down the stairs behind me. Soon Amanda and I were off to another part of the city. We spent a lot of time prowling the late night shops at the spaceport before heading back to her place again. It was a pattern that became common between us. We never really talked about a committed relationship, or monogamy, or anything else really. We just drifted together as an extended series of one night stands that linked together over the years.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After two months I returned to Christie's apartment and recovered what was left of my stuff. Fortunately I hadn't acquired much, since she hid the best stuff away for herself. She continued her screaming and abuses all through the time that Amanda and I were loading. Several years later I finally found out why she grew to hate me so much. In the course of my lawsuit against Jaxson and Deville Co. I had implicated several others as harassers besides Miles Jaxson himself. One of them was her boyfriend Tom.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Servalan returns */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* use somewhere in her recovery process */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I couldn't believe she'd let the viper speak. Often she had told me of Servalan, about her obsessions and brutality. Now she was letting her stay near us. She was almost convincing with her tale, though. Her emotions felt honest. By the end of her narrative she seemed more a bitter, broken woman, than the evil monster I had thought her to be.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Carefully we guided her to the couch and enfolded her in our warmth. For a long time she didn't seem to notice. Finally she looked up, frightened and confused. Her fear was a living thing, ruling her every thought. Tenderly, yet securely, we held her close until the fear gave way to the agony trapped underneath. When she finally cried herself into sleep, we carried her to bed and held her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* home and leaving */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Mucking the stables again, at least it gave me privacy and time to think. Preoccupied, I didn't notice the shadows until a rope dropped around me and pulled my arms to my sides. Rough hands slammed me into an empty stall, up against the rough plank walls. "Hurry up, will you?" Hissed a voice as I was spun around to see the leering face of one of the hired hands. His hips pinned me to the wall as he ripped my shirt open.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">One hand pinched and squeezed my breasts as the other fumbled at my work pants. I struggled against him, screaming, kicking, and biting but my fourteen year old body was no match for him. He shoved his face against my chest and yanked my pants down just as I heard a startled grunt, followed by a thud, from outside the stall.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My attacker whirled with a startled, "What the hell?" Devren's fist struck him full on the chin and he crumpled to the ground. Devren quickly unbound me, then turned away as I hauled my pants up, holding them with one hand, and holding my shirt closed with the other. Unable to look him in the eyes, I stood trembling as shock set in. Gently he guided me back to the house.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I slipped into the kitchen and was heading for my room when father's voice stopped me. "What happened to you now?" Head lowered, I explained. "So, what did you do to encourage them? I won't have one of my daughters soiling herself with the help."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shocked, my head snapped up, "Encourage them?! I was attacked. I didn't do anything." I knew I was only a girl in his eyes, but I hadn't expected that.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You women are all the same, you want it all the time, until you get it, then you claim you don't want it. Now get upstairs, put on something decent, and finish your chores." With that he turned back to his breakfast.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Midday meal was even worse. Part way through the meal father turned to my half sisters and asked, "Would one of you please explain to Farni that she has to learn not to lead the help on?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After much giggling and laughing Leslie turned to father, "Her, lead them on? How could they be interested in a skinny little bean pole like her?" To me she added, "Don't be friendly to them, don't talk to them, don't do anything to or for them, pretend they don't exist. They aren't worthy of anyone in this family, even you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* a few years later */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">First came the stables, then breakfast, then the chore assignments. It was all I could do not to shout for joy when I was assigned to the books again. Father thought it was degrading to do paperwork, so once he found out I could do it I often drew the assignment. On cloudy, rainy days like that one, it was a delight to be able to stay inside, not to mention the mental challenge was a welcome change from grueling physical labor.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was thoroughly engrossed in my task when I heard several horses gallop up out front. A solid knocking came from the front door as I hurried to open it. Three bundled figures pushed past me and moved to the fire, dropping their cloaks on the way. They could only have been hills men by the way they were dressed. One, more flashily dressed than the others, stared me up and down like I was a slab of meat, then demanded, "Well, don't just stand there girl, bring us something warm to drink, and be quick about it!" As I hurried toward the kitchen I heard him mumbling something to his companions that brought howls of laughter.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I bustled about the kitchen fixing coffee after sending Chaya running for father. Carefully I carried the steaming cups back out to the fire and passed them around. I was treated to a shy, friendly smile from one of the others and another predatory look from the flashy one.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I had just retired back to the kitchen when father dashed in, demanded food fixed for the guests then strode into the front room. A long, sometimes heated discussion followed. I busied myself with the food then quietly slipped it onto a table near the fire. As I turned to go I heard father ask, "What would you consider as a token of good faith toward our alliance?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The leader turned, looked me up and down, then replied, "Her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Father looked startled, "Are you sure? I have other, more beautiful and useful daughters."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, she is the one I wish. I shall return to my brethren and explain this proposal, should they accept, I shall return for her in two weeks time."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">I stood frozen in place until the leader smiled, not kindly, and moved toward me. His motion freed me at last and I ran. Shouts of stop and wait followed me as I sped through the kitchen and into the yard. Slipping and sliding on the wet grass in my haste I struggled to reach the barn and a horse. I burst past Devren into the barn, grabbing for Serlitha's stall as he turned a questioning gaze my way. "I've been sold, a bargaining chit to the bandits." He was swinging the house door closed as the running men closed on in. Frantic, I tugged Serlitha from her stall and sprang onto her back. I heard a sickening wet thud as a sword chopped Devron down. I kicked Serlitha into the rain and galloped for the road. Hoarse shouts followed as I fled, then the sounds of quickly roused horses.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Luck was with me and I reached the trees before they had gotten their horses moving. Slowing a bit we threaded our way between the trees, seeking a large creek I knew of. When I spied it, we plunged in, moving carefully up it, torn between the need for haste and the need to leave no trail. After a mile we waded out and slipped across a small clearing, then into the darkness of a narrow, winding cave. Gently, I coaxed Serlitha deep into the darkness, constantly checking to ensure she didn't rub against the close walls. Finally we reached the end and a small chamber with a still pool.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shivering with reaction and wet I slumped to the ground and tried to take stock. I had fled with nothing but a house dress and my small dagger. I pulled it and readied myself to sell myself dearly should they find me. Unbidden, Devren's face sprang into my mind. I remembered long talks with him. Times I had questioned the order of things my father espoused. He had spoken of alternatives, of some places where women weren't just property, but looked upon as equals. Then I saw the sword cutting through him. Each detail painted in slow motion as it chopped downward, slicing through him. His look of surprise and the leader's look of pleasure. Suddenly it was all I could do not to wretch. I sat, choking back sobs, as tears streamed down my face.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* arrival of Servalan */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was late at the offices of Avilla Trading. Amanda and I were just getting ready to leave when the door flew open and a young woman rushed in. Her panic and fear coiled about the room, immediately drawing our attention. "Please, I know you don't know me, but I need your help!" We stood confused until she said, "Avon recommended you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What is it? What do you want?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I need your help back at a ship, we just arrived. Please I hope it's not too late." She was backing out the door even as she spoke. Amanda glanced my way, shrugged, and headed toward the door. Still dazed from the girl's raw emotions I followed along.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As we neared the docking area I saw Amanda looking more and more puzzled. "That ship, it looks familiar, but I can't quite place it." The closer we got, the slower she went, until the girl was actually dragging her along.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She led us to one of the cabins and stood nervously to the side as we entered. Amanda hung back so I was next through the door. There was a woman's body huddled on the bed, staring into the distance, but I felt nothing from her, just emptiness. Concerned, I started toward the bed only to be stopped by Amanda's hissed, "Servalan. What is she doing here? I thought she'd died."</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "Please, you've got to help."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I looked from Amanda's white, angry face, to the girl's fearful concerned one. "What's happened here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She told us about the death of Servalan's son Torr, her lover, and how she'd wanted to hurt Servalan for it. She had needled and poked at her until one time she screamed for what seemed like hours, then collapsed. "That was four days ago. She'll sort of eat, if you put something in front of her, but she hasn't moved or spoken. I don't know what to do. I looked through everything on the ship until I found files that listed Amanda's name, Avilla Trading, and this planet. I think she was coming here to find Amanda, but I have no idea what she wanted."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly Amanda approached the bed, softly calling Servalan's name. Nothing happened. She looked thoughtful for a few moments, then said, "Alexa...Alexa?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A little girl voice emerged from the woman on the bed, "Mommy, mommy...where are you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I hadn't thought Amanda could get any paler, but she did. Silently she mouthed, "SHIT" and tried again. "Alexa, it's me, Amanda."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Servalan smiled, "Amanda, did I oversleep again, is it class time?" She glanced around the room, suddenly looking disoriented, "Where am I? What's happening?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's ok, go back to sleep now. I'll wake you in time for everything." Quietly, but frantically she motioned us back out of the room.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* dev snippets */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* women's meeting */</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> At meeting of fem group when a post op transgender enters, someone makes very disparaging remarks about the viability of letting one of those 'women' in, individual delivers small commentary before leaving in tears, maybe someone goes to help them, maybe Servalan?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It surprises Amanda and Farni greatly that she would take interest at this point in her recovery, she becomes very adamant about how bad the reactions are, hits a tender nerve, being judged without any idea of what is really happening inside someone's head, something that has happened to her a lot.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Need to buildup scenes where Servalan has been very quiet, introverted, and docile to the point of submissive after her crash, this is the first time she has stood up to anyone or for anything since she began her recovery.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Need a bit of background on Teresa, a recent post op transsexual, known to Margot before her change, she did not realize Margot knew her background otherwise she might not have come in, Margot was incensed at the thought of what Teresa had been and had spread her story around before the meeting.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* written scene - one option */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Two days before the monthly meeting of ____ Margot came by to discuss some things with Amanda. Her biggest concern seemed to be over a post operative transsexual that was thinking of trying to join the group. She was convinced 'he' would be nothing but trouble. She continuously gloated over the fact she didn't think the person realized she knew 'his' secret. As the evening continued she always returned to the topic, trying to convince us that there was no way this should be allowed. By the time she left both of us were ready to accept this person, if only to slap Margot down a bit. Ever since she had been elected coordinator of the group she'd become more and more dictatorial.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Teresa entered shortly after the meeting began. Her arrival prompted mutterings and comments all around the table. As she reached for a chair Margot reacted, "What do you think you're doing here? We don't want you here. Go away. This meeting is for women only."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But I am."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, you're still a man, changing your form doesn't change that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Teresa's face went white as she clutched the back of the chair. "What...how...who..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It's obvious. You can't masquerade as one of us, no matter what your form."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you judge me? Until you can read minds how can you sit there and tell me who or what I am?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Once a man, always a man. Next thing we know you'll try and take over the organizing and prioritizing of this group, trying to create your own little empire."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You talk of equal rights and opportunities for all, I guess it's just the same bullshit. Equal rights for those that fit the model and screw the rest. I chose to give up my male prerogative so I could live in the form I belong in. I chose to give up my heterosexual privilege so I could love the women I am drawn to. The rest of you were born into your forms and all too often hate what you have. I'd kill to have the biology you revile. If I could I'd gladly trade any one of you bodies. I see it's just another case of equal rights for some. I guess I don't belong here either." Tears running down her face, but shoulders back and proud, she turned and strode toward the door.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I hope you're all proud of yourselves. I, for one, know what it's like to be ostracized. There was someone with the courage to be true to themselves and you scorned her. I admire her courage and wish I had even a tenth of it. Do any of you truly understand what she gave up?" Servalan's voice echoed in the silence following Teresa's exit. She leaned to Amanda and whispered, "Remember our discussions long ago about the politics of power, and the games behind it? Think of it and look at this room. I'll see you later, I'm going to take Teresa home." She stood and followed Teresa, leaving stunned faces around the table.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Amanda spoke quietly, almost as if she were talking to herself, "You know, each of us around this table have things in our past we hide away at home, or where ever. Things we hope others will never need to know about. As such it is very hard to ever really know another person. For example, I was once the assistant and lover of one of the most ruthless people in the Federation. Many times I wanted to run away or hide from what she was doing, but I was too frightened, and too greedy for the power of my position. Every so often I'd catch a glimpse of what was inside her, the small place that still hurt whenever she made a decision that blasted someone else, but I never had the courage to reach for that part of her. I just stood aside and watched it die. It still shames me. We rant and rave about how bad things are yet we sit here and try and create a small, elite power block. Here is what I see has just happened, 'Why don't you go away, you don't fit the mold of our group, we don't want you. You don't have the right connections to belong here'. Sounds an awful lot like a 'good old boy' network to me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So, what do you want us to do, embrace Teresa with open arms? I don't trust him."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No Margot, all I want you to do is analyze your motives here." Amanda replied quietly. " Why don't you trust her? Is it because she was once in a male form? Or is it because even with all the shit that happens to women here, she really wanted to be one. Does it, perhaps, make you feel less secure because you're not really sure you like the form you are in? Her choice raises many questions about what makes a woman. Is it just biology, or is there more to it than that? Maybe there is something to be said to all of us in this. Things each one of us should really think about." Margot's face remained cold and impassive, anger flashing in her eyes, but I noticed most of the others around the table were looking puzzled and thoughtful at Amanda's words.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The meeting dragged on for another two hours, most of it was bitching and carping from Margot and a few of her close cadre. Finally we came to the selection of officers for the next year. Margot was easily ousted from the coordinator's position and Amanda was put in her place. Marta became accountant. Next came the setting of the year's goals and projects. Discussions began to heat up when every time a new suggestion was put forth Margot attempted to block it. Finally we ended, deciding to try again at next month's meeting.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Finally we got out of there after most everyone cornered Amanda to congratulate her. Margot stalked by without even looking in our direction. "You know, I'm glad the fire hasn't completely gone out of Alexa, I was beginning to wonder if anything was left of her. It's hard to even think of her as Servalan any more." Amanda said thoughtfully as we headed for home.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I see Alexa's home. I wonder how Teresa is doing?" My question was answered when we entered the front room. They were on the couch. Teresa was curled up with her head in Servalan's lap, asleep. Looking at her it was hard to believe she'd been a man, she wasn't stunning or anything, but she was pretty.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* another women's meeting scene fragment */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Amanda and I looked at each other in disbelief, her surprise mirroring mine as we moved to follow Servalan. They stood down the hall, Teresa, bent down, with her head buried in Servalan's shoulder, crying, while Servalan stroked her hair. "It's ok, I understand. I'm proud of your courage. It'll be alright."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Servalan crash and burn */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* setup for the following scene */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Torr, Servalan’s son has just been killed attempting to kill Avon. Servalan has been shown incredible hospitality and kindness even after what Torr attempted.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This scene begins with Avon coming back into the library to talk to Servalan if she wanted. He wanted to know about Torr, mostly because Servalan had managed to get ahold of Avon’s genetics as part of what went into Torr. He has just wished her a good night after finding out she plans to return to her estates. She is still living alone, he is not. One of his last comments is, "But unlike you, my dear Servalan, I found I didn’t like sleeping alone."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* the story section */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Avon turned and walked from the room, not seeing the tears his words had caused. So many years, so many lives, yet everything had turned back on me. The more I thought I'd have my vengeance, the harder it bounced back at me. I would leave in the morning, back to my estates and my empty bed. Never before had the thought seemed so empty. As I walked to the door I passed by a table and saw a picture I'd not noticed before, two women holding each other and smiling, one chestnut haired, the other with long, honey colored hair. She seemed familiar somehow. In a trance I crossed to the table and slowly pulled the picture closer. I fumbled it from the frame and read the back. "To my friend Vila, thank you for our lives! Amanda and Farni." My knees buckled and I fell in a heap as pain, loss, and hurt flamed through me. Helpless I felt pieces of me burning and shredding away until blackness closed in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Amanda was holding me, running her fingers through my hair once more, while I cried like I never had before. Her voice whispered love and understanding as she tried to sooth my endless pain. Suddenly her voice changed and I heard her say, "Couldn't you find someplace better to sleep than the floor?" Confused, I opened my eyes to a pair of slippered feet and Avon's voice. "Didn't like the bed in your room?" I rose and pulled fragments of my dignity around me as I quickly placed the picture, still clutched in my hand, back on the table.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "A cold bed or a cold floor there isn't much difference, is there?" Quickly and quietly I slipped through the still silent manor, into the early morning.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I sat in my ship staring into emptiness, remembering. Torr's death played over and over in my mind. In slow motion I saw him dive at 'Blake', heard shots ring out, watched him crumple, then saw them comforting each other. Several of them even tried to comfort me, even after everything I had done. Over and over I told myself I was strong, I didn't need help from anyone, yet this time it wasn't working. I couldn't forget images of Amanda, holding me, listening while I rambled on about a problem or hurt. I tried to hate her for deserting me like all the others, yet she had stayed for so long, and through so much. Finally I set course for my estates.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Throughout the journey I managed to keep everything shoved away. It wasn't until I'd set down at the estate field that it all crashed over me again. Everywhere I looked I could still see my son. I rode from the field in silence, looking neither left nor right, concentrating on the back of the driver's head. Inside I briefly told Simon, the house steward, what had happened and then hurried to my rooms. A few minutes later I opened the door, ready to summon Simon back when I heard him talking to Solina, Torr's latest lover.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Quietly I retreated to wait until he was finished dealing with her. I couldn't stand still while I waited and found myself prowling my office, touching this, picking up that, not seeing any of it.  As I heard him moving by I called him in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "Simon, I will be leaving for a time, I don't know for how long. Until I return you will be in charge of the estates and holdings. When I return all profits will be divided equally between all people still on the estate." The shock painted on his face was almost funny to watch. I would have smiled if it hadn't felt like my face would crack. "I am leaving you the access codes to the necessary accounts and systems. I will also leave you an emergency code that will get you in touch with me should you need to. Don't call for anything less than disaster, I trust you to handle everything else. Now, please inform the rest of the estate that I wish their presence at dinner in three hours. Thank you." He started to say something then took a look at my frozen face and hurried away.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Next I headed to the kitchen and arranged for a simple meal for the others. My next order of business was arranging an operating account for myself, followed by ordering my ship supplied. Finally I dressed in the least formal things I had and set to work trying to track down Amanda. It was harder than I had expected, she had learned more from me than I had realized when it came to covering tracks. When I was done I knew she was working for Avilla Trading on Berzan and it was time to address the staff.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I gave the staff a few minutes to get settled then went down. The buzz of conversations stopped the instant they spotted me. Quietly I moved to the head of the table and delivered my little speech. "As you've probably heard, Torr is dead. He died quickly and with little pain. I am unable to remain here right now and will be leaving as soon as I've finished talking with you. When I return, the profits of the estate will be split among those of you who have stayed. I would like all of you to do so, but will understand if you cannot, or do not wish to. I do not know how long I'll be gone. Simon will be in charge until my return. Thank you." Tears were running down my face as I turned and walked away. Conversation erupted behind me, but I didn't even turn when I heard my name called.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It took another hour to finish with all the loose ends and finally head back to the ship. I entered and stopped, startled to find Solina kicking and swearing at the console. "What are you doing, child?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "I'm trying to make this damn thing take me away from here but it won't."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Kicking and screaming won't help. Now leave, so I can be on my way."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Where are you going?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Far away, not that it's any of your business. Now leave!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, you owe me. Torr was my lover and you killed him. You at least
owe me for that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Owe you!?" I couldn't believe it, who did she think she was anyway. "I owe you nothing. Now, get off my ship."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Then I'll have you removed."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And you'll never learn what I knew of your son, the things he'd never dream of telling you." Curiosity stopped me. She saw my hesitation and pressed her advantage. "Take me away from here and I'll tell you of the Torr I knew, then you can put me down anywhere you like and be quit of me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "As you wish then." I turned to the computer and issued the voice identity sequence, specified a course to Berzan, and initiated launch.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There are several staterooms on this ship to choose from. Pick one and settle in, it'll be a long trip." So saying, I turned and headed toward mine, ignoring Solina.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Later, as I headed to the galley for a snack, I passed Torr's suite and found the door open. Inside Solina was wandering aimlessly, touching Torr's few items. I started to enter then changed my mind and continued on. She wandered in a few minutes later. "Why are you taking us to Berzan?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> "I don't see how it should matter to you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why are you running, Servalan? What do you hope to find? Or what are you trying to hide from?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing, not that it's any of your business, now leave me alone."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm carrying his child." Her words dropped me to the deck, as deep inside something started screaming. Images cascaded through my head, Torr as a baby, as a young boy, then blood and silence. Curled tight, whimpering, I huddled in the corner. Frantically I pushed further back as Solina moved toward me. "No, stay away from me! Don't touch me!" By the time she was within five feet of me I was screaming incoherently at her, but still she kept coming. Her touch was sandpaper on an open burn. Her arms as they wrapped around me were steel bands. Still screaming I retreated back into my mind, closing doors as I dove deeper, until I felt nothing, remembered nothing, and saw nothing.</p>
