<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Pyramid</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly they topped the rise and looked down to see the racing truck skid to a halt. Figures boiled out of the front and back, running toward the pyramid in the background. Another truck, coming fast slewed around the other and skated to a halt. Two figures leapt out the front and started firing at the running group. Thrown slugs zinged off rock and hissed into the dust.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen and Kara heard frantic conversation over the comm. sets as the pursued group broke and darted in crazy patterns toward the pyramid opening. Two of the lead group dropped and spun. Blaster fire sizzled through the dry, hot air. One of the pursuers screamed and dropped. The second dove behind a low ridge of dirt, still firing wildly as he dropped.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Suddenly one of the blaster wielders dropped as a slug dug a red furrow across its scalp. The other took one look and started backing quickly toward the group just now entering the pyramid. A name and some other words cut across the chatter in the comm. Gear. Within moments they were inside. Almost at once Valen saw a brilliant flare of energy flash across the pyramid. At the same instant the conversation in the comms stopped.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Cautiously the remaining grey uniformed figure rose and began closing on the downed runner. With a quick look at Kara Valen rose slightly and fired at the nearest truck. Her blaster ripped into it and hit a spare fuel canister. A bright red flower erupted from the back of it. The startled grey uniform swung back to the truck, looking for the cause of the explosion. While he was distracted Kara slipped quickly down to the prone figure. "Valen, she’s alive. Can you keep that one distracted while I get her clear of here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I think so...shit, another vehicle on its way. You’d better hurry..." Carefully she lined up on the approaching truck and squeezed off. It swerved madly as a small fireball erupted from under its hood. "I just got you a little more time. I’m going to circle back around. See you soon." Figures leapt out of the back of the truck and began firing toward Valen’s vicinity.</p>
