<p class="regtxt5">Farni - shorter than Amanda, slight, willowy, dark red/brown hair, sim. robyn's, skin tone sim. Anita, fine hands, plays harp and flute (Vila also plays flute), likes to work with plants (esp. flowers and herbs, vegies when they have a garden. She has hazel eyes that seem to change color, makes metal jewelry, weaves on loom, a nester, she is the one responsible for finding the little things that make their residence a home. Beta to Amanda's alpha and very happy with it. She is homebody, and a floor sitter, doesn't really like to cook. She is fairly quiet, but don't underestimate her intelligence, she is a careful observer and very sharp at interpreting what she sees. Her hair is wavy from being braided, do to its finer nature. She is from this world, from a ranching family near the low pass.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Farni is the fourth out of ten children. She has two older brothers and one older sister. She has four younger sisters and two younger brothers. Her father is rather annoyed that his current wife has produced more girl children, as they are worth less to him than boys.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She was the only daughter from her father's second wife, she 'wore out' quickly and died after only four years with him, miscarriage complications rendered her sterile after Farni's birth because her father wouldn't seek proper medical care for her, he views women as bargaining items, unpaid servants, and baby factories.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Farni has her slight build and delicate appearance. Her childhood has given her a wiry toughness not really evident in her build. She is the only dark haired, darker skinned daughter in the family and is somewhat outcast by most of them because of this.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Her father is disappointed and resentful of her mother's untimely death, forcing him to seek a new mate quicker than usual. He is working on wearing out wife number three. She's been with him for 13 years now and is showing symptoms of the strain of too many babies with too little rest or care.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Family had some type of connection with banditry in the hills. She was good at admin from being a younger daughter and having to do so at home. She didn't like the ranching life and left for the city when she was of age. Her father was true chauvinist, she and her sisters treated as second class citizens, her worse than others, she was only daughter of father's second wife, who died approx. 2 years after her birth. Father tends to wear out wives. Rest of the family are blondes and redheads. She was middle to younger child with 6 to 7 additional siblings. Left to fend mostly for herself as a young child, except given scut chores that no one else would do. Had to learn to fend of passes as became older and pretty. Had an older male friend who was one of the hired help, who taught her how to defend herself, and that she didn't have to take much from most people. Father mostly ignored her until a young bandit leader came to negotiate a new alliance and when father asked what would help seal the alliance, the leader pointed to Farni and said "her". Predisposed lesbian but had no concept o the notion, had to learn about the possibility from Amanda. She quietly rebelled when she left, she entered school and fought hard to support herself and take classes she wanted. Was fired from a company after she refused her boss's advances and took him to task using newly established worker protection laws. Branded as troublemaker by previous employer. When she applied with Amanda's firm her application was red flagged by the receiving personnel clerk but passed on anyway because the personnel director was a closet feminist male. The red flag indicated she was a potential troublemaker, and possible embarrassment. Amanda was intrigued and brought her in for an interview and hired her on the spot.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Almost raped by a couple of hired hands when she was 14. She was saved by Devren who taught her self defense.</p>
