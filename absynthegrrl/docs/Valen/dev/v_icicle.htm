<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Time on Icicle</p>
<p class="regtxt5">An item was found by a prospector living out from one of the settlements. She had to track them down and try to get the info. Her orders were to destroy the item and kill any who knew of it. In the process of tracking it down she saw the item and it changed her. She worked to conceal it and protect those who knew. This lead to her working her way into Icicle politics which provided her the foot hold into Alliance politics. She leveraged this into her coup.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It had taken over a year but Valen had finally tracked down the person to first report the artifacts. Valerie Cantrazel, a prospector working the Northern Wall, had been the first person to see the artifact. She had come across it in a deep crevasse at the foot of the wall.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Long after she leaves Icicle she will still light a candle for Valerie Cantrazel on her birthday and their anniversary every year. She has done this without fail for the years since Valerie's death. If she has it she will also drink a simple toast to her. She tries not to be observed doing it, however Kara happens into the galley when she has the candle lit on the table. "It’s in memory of her, my friend on icicle. I promised her I'd light a candle on her birthday to remember her."</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Insertable</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I first saw Icicle as the transport ship swung in to dock at Platform One. There was a cold beauty to the white ball floating in the blackness that I hadn't expected. The briefing docs painted a bleak picture of a frozen world inhabited only by the miners forced to work there. Bitter cold, freezing winds, and hard effort to drag out chemicals for use in pharmaceuticals and beauty aids.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was met at the grimy dock by two scruffy men in miner garb. "Neshkala Ternika?" They led the way deeper into the station, twisting and turning through the battered corridors until they were certain no one was following us. At last they opened a compartment door and motioned me in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was silent while one of them ran a sweeper over the room. He spoke once he was certain everything was clean, "Welcome, ma'am. We are your primary support team for this mission. I am Emil and this is Kristoph. Ops sent us the basics, however, any specifics you will need to share if we need to know them." Emil was short, stout, and darker skinned, placing him as coming from Shadrizaar, at hot, high gravity world. Kristoph was tall, thin, and pale, and could have been from any number of worlds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Any more info on the primary target?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much. Valerie Cantrazel, she works the southern wastes, mostly Desolation Mer, as a propector. Comes into the camp every few months for supplies and to report any findings. Otherwise, she lives in a remote structure closer to where she is prospecting," Emil replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mostly a loner, although she has a few acquaintances among the miners at camp3, including a man named Atron Minterran. Some say they might have been lovers in thepast. Currently Cantrazel doesn't seem to have any attachments. Atron has casual affairs with a few of the camp personel, but nothing serious," Kristoph added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Local conditions? The data package is no replacement for actual experience, I have found."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Prepare to freeze your...uh, it's really fucking cold all the time and the winds never really stop. I'm only warm when I'm here on the station. The food seems to be mostly grease and fat, at first you'll hate it, then crave it as your body demands oils to replace the ones stripped off by the dry air. Oh, and everyone is coarse, vulgar, and rude. Better grow a thick skin quickly if you're sensitive at all," Kristoph answered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks for that, but I was thinking political, legal and intrigue points."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sorry ma'am. Local control is maintained from this and the other two DevelStar platforms. Law enforcement is lax unless it is to protect corporate assets. If you need to remove the prospector, there will likely be no investigation. Only the miners and a few lower class support people live on the surface."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Or those that have fallen afoul of the corporate leadership on the platforms," Emil added. "The cover we have prepared is along those lines. You were a functionary for this quadrant and got yourself into trouble. Should cover you for knowing something of the area, but not many details. You'll be 'assigned' to the accounting section of camp 3 so you can easily find out about the alleged target. DevelStar is cooperating, after a fashion. They won't help you if you get into trouble, but they will support your story and let you work in the job class your cover has you in."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good work. That should get me close enough to scope out what's really happened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Emil pointed to two large bags sitting in the corner. "Those contain the standard issue gear for a worker of your class. I suggest you change in the next compartment and leave anything non-standard with us. There's a DevelStar orientation scheduled for an hour from now. Once it's done they'll load all the new comers onto a shuttle." He pulled an electronic ID pendant from a pocket, "This is your corporate ID, it includes your meal and com allotments, quarters key, e-passcard to your work stations, and the authentications for your workstation. The com account is set up so any calls to us or to HQ won't be logged, charged, or tracked."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The cold made itself known on the shuttle ride down. Once we cleared the ionization layer and hit the winds in the thicker atmosphere it began leaching the heat from the shuttle. It was the first time I realized that the vacuum of the void made its incredible cold less dangerous than a planetary environment. The port was even colder with puffs of cold air leaking in through any crack. Miners hurried about, bundled up in multiple layers even in the camp connecting ways and rooms. There were few doors to the outside, usually emergency points and the bays for transports, personal and larger.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Every arriving new comer, or slushie, as they were called, was assigned a guide to help them settle in or take them to the staging point for travel to their assignment. Mine was an old, sour woman, named Marsha, who cursed and mumbled her way through most activities. She settled me in a tiny room with a narrow bed, electric cooktop, and combination armoire, chest of drawers. "Common sonic cleaner and toilet are down the hall. Drop your crap and I'll show you the mess hall and where you report in the morning." I tried to memorize the twisted tangle of narrow passages and rooms she threaded me through.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The mess hall was just that. Greasy food, battered dishes, bent silverware, cracked and warped plastic chairs and chipped and damaged tables. Marsha pushed me into line, "You're too skinny, better eat up if you want to survive here." I selected a  few of the less offensive looking items from the array, swiped my ID, and sat at an empty table. Marsha wolfed down her food while I picked at mine. It was terrible, in the way only institutional food, produced for large numbers, can be. "Hurry it up girlie, this place won't wait on your prissy ass." She walked me back past the offices again and left me in my room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I gave her a while and then I slipped back out. I spent a few more hours walking through the various areas of the station until I had a firm grasp of how it all went together. Sleep came quickly that first night, even with all the cycle changes between my last post, the transport, and Platform One.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Over the next weeks I settled into a routine of job, eating, and drinking. I never grew to love Icicle, but there were things I liked. The chill meant for the first time since getting the cyberware I wasn't feeling permanently close to overheating and it allowed me to have great fun showing up for work in tank tops and shorts. This is when I learned to love Icicle Everclear, first because it was a quick way to recharge my fuel cells and impress the locals, then because I started to really like the weird taste of it. Being able to drink with the best of them got me further than any of the in's provided by my cover with the company.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was several months before my target showed up at station three. I was in the miner's bar drinking and playing cards with some of the crew I'd gotten to know when Atron looked up, waved, and hollered, "Val, over here!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Atron, figured I'd find you here. Who's the new face?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Neshka Ternika, works in accounting, but..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mother's balls Atron, hanging with a company cunt? What's wrong with you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, ease up, Ternika's all right. She looks the other way when it counts and she got into it bad with sector corporate. Got into it even worse with Platform One. I keep trying to get her to quit the accounting group and get honest work."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure," she eyed me warily as she sat down. Her eyes never left me as she ordered a drink. "What you playing for?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just drinks," Atron replied. "Ternika here can't afford the real stakes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I itched to stare her down, to play cooler than her, but I got the impulse under control just in time, even managing to slop my drink a bit as if I was nervous. Her eyes slowly scanned the rest of the table before returning to watch me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Atron, you do know that would be the cover story if corporate wanted to slip someone in, right?" Val asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Paranoid much, Val? What would corporate want with us, anyway? They'd be after some of their own. Long as we make the quotas, they don't give a shit for us. How long you in station for, anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just a couple of days. Needed supplies. Stinks too much like company around here. The wind is cleaner."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Atron, I can go, come back later..." I started to say.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Naw, she's always this crabby. You're just a good excuse. She hates the crowds in station."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fuck you, Atron," Val said without rancor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wish!" Atron responded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I started to rise, stopping when Val said, "Sit, stay, play. For drinks is fine for now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Over the next two days I watched Valerie as much as I could. The more I watched the less she seemed like the threat presented in the briefing. Inquiries for more data were refused from my bosses, leaving my handlers and I on our own with what little we already had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We were all back in the bar, playing for drinks again, on the last night Valerie was in station. Irritable, tired, and discouraged by my inability to get any more information, I rose to leave the game. Valerie's voice sounded in my ear as I was about out of the bar, "Ternika, wait a minute." I turned and waited until she came closer. "I'd like to talk to you for a minute, if I might?" I nodded slowly, it probably wouldn't help, but maybe I'd finally get lucky. "Not here, somewhere a little less public, follow me?" She must have caught the slight change in look I couldn't quite stop, "I just want to talk." Silently I nodded again and followed her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She led the way to the garage and over to a battered ice crawler. She climbed inside and motioned for me to join her. Once the door was closed she flipped a switch under the panel and spoke,"I know you aren't Company, so that means you must be either a private investigator or Alliance covert ops. I know you aren't Company because you don't have the disdain they feel for the workers. You aren't Company security for pretty much the same reason. Company security can never quite loose the disdain, even when trying to be friendly. You probably aren't private either, you are just too good. So that leaves Alliance. Since there isn't a swarm of you, that means a small job, so probably not Company related. Which leaves me wondering why this station and why only you. It also leaves me wondering, is what I found so threatening that the Alliance would send a covert operative? And my last question, would you please tell me why before you kill me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's quite a story. If you are certain I'm Alliance, why not just kill me before I take you down?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not a cold blooded killer, besides, what if I'm wrong? Atron and his crowd seem to honestly like you and I wouldn't feel right if I killed an innocent. I just want to know why an archeological find has placed me on the Alliance list."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was quite clever, I hadn't thought I was so easy to spot. "I am Alliance," I began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I feared so," she said as she slumped against the far wall of the crawler.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Normally you would be right to wonder, but you sent data on your find to a couple of religious fanatics. It normally wouldn't matter, they have enough integrity to seperate the secular from their own issues. Your find raises some very difficult questions, however, and they felt the need to suppress any hint of it. Again, wouldn't be an issue if one of them didn't have enormous pull with key members of the Alliance Council."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, go ahead then, get it over with, I'm not ready to die, but sooner would be better than later because I'm not going to tell you where the find is in either case."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not going to kill you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll make you kill me before I let you take me back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm not going to take you back. I have done terrible things in the name of the Alliance, but I am stopping at this. I would like to see your find, but I won't force you to reveal it. You have no reason to trust anything I say. I will leave you alone and I will cut the trail to you. As a last thing, I will stop any that come for you." She stared at me, forcing me to continue, "I don't support the directions the Council is going. Extremists of all kinds are creating more and more of the Alliance policy. We are on shaky terms with all the other political regions around us and it would take little to start a war with any of the non-human races. This isn't what I pledged myself to support."</p>
