<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Conversations</p>

<p class="regtxt5">NOTES:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">This is a repository of conversation fragments and ideas, for all time-lines of Irena, Valen, and the Hut.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Insert in stories as appropriate.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Balance Keeper and Kayara</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Update - Yara and Irena have known each other from before. This conversation takes place after Irena becomes the Keeper</p>

<p class="regtxt5">IRENA - comes in through the gate and walks toward YARA, where she sits on the steps of her vardo, sipping tea</p>

<p class="regtxt5">IRENA: Greetings, carnival mistress.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">YARA: I was wondering if you were real or just a shadow in the visions.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">IRENA: I am real enough. I have watched you with interest. It is rare for a temporal to achieve such mastery of the Sight. But you aren't really a temporal any longer, are you?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">YARA: Something happened when I partook of an illuminating poison. Something unexpected...</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Willem Wellingham</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On Energy</p>

<p class="regtxt9">IRENA: The most critical task facing any technology group is a sound energy policy. I have seen many worlds stand at the edge of greatness, only to be crippled because they ran out of cheap energy. Make sure you diversify your energy sources as completely as you can and always be leading the curve on new sources. No source of energy lasts forever.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../../gm_resources/npcs/mereret.htm">Mereret</a> Seeing while in Hut - at various times</p>

<p class="regtxt9">next time players and Valen are in a room have Mere come through and say all of the following, make her a bit like River in that regard and in the future, mentioning things that are real but obscure, "Why do you not tell them? Soul Feaster cannot hold a power."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"The stars whisper to me of a ancient spider in his web weaving his designs while trickster dances just out of sight. Violet eyes hunt for you in the dark. They want the warrior woman and the book she has read, the book of serpents. Shadow creatures are drawn to the eater of souls. They want and fear it. Their master needs it."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Poor demon girl. Two mommies she has but violet eyes didn't know. Poor pretty demon girl. Made to hurt daddy who isn't she was. Violet eyes and his tricks. Made her eyes like his he did."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Pretty one with seeing ring. See through the masks. Pretty one Skelos is in your blood. Skelos of the magicians. Warm sun and butterflies now. Maybe your friend wants it more than you."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">from Mere - she and Shan will encounter the party as they are out in Centrys - "the two seek the third. the empty one, the chaos one. the three great Powers to sit in council as at the beginning. spider spins the web of unbalance. foolish spider, nasty spider, does not understand, can not understand, incapable of understanding, poor fool spider. would feel sorry for spider if he were not bad."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">at another time from Mere - "hand reaches to destruction while seeking creation. draws the end as seeks eternal"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kara - about security service</p>

<p class="regtxt9">VALEN: I left because I got tired of the compartmentalised lies. No one had the full story of anything. More missions were about political infighting and power brokering than security of the alliance. Once I pieced that together, I could no longer respect my bosses or do their dirty errands. I finally broke when they told me to kill a civilian for the simple fact of finding something inconvenient to the beliefs of one member of the assembly. I tried to reduce that in the Empire security group, but I don't think that was very successful either. People drawn to clandestine affairs love the game of it, no matter how pointless, dirty, or self-serving. It's like power, if a person wants to do it, they shouldn't be allowed to.</p>
