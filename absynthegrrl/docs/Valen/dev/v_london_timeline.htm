<p class="sectioncaption">Things to remember throughout</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* look at European situation for this time frame and mod to fit this reality */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* In this story there is less incentive for the Hut crew to be concerned about the affairs of the locals. It would be possible for them to more easily befriend Angelique if she doesn't immediately attempt to harm them. They would only need to fight her if they were trying to protect the Wellinghams, or other locals. */</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">Things to consider revising</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* keep the watchers and stuff? */</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>
<p class="regtxt5">hut emergency lands in 1890s london in an alternate reality - this is the same one where Krys landed in the future.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* maybe land in Whitechapel area at Jewish Cemetery - if don't want to keep them outside the city or if don't keep the Wellinghams */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">use the gaming data for most of this - tweak anything that might be copywritten - ie, might need to remove Fu, definitely remove references to Spike and make more generic vampyr. leave the count as a good guy. rename the dracula specific people.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen's approach will be to gather data about surroundings before attempting to move outside. will still need to deal with the perimeter issues - should manage before it escalates into anyone getting killed. "So, we don't know much about this place. Is there any way we can at least understand the language?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara will have the Key as ITU. determine if any of them have their ship board translators on them. They will not work perfectly, but should get them close. Also remember this is a male oriented society and only Will fits the profile.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Could have them meet Angelique first - after the alley save, or could be a save of one of the Wellingham staff, something on the estate and nearer the hut... */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Issues - how does Angelique know of Lucy? Why is she interested in CIWL(rename) */</p>
