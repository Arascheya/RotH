<p class="regtxt5">Could be when Valen and Sarah were still alive, before Valen takes her place.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There were a few of us hanging out in our room. Amanda was there and so was Sarah, Sarah was mentioning the latest in government cover-ups and how the rebels position was never accurately portrayed. "Sarah, we are all fed propaganda by our own side. If I listen to the news, I get the Alliance propaganda, if I read the rebel stuff, I get theirs. No one has the ‘truth’ of the matter, and each will use the events to portray themselves as the ‘right’ side."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The information I get is more correct than the tailored lies of the government."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Could be when Valen and Sarah were still alive, before Valen takes her place.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why, because it agrees more with what you want to hear? I agree, there’s no reason to trust the system, but why should I trust your leaders either? How will I know they won’t fuck me just as hard once they’re in charge? Do you really trust that much? Everyone edits the ‘truth’ to fit their own needs and wants."</p>
