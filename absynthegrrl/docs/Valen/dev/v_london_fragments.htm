<p class="regtxt5">/* after capturing a spy near the hut */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen bent in close to the captive. "You will tell us what you know."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Or?" he spat back.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen smiled coldly. "Well I don't like killing or torture much myself, but Shandi over here, well it doesn't bother her at all. I'll let her have you." Shandi smiled an insane happy smile. "She won't kill you, will you Shandi?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi lost her smile for a moment, then it returned even crazier than before. "No, long party! No matter how much begging." she said happily. She leaned in and stroked a sharp fingernail down the man's face, leaving a red track behind. "Oh look, pretty red..." she leaned in, flicked her tongue along the line and leaned back. "Copper, ordinary, boring."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* after capturing a spy near the hut - alternative */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen smiled pleasantly down at the bound figure. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way. Either way we will have the answers we need."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Bugger off."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The hard way it is then." Valen turned to the silent figure in the shadows. "Shandi, we need this person alive. Beyond that I do not care."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh goody, party time," a happy little girl voice answered as a thin blond woman glided into view. Madness danced a reddish flame in the depths of her eyes as she leaned down to the man. She caressed his cheek with a single finger its sharp nail tracing a line of blood behind it. "Look, pretty red...." she leaned in like a striking cobra and flicked up the line with her tongue. "Coppery, bland, no spirit this one," she sounded disappointed and for a moment a small frown creased her brows. "Oh well..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Now then are you going to tell us what we want to know? Shandi won't kill you, no matter how you beg. And believe me, you will be begging soon." the man flinched but remained silent.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi bent again and jabbed a finger deep into the cluster of nerves in his upper arm.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Valen mistaken for Slayer */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They heard the yell from an alley. Immediately Valen was off at a run. In the alley three men were circling a lone woman. As Valen closed one of them stepped forward and grabbed her. With a flick of her wrist Valen dropped a dagger into her hand and closed. It passed harmlessly through the man, causing him to yell and turn. In a blur Valen dropped her bag, pulling Soul Eater as she did. With a blurred spin she backhanded the man against a wall and closed. He shrieked as she plunged Soul Eater into his chest. "Magic weapons only..." Valen yelled. Then she screamed as Soul Eater poured liquid fire into her. Shrieking and howling in agony Valen slashed and tore at the figure until it dropped and Soul Eater pulled free at last. It slipped from her lifeless fingers as she collapsed in a heap on the slimy pavement.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi spun and darted to stand over Valen as she shook on the ground. Her hand a blur she slammed it into the chest of the nearest attacker and pulled out its non-beating heart. It dropped, landing inches from Valen. With a groan she began to rise. Shandi looked down and said, "Rest, my party now." Her hand flashed again and the third attacker dropped to join the others.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">No one saw the fourth man slip down the shadows of the alley.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* this would be the second round of vampyr killing - Angelique is watching to assess the risk of the new threat */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Angelique watched fascinated as Shandi waded through the attackers casually dealing death with wild abandon. She smiled and purred as she fought. Her hands slammed into chests, ripping dead hearts out and tossing them aside. Several opponents broke and tried to run as she closed. Her arm blurred as she snapped throwing stars into their retreating necks. Soundlessly they dropped as she spun to launch an attack at another, closer, target. Valen fought with grim determination. Krys fought with the detachment of the professional soldier, her emotions on hold until the battle was finished.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Soon the battle ended and Valen moved to finish the two with shuriken in their necks. Shandi reached them first. Ignoring the stake Krys threw to her she reached down and used her hands once more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Angelique smiled in the shadows, turned, and walked away. "Not yet demon girl, but soon. Soon we shall meet."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* first "dance" - Shandi and Angelique - where and when is this? CIWL offices? */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Scary demon woman..." the vampyr called from across the room. "Come dance with me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi leapt at her, slamming her back into the windows and through them. They landed hard in the street below, the vampyr on the bottom. With a shove she flung Shandi off and leapt up. Grinning wildly she followed through with a kick that spun Shandi into the wall of the building. "Dance fun," Shandi said as she hurled herself back at the vampyr, slamming a fist into her that threw her across the road. Back and forth they spun, kicking, throwing and pummeling each other.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At long last they pulled apart. Shandi sucking in deep breaths while the vampyr leaned against the wall to stay upright. They closed with each other again, throwing shaky punches until they slid down the wall to rest side by side. Valen watched fascinated from the window as they finally collapsed down the wall in exhaustion. Angelique turned to look at Shandi and leaned close. Seeing the vampyr leaning over Shan Valen leapt through the window and dashed toward them, stake in hand, "No, don't touch her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"See you again," Angelique whispered as her form shifted and hundreds of rats scurried off in all directions.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* second "dance" - Shandi and Angelique */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shandi, don't let the woman escape." Valen shouted as Angelique ran for the far wall. Darting around a group of crates she dove through the door into the shipping office and waited.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi followed close on her heels, darting through the door and slamming it behind her. "You not leave."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't want to leave." Angelique replied with a warm smile.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What want?" Shandi asked confused.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just to talk to you. You are quite interesting, do you know that?" Shandi moved a bit closer to the door and watched as Angelique stood quietly near a wooden desk. "You don't say much either I see." slowly Angelique padded closer. "We are alike you and I. You crave joy of the fight, don't you demon girl?" she spoke slowly and softly, as though to a wild creature. Carefully she reached out and ran her fingers over Shandi’s cheek, "I know, I feel it too. You're the first worthy of me." she leaned in and flicked her tongue over Shandi’s lips. "Mmmm, delicious."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi stepped back with a look of confusion settling over her features. "Why this? What want?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why demon girl, I want to see if you love as well as you fight." she leaned in again and bit down hard on Shandi’s nose. Immediately Shandi exploded into action. Punching, kicking and clawing they rolled around the room. Angelique gave a delighted laugh as they rolled together on the floor. "Yes, like this!" clothing tore under the assault of sharp nails and ripping hands.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Pounding on the door stopped them as Valen shouted, "Shandi, are you ok? We're coming."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Angelique rolled up onto her elbow and gazed down at Shandi. "Lovely demon girl." she leaned in and kissed Shandi gently. "We'll meet again." Her form shimmered and shifted as it flowed into a hazy mist and drifted out the window.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi leapt to her feet as the door splintered under the weight of Krys and Valen. "Where is she? Where is that murdering bitch?" Valen hissed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Gone." replied Shandi. "Turned mist, out window."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shan, are you ok?" Valen asked noticing her torn clothes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh yes," she replied with an unconscious smile. "Worthy dancer." she added cryptically.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* first date - Shandi and Angelique - go to museum gala for Egyptian Exhibit - optional */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Others see them dancing and kissing</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* third "dance" - Shandi and Angelique - ends in sex */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly the fight turned into rough sex with an odd tenderness underneath. Screams of pleasure rose from the tangled bodies on the floor as they sprawled back spent at last.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/*after third "dance" - Shandi and Angelique */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi stalked up to Angelique where she stood in the shadows. With a wicked smile she leaned in and nipped Angelique’s lips, then darted back away. She drew Angelique away from the alley and back toward the edges of London. "Where are you going my Demon Girl?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Follow home." Shandi replied, dancing away again. With a snarl Angelique followed. When they reached the clearing where the Hut was hidden Shandi took Angelique’s hand. "Soon," She walked to the center of the clearing, reached into empty air, and pulled open a door. Angelique froze as she looked through into an enormous stone hall beyond. Black marble walls arched to the ceiling sixty feet overhead. Gold veins swirled through it breaking up the absolute blackness of the material. Overhead clear gem stars winked and twinkled in a pattern like none Angelique had ever seen. A red light, hovering over a throne formed of large bones, threw shadows across the floor from the granite pillars supporting the roof.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What, what is this place?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Home. Follow." Shandi pulled her to a small door to the left of the chamber and opened it. Angelique followed her into a large dining room, with windows looking out over a carefully groomed garden. She led Angelique through the dining room and down a short hall to another door and opened it. Once they were inside she pulled Angelique into a close hug and kissed her fiercely. "Mine."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* elsewhere */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen’s head jerked up and she swore under her breath. Krys looked over at her from the book she was hunting through. "What is it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - "Shan’s back and she brought that vampyr woman with her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Krys - "Vampyr woman? The one that's been stalking Lucy?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - "Yes, Angelique."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Krys - "I don't understand what's going on with Shandi. I think she's letting her escape."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - "I think you're right and I have a theory. She’s the first challenge I've seen Shandi face. No one else has been close to her in speed or strength. Think about it, have you ever had the perfect sparing partner? One who could match you so well you didn't have to hold back? I think that's one of the things between them. For once Shan was challenged. There has to be a fascination in that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Krys - "a fascination...you think it's just that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - "I wish it were, but I've caught Shan slipping out and when she comes back she looks like she's been fighting. I'm going to set the hut defense systems to keep the woman out of critical areas and let things happen. The hut won't let her permanently harm any of us, so..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* once they are together - living in Hut */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"My scary demon girl what happened to you?" Angelique whispered softly to Shandi as she was sleeping. She reached down and softly stroked her cheek, "You don't smell or taste like anything I've ever known. So much pain and torment buried in you. And still you smile and laugh as if you haven't a care in the world." Shandi stirred slightly, moving into the hand on her cheek and smiling slightly. "So you can tell, even in your sleep, who is near you." she slipped into bed and wrapped herself around Shandi. Sleep claimed her in moments.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi woke first, for a moment wondering at the weight across her shoulder. Turning her head she saw Angelique sleeping behind her. Carefully she turned and looked at her new lover. Wild red hair splayed across the pillow shadowing one eye. no breath stirred the hair and she felt a faint stir of panic until she remembered there wouldn't be any. Smiling she leaned in and inhaled the scent of her, sandalwood, herbs, and just the faintest trace of old blood and decay. It was an odd mixture, but comforting to her. She gently kissed the sleeping lips then softly began to nibble and nip at them until Angelique stirred. Once a sleepy eye opened she moved and bit carefully at Angelique ear. The vampyr woke with a start and grabbed her in a hungry embrace.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Lips, tongues, and fingers stroked cold and hot flesh. Tangled in sheets and bedding they crashed to the floor. Rolling and thrashing they crashed around the room. Shrieks, laughter, and shouted names echoed from the thrashing bundle. In the throws of passion Angelique bit down on Shandi’s neck with fangs exposed. She screamed as the flavor and energy of Shandi’s blood triggered a mind shattering orgasm. The cool tug of Angelique’s fangs drove Shandi almost to the edge. The taste and scent of Angelique’s skin called to her and she bit down, tearing a ragged mark into her neck. Cold blood spilled onto her tongue, old copper, salt, and rich wine, it burned over her tongue in frosty waves. Shrieking as her orgasm cascaded through her she crushed Angelique to her. Shaking they collapsed in a heap in the tangled sheets. Kissing passionately they tasted the shared blood on their lips.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Angelique touched the mark on her neck with wonder. She turned to Shandi, "do you know what this means?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You have marked me. By vampyr society I am yours now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Marked?" Shandi asked as she touched the bite on her own neck.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, it means you have claimed me as your mate. And I have claimed you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi pulled Angelique to her and kissed her, "You mine!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once their strength returned they slowly disentangled themselves and dressed. Arm in arm they made their way to the dining room. Entering they found Valen and Krys already there.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* valen and krys on Angelique */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Krys - "why did we allow her in here? Vampyr, right? She’s dangerous."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - "and what around Shandi isn't dangerous?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Krys - through a laugh - "ok, got me there. Still..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - "Yeah, but think of it this way. We control the hut and can determine where she can go. also, have you ever had the perfect sparing partner? one who could match you so well you didn't have to hold back? i think that's one of the things between them. For once Shan was challenged. There has to be a fascination in that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Krys - "A fascination...you think it's just that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - "No, but whatever it is it seems to be good for her. Have you watched her hand talking lately? She is clearer, less jerky with the words. She needs less coffee to be awake as well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Krys - "It's just strange is all."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - "I know, although what with Shan isn't? Still though, have you really watched how Angelique looks at Shan? I believe she really cares."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Just then Shandi and Angelique walked in holding hands and sat down. Valen shot a smile at Krys before turning to the two. "Good morning. Sleep well?" she hid a smirk as they looked at each other with large grins. "In to biting I see, kinky."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi mock growled and made biting motions. "Yes, taste good." Angelique looked down and would have blushed if she could have.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Shandi and Angelique - long life */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi - how do it?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Angelique - what?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi - live long</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Angelique - grinning - I like it sweet one. I enjoy life and all the tastes, smells, and sensations of it. That’s the secret, especially if you want to get lots of it. I want as much as I can have and I'm nowhere close to finished yet.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Angelique - grabbing Shandi into a close hug - especially not now</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* note - Kaya and Stormy have a similar approach to their long lives */</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">Misc Scenes - not in any particular order</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* scene in fish shop where Sergei comes over to table and introduces himself after Mina and Lucy return to work */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Pardon my intrusion but I could not help but notice how your companion reminds me of someone. Please allow me to introduce myself, I am Prince Sergei Drakov of the Free states of Transylvania. Dear Lady you remind me of the S...of someone I know. Have you ever visited my beautiful homeland?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* or maybe...*/</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Speaking directly to Valen. "Good day S...Please forgive me, you reminded me of someone else. I am sorry to intrude."</p>


<p class="regtxt5">/* talking to Willem, Lucy, and Mina */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'm going to give the dreaded free advice. I know you probably won't use it. Few do, however I still feel like offering it. Treat your employees like people. Respect their ideas and needs. Promote them when you can and pay them what they are worth. The returns in terms of loyalty and productivity will be amazing. I have seen more ventures fail because the workers were viewed with contempt than for any other reason. Profit is a necessary part of business, no doubt, but don't make it the only measure. Consumer loyalty, worker loyalty, and reputation are more important than a consistent bottom line. Think for the long term and I would advise against any model where leadership only wants profits at any cost."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Talking to Willem about power.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know you already know most of this. However, I was forced from my station once because I wasn't paying attention to the right places. Therefore, I offer these warnings. Your enemies won't come at you head on. They'll slander you, attack from the shadows, drive wedges between you and your friends, and attempt to turn public opinion against you. The most important thing to remember is the less real ability present the more vitriolic will be their attacks. You represent the worst possible danger, the danger of true power, earned with honest effort, and maintained by the respect of those around you. Your attackers have little, but feel entitled to have so much more. They will tear you down to maintain their egos and paltry stations."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is possible to prevail, however, you must keep your friends close and keep your enemies even closer. Make sure you always know what they are doing and have plans in place to neutralize anything they try. If you can stomach private blackmail, gather as much against those that oppose you as you can. You needn't use it, merely make sure they know you have it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Those are interesting thoughts, however, I'm not sure they will help. Many of those that could threaten me are in inherited positions. The whims of the public have little impact."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is still possible, although harder. You need to be able to make them such embarrassments that their peers shove them out of play. Even a full monarchy can be overthrown if the populace becomes too disgusted with the way things are. You don't have to take it anywhere near there. Just far enough that the more stable players see the offender as damaging to their positions. Then they will muzzle the offender themselves."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It does still amaze me sometimes that my good fortune is seen as such a threat by some of my peers. I am especially puzzled why they think improving the lot of my work force is such an anti-social act. Why shouldn't my daughter have the same legal choices as I do? Why should she be expected to tie herself to a man and become subservient? I certainly don't expect that of Anne."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It has no basis in thought. You are changing things. Many people fear change. Often those in 'high stations' think they are entitled to that position, be it by blood, religious belief, or whatever. Anything that reduces the gap between them and the 'lesser stations' is seen as a reduction in their percieved status. Since that is all they have, it becomes the only way they can feel good about where they are. The few I've met at the various functions you have invited me to definitely fall into this category. They would be unable to survive a day in the world many of your workers live in. In truth, the disadvantaged are always much stronger than the advantaged."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">You have seen how I have arrived. This last I want you to think about if you can. This world is on the cusp of change. Monarchies are destabilizing, nation-states are struggling to expand and gain power, and in this mix, a few such as yourself hold a different sort of power. As you are aware, nation-states play the same games that the "upper classes" in this society do. As they vie for power they lurch and stagger like drunken fools, smashing anything in their way. Those of you with multi-national holdings will lose when the inevitable wars break out. Look at the situations on the continent. It would be easy for the Austro-Hungarians to make a grab. Others, with less to lose and more to gain, are even more likely to lurch about. You and your associates need to cement power, if you can make it impossible for the nation-states to go to war you will have greater chances to create an improved world..</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hesitate to say this in this time, however, beware religions. They exert great influence over those with nothing. What you are doing with your workers and your daughter can be the basis for something far greater than the paltry "empire" of the United Kingdom. It can change the entire world if applied by people of ethics.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*Willem bristles at her coment* this is a glorious empire!</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Then why are Lucy and Mina at such risk on a daily basis? why is the government covering up scandals on a routine basis? take what is good from it and discard the rest. *she holds up her hand to forstall comment* you won't achieve a tenth of this in your lifetime, but sow the seeds of it. forge alliances with every industrialist you can. deny the nation-states the ability to make war on a whim. force and pursuade your associates to treat their human assets with respect and dignity and you will see a world where Lucy and Mina's children will have a chance.</p>
