<p class="regtxt5">/* FE recruitment */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">FE will not attempt to recruit until the Hand is nuetralized. Kayara and Sharyl might contact them earlier, mostly to find out about their daughter. they would be the ones to redirect the library to the Hut - Kaya especially, it would fit her whimsy nicely, even if she did it under the nose of Elentaryn</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* can always shift POV to River Wind also as a break - show what Kara and the rest are going through */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* soul eater and such */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">soul eater was used to bind the Hell Gates and create the Guardians of the Gates. it therefore can sense and be sensed by these things.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the Hand needs Soul Eater to re-open the Hell Gates sealed by the Heroes of the Hell Gate Wars in 6717. he has his two remaining active guardians actively seeking it. they were closing in until the Hut jumped to London. he will re-establish contact once the Hut returns and Valen steps back out of it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tzylranor had a tower in the hidden valley above the dwarven first home. could tie this to man's birth caverns and to Kaltereth's tower if desired - if made them all the same place could make for some interesting things...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">if so - move all to the lone mountain on the current Lotus Empire map</p>
<p class="regtxt5">need to place High Valley and the active Hell Gate there</p>
