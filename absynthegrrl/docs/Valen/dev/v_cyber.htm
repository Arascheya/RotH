<p class="sectioncaption">Inside</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Heat oozed into the blackness first. Next came the fire, searing through her awareness and waking her into a silent scream of agony. Pain, everywhere she tried to turn. She retreated before it, trying to find darkness again, but it was nowhere to be found. Turning she focused on the agony, seeking the center of it, the way her mom taught her to do with headaches. Slowly it resovled into bands of fire with pain around them. She pushed back and found a bright blossom of agony. There she pushed her will against it, willing it to disappear. Slowly it crushed in on itself until it disappearied with a small pop. She turned to another, and another, working until her mind blanked from exhaustion and blackness wrapped her in a comforting blanket once more</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A bright green flash streaked across the blackness drawing her back again. Immediately behind it came a series of golden pulses that danced around, touching all the points of red agony once again. She followed them to the last red flame and pushed again. She thought to seek another when  she remembered the golden flashes. Searching her memory she found the feel of the green pulse and tried to create it in her mind. It took many tries but finally the golden pulses started up again. Following the last one she kept squeezing down on the pain again and again, stopping to create another green flash when she lost track of where she was.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Minutes, hours, days maybe, she's not sure how long, later she's done. The last of the pain blossoms has settled down to a thin green line of energy. Curiously she opened her eyes into the face of someone. Moments flash by before she remembers, "Hi dad. Where am I?" Colors dance and swirl around the lights, around the equipment near the bed, and around her in various places. Patterns dance and flicker in it and for a moment she is distracted until a voice pulls her back.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sara, are you awake honey?"</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Outside World</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Outside a series of monitor beeped drawing the attention of the tech half dozing at a console. Her head snapped up and she glanced at the readouts. Power draw to the cyber interface on patient 'S. Draybin' had fallen by twnety percent. She reached over and hit a comm button, "Dr. Alphonzo, please report to cyber ICU. I think we might be seeing another rejection reaction."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A portly middle aged man hurried into the room and glanced at the monitors. "Run a diag scan. Dr. Draybin will be very upset if his daughter rejects this."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They watched the results coming up on the various screens. Everything checked out although several of the interface sensors reported running at lower power. Just as they turned away from the monitors a message popped up, "Diagnostics running."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Melly? Did you leave diags on automatic?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No doctor." They stared at the monitors for several moments, watching the diagnostics running again. This time the power use was down again. Once more they carefully examined all the readings and just as the finished the diagnostics triggered again.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What's going on?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know!" Melly began looking at other monitors, checking the status of the other implant patients but they all showed expected conditions. Her eyes flashed across a bank of monitors on the back wall of the room. Monitors that shouldn't have been active at that time in the process. "Oh my god, doctor, she's awake!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She can't be."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Look at the EEG monitors."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Melly, get Dr. Draybin. Now."</p>
