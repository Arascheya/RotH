<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Hut Dreams</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* these can also be used for Irena V. in the Keepers stories */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* a dream of Aztol */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You are in a large hall, sitting in a throne as if you belong there. In front of you is a man dressed black leather with orange trim. He is standing just forward of a small group of men in orange and black armor. His face is handsome and composed. He smiles up at you with an almost gloating air then speaks, "Mistress of the Hut I ask for your assistance in this matter. Please grant me knowledge of the shifting majik you possess. In return I shall grant you several Ancient Magic items I have."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You shift to a more relaxed position on the throne and lean your head back as if in thought. Actually you are studying the throne a bit as you wait for a suitable pause before answering. The throne is formed from a large dragon skeleton. You are sitting looking out from where the ribs would be. Overhead a giant dragon skull forms a canopy. You are seated on fine silk cushions and more cushions pad your back from the spine that forms the back of the throne. Then you lean forward and begin speaking. "Upstart, what makes you think I would wish your tech? You seek knowledge beyond your wisdom, power beyond your ability. I shall not grant you anything. Take your rag-tag bunch of misfits and leave. Seek not to bother me again, for that day shall be your last."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">His composed face twists into a mask of rage. "You think you are so powerful. I will crush you like the insignificant fool you are. Soon the very demons of hell will tremble before me. You will beg me for mercy but it will be too late." His wild violet eyes stare into your calm ones as he spits and twitches with rage. "Doom shall fall upon you and I shall be its instrument." He turns and stalks from the room as the dream fades.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* meeting with the She... */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once again you are lounging in the dragon throne. Once you are comfortable your retainers throw open the far doors and your visitor enters. Walking in the center of a group of tall, thin figures is a woman whose face is completely surrounded by knives. She stops at the foot of the stairs to your throne and says, "Margla, Dimension Mistress"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mistress of Centrys, Defender of the Doors, what brings you here?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We must talk my friend."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Let us move to more comfortable quarters then. Your servitors may wait here." You descend from your throne and exit through a door in the side of the throne hall. Beyond the door is a small sitting room, dominated by two large, wingback chairs. There is a small table between them and a fireplace facing them. The room is gothic in appearance, done in deep reds, blacks, and wrought iron fixtures. Once you both have settled in you say, "Something to drink?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Silver Slyth liquor if you have some? It has been so hard to get since the Arduin plane has become unstable."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It shall be here momentarily," you reply. "It is a pity about that plane, there were so many interesting items there. Perhaps some mad techno or arcane will manage to re-stabilize it in time." For the next few minutes you both engage in meaningless talk until a fiend walks in and sets down the tray with two goblets, a cut crystal decanter of silver liquid, a small white porcelain dish, and a silver knife. "I have a couple of bottles of this set aside, if I might gift you one?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ever the gracious hostess, I shall certainly accept your kind gift." She... takes the decanter and pours a very small amount of the liquid out into the dish and touches the knife to it. The liquid immediately turns jet black. "Ah, one of the finest varieties I see.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You wound me. I would never serve inferior refreshment to a friend," you answer back smiling. "Now, what brings you from Centrys?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well..." and the dream fades away.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Visiting the Seer about release */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Stepping from the hut you can smell wood smoke in the distance. Threading your way through the forest you come to a narrow lane with a small clearing nearby. Pulled into the clearing is a brightly painted horse drawn wagon parked near a small fire. An old woman carefully tends it while she sips a cup of something. As you step from the trees she glances up and spots you, motioning you closer as she smiles. "Come, come, keep old Yara company for a few minutes. If ye have a few moons t' spare I can tell ye of your future. In any case come warm yourself at my fire and tell me what you seek."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly you approach noticing this woman looks similar to the woman in your dreams. The one Kayara told you to seek. "I seek a seer, a teller of visions, would you know anything of that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ah young missie, that I would, that I would. Sit ye'self down, have some tea?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You sit as she hands you a steaming battered mug of thick black liquid. "Tis my special recipe," she replies with a gap-toothed grin to your skeptical look. "Ye look tired, ye do..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Age is dragging me down."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The old woman lets out a cackling laugh and says, "Aye so t'is, ye mustn't be a day over 70 and still in the prime of yer life. Now age i could be tellin you about, when ye get t' over a hundred then..." She holds up a thin hand, "Nay, nay i see the beast in ye, how old ye really are, and the cold one who is your friend, least-wise as much a friend as either of ye can be.. now, tell old Yara what you be wantin."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Dreams of a dead friend told me to seek one such as you, I told you that already. You should be able to see the rest for yourself."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Don't be snip with me young missie if help you be wantin then keep a civil tongue about ye."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* talking about the multi-verse - somewhere and when in the Hut, probably after Awakening */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There is only one Fundamental Truth of the multi-verse and that is the multi-verse exists. Any other concept such as "morality", "ethics", "good", "evil", etc. are concepts imposed on the multi-verse by the residents. They reflect a desire to understand and, at some level control, the multi-verse. None of these concepts are binding, except to the participants that subscribe to them. Perhaps there is a second Fundamental Truth of the multi-verse as a result. The multi-verse is indifferent to the participants.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Irena in the Hut</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* truth of the multi-verse */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is only one spreme truth of the multiverse and that is the multiverse exists. All the other "truths", concepts, and ideas are the wish dreams of the participants, trying to understand something that just is. Which means the "job" of the Sisters is simply to make sure the multiverse continues to be.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dream 2 - Twelve Factols</p>

<p class="regtxt9">It woke you up, like a toothache, like a nagging memory just below conciousness. Drew you, still half asleep out the bedroom door, down the stone stairs to the first landing, and into the sitting room. A green spiderweb of light strands shimmered in the air between the two grey stone sphynx statues next to the right wall. It floated between their two facing heads, in a spot that had always been empty. It drew you, pulled at you, demanding you to move closer.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">At the very last minute you woke enough to run back to your room and dress before advancing to the web. At the touch of your hesitant hand you were spun through blackness to stand in front of a rough stone wall. Noise crashed over you, voices raised in countless dialects of strange languages. Odors of food, vomit, smoke, alcohol, and substances of unknown origin pummelled your nostrils. Dim light fought through the dense smoke to paint the large room in patterns of flickering red light.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">As your numbed senses began to recover you recognized a large tavern room, bustling with patrons and servers. The walls were carved and set stone and blocks. Across the room a wide stairwell rose. A dirty urchin, maybe nine or ten years old, tugged at your sleeve. "Miss Lady, there's a table over here. Come, sit, before you fall down. But 'member where your door is."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The urchin tugged you to a small table, set in a nook in the rough wall, and sat down opposite you. "It's ok, miss lady, you get used to it after a while." In the light from a flickering lamp on the table the urchin looked more like a young girl than a young boy. Her hand dug into a ragged pocket and emerged with a large cookie, wrapped in greasy paper. "Share my cookie? It's called oatmeal rasin and it's my favoretest in the whole world. Course I have to steal them cuz they're too 'spensive for me to buy."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The girl carefully unfolded the paper and solemnly broke the cookie in half, handing one part to you and taking a delicate bite out of the other piece. After a moment's hesitation you took a bite as well. Unimaginable pain crashed through your head, fragmenting it into colliding pieces. Each bump and grind bringing new levels of agony. The room spun, stars exploded and coalesced in front of you. You weren't sure if the shriek was only in your head or if your tortured voice gave forth with it.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You watched from a great distance as the urchin motioned a server over and asked for two glasses of klezarm blerkraz. "And who's going to pay for it, gutter-trash?"</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Miss lady will," she answered. The server looked your way and you must have nodded part of your head, because he grumbled something and left. He came back with two small glasses full of a billious yellow green slime and set them in front of you. "Take a sip, then a bite of cookie, then a sip, finishing everything with the drink. It will settle your head," the girl told you.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The first sip of liquid brough a lessening of the pain and an intesification of the images. You floated with in a circle with two others in the blackest void of space. Between you floated a ball of brilliant white light and a globe of absolute darkness. The three of you were chanting strange sounds, rising to a cresendo. At the peak the white light began to spew tendrils of flaming stuff while the black sphere collapsed into a deep well of nothingness. The tendrils fell slowly into the dark. "Welcome back, sister," the girl across from you spoke. Imposed on the urchin was a face of cold beauty. Her skin was grey, her hair white. "Finish your cookie and we will talk."</p>

<p class="regtxt9">You finished the cookie and the drink, each bite and sip bringing the world more into focus and a reduction of agony. When you were done you could see the face still imposed over the urchin. "Sister, you have broken your own laws. You have invited a Power into your city," you said.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">"Well, they are more guidelines, actually, but you are right, there will be a price, but there always is, isn't there? "</p>
