<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Hut Notes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Shandi watching the patterns as Valen controls the hut - she will start to learn majik from Zash in the library */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Shandi */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">consider - Hut has linked Valen, Krys, and Shandi through the Second Triad mechanism. at first the link only allows a leakage of string emotions or sensations. as they spend more and more time linked though this will increase until there is a usable linking between them. Valen is the most adept at this because of her previous experience linking into systems with the cyberware. she will be the first to recognize what is going on.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Great Mother - origination data */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">tom and the medics took all the bio-stuff from the labs on the way through the gate. they incorporated some of the changes made when she was modified to handle the cyberware. it gave her better immunities and recovery powers. these remain in the zeltropian gene pool. maybe use the mitochondria thing - enhanced these puppies and used them as the basis for survival enhancement in all lines. this would make it look like there was one progenitor for the race. some weird-ass type of self replicating nano-tech mixed in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the ancients found it - more specifically, Sharyl found it when she was looking for how/why the life prolongant worked. M'Lara was still around when they found out and it became the concept behind the Great Mother. Sharyl and Kayara used the genetic sims to get a look at what she would have looked like.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* shan section of hut */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">windy mountain top, grey billowing clouds and the threat of a coming storm, grass and bare rock overlooking a deep valley, a base of rock is an entrance to a cave where she has her rooms.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Living area is done in heavy, dark gothic influences. Angelique will feel right at home here.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">when asked - it speaks to the storm in my head</p>
