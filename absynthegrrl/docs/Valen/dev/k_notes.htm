<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara is half Eritsani from her mother's side. She is the heir to Dracon Pharaceuticals as well.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara had a relationship going with a planet bound lover, she wanted Kara to settle down, Kara wanted her to join her on the ghost wind. they couldn’t come to any sort of agreement and argued about it incessantly until it finally broke them up, this was about a year before Valen arrived on the scene - right now Kara is enjoying her autonomy - she will explain about this if asked but leave the gender ambiguous</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kara has lived on ghost wind for 5 years sometimes with lovers, sometimes by herself. She has some bad habits that way, such as drinking/eating direstly from containers and not needing to dress to move around the ship. She has mostly reverted to Eritsani type - a ship, with its known boundaries is far more comforting than the open, unbound space of a planet.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">most of the time when she is alone on ghost wind she will turn the gravity off and rarely wear much of anything. Once each day she’ll turn the gravity on to 1.5 normal and exercise in the gym room. She rarely hauls passengers, and if she does, she rents self contained passenger modules and installs them in the cargo section and will not actually link them into the living spaces of ghost wind - she will always charge triple rate for passenger runs</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ghost Wind need cabins for Kara/Valen, Lynn, will, Krys
corridors are stripped of coverings, with only pads where they are needed for maneuvering with the gravity off. The ship started life as one of the early DSC designs, right as they started thinking about a separable living/control module. Kara retrofitted ghost wind for this to work, increased the drives and power plant, added weapons systems, and in general made many modifications to the ship. She holds clear title to it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">her mother has almost equal influence with her father since half the money for acquiring and setting up Drakon came from her family on Eritsan. She is a highly placed member of one of the powerful Eritsani clans and this has allowed Drakon access to the imperial zones under their influence, and a substantial edge over their competitors. She is still a strong believer in the Eritsani deities and universe views. She brought Kara up as a devote of Eritsa, the goddess of change</p>

<p class="regtxt5">having gotten money through her mom for original purchase and then financing modifications in whatever ways she could.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She first saw ghost wind when it was hasklet’s pride and drifting empty. The ship she was aux pilot on was the closest to the distress call. When they arrived the ship was empty except for a very scared, almost dead kitten hiding in the galley. There was a crew/passenger module loaded into the cargo bay that was empty and blown to space. There were signs of weapons fire and blood in places but no bodies, and no sizable patches. She got money through her mom to buy the ship from the salvage yard who was going to break it down and sell it in pieces since few would buy a ship where the crew vanished. As a result she got it for a veritable steal</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The ship had ventured into the parasites sectors and run afoul of another ship - somehow all aboard were killed, except for a very frightened kitten hiding in the galley. the crew were killed because they witnessed the other ship harvesting parasite larvae and taking them aboard their ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She kept the cat and named him Mr. Jones. He likes zero g almost as much as she does, except for the cat box part, which she finally solved with a centrifuge assembly and a lot of patience on the part of Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones has been trained to climb into a pressure carrier when any of the pressure alarms go off, several carriers are placed at strategic locations throughout the ship</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She named the ship Ghost Wind because once in a while she thinks she almost hears voices from the missing crew /* might want to figure what happened to them - working on, see notes above */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">maybe scene of Lyn and Krys working on hyperdrive systems - Krys holding and acting as gopher for Lyn as she pulls things apart to fix them</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kara is ½ Eritsani from her mother’s side - lineage is tracked matrilinealy - see Eritsani file - she has a small shrine to the Eritsani goddess of changes, Eritsa, in her cabin</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kara - heiress to the Drakon Pharmaceuticals Conglomerate, rescued/helped Valen during her escape, they formed into a smuggling/shipping operation in the fringe worlds,  she couldn’t handle the image over substance things about being part of a well to do and influential family. When she went to university she was supposed to study business, but instead went for sciences and theater. She fled when her family refused to pay her tuition once they figured out what she was doing.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Insertable Segments</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are many reasons I’m alone here - one is I haven’t found anyone I want to share this space with. The other big one is I don’t want to be responsible for someone else’s well being. If something happens to me, right now I’m the only one affected. I don’t have to make payroll, I don’t have to maintain a benefits package, I only need to make enough credits to handle expenses, taxes, licenses and fees. If I had a crew then I would also have to take care of them. I don’t agree with my father’s profit above all else methods with Drakon, and I don’t want to deal with any of that stuff. That’s a big reason I don’t want you to stay  - now I have to support two of us with this ship. I can’t bring myself to just pay you as a temporary and not offer any sort of security.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* on evolution, children, and grounders */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Our species evolved in a hostile environment, so those that were best at assessing threats were the survivors. This took place over a very long time and a large number of generations. As a result, we are still wired for threat assessment, however, when a safe environment comes along, there are no real threats. As a result, threats are seen where there are none, or minimal ones at best.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The same happened with child rearing. Those that took the best care of their children survived. Now, without real threats to their ofspring, they percieve threats and dangers completely out of proportion to the reality.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Grounders have been able to create extremely safe environments, but it is making them crazy. For every safety advance, there is an even stronger need for more, driving safety into the realm of unhealthy obsession.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The Eritsani have reversed some of this, slowly, over the length of our time in the void. Those who could sacrifice their children survived. Those that sacrificed themselves for their children doomed both. As a result, we can view children as both precious and as a renewable resource. If the adults survive, there can always be more children.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* possible - for use after the hut */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">they go back to the beginnings of the Eritsani, mostly because Kara is curious:</p>

<p class="regtxt9">after thrashing around a bit and scanning records and databases to find out the correct time, they are watching the events leading up to Elena Ramachandra becoming the driving force behind the formation of the original 7 families. As they watched a shudder ripped through the station. Air, bodies, and debris blasted out from the breach into the vacuum. Kara was watching the scanners, trying to locate someone. I’ve found her, but there’s something wrong. She was found in a chamber with air, yet her locator shows her in a blown section.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">"Tyana, there’s something wrong. I found Elena’s locator, but it shows she’s in a blown room."</p>

<p class="regtxt12">I’m sorry Kara, there’s nothing wrong with the scanners. There are no life signs in that section."</p>

<p class="regtxt12">Immediately Valen was calling orders. "Tyana, tie medical link one to entrance link one, tie control link two to entrance link two, configure entrance as airlock. Target Elena Ramachandra’s locator, access station plans and jump interface to proximity with the locator." Within seconds there was the deep gong of hut activation, then another as the jump was completed. Valen was scrambling for the door and into a suit as the final gong finished chiming. Moments later she had opened the outer door and dragged Elena in. A quick look told her it was too late, but what she saw held her gaze a very long time. She reached out and cycled the airlock as she spoke, "Kara, what do you know about Elena and the beginnings of the Eritsani?"</p>

<p class="regtxt12">"I’ve told you all I know, that’s why we’re here."</p>

<p class="regtxt12">"I think you should come in here as soon as it’s clear." Valen waited the few moments as the cycle finished, then swung the hatch open. Kara stepped through and stopped as she took in the scene in the airlock. "Amazing, isn’t it? I think I know what your mother’s prophecy refers to." Kara continued to stare at her face, mirrored on the body on the floor, locked into the twisted agony of death by vacuum.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">"No...this isn’t some bad holo, it can’t work this way..."</p>

<p class="regtxt12">"Who can say...are we in a separate time stream, and so it doesn’t matter, or not...can we take the risk?"</p>

<p class="regtxt12">"No, I guess we can’t take the risk," Kara answered with a resigned shrug.</p>

<p class="regtxt12">"Tyana, monitor the rescue frequencies, we need to know how much time we have. Kara, was Elena’s body recovered at her death?"</p>

<p class="regtxt12">"I don’t know. She died in a ship, destroyed by the Groundlings..."</p>

<p class="regtxt12">"We need to get her into a freezer, and we need to get you dressed in her suit. Krys, Lynn, Will, could you grab suits and get this chamber pressurized? Help me get her into one of the freezers in medical, just in case we need her later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When I was born my mother - the wise mother of the Eritsani at the time - did a reading for me. She says I am destined for great and important things, that I will become a legend to the people. When I was younger I felt pride that I should bear such an honor. As I grew up I came to believe she was wrong. I look at my life as it was and is now and can’t decide whether to laugh or cry. Once I figured out the others around me also doubted the reading I began to hide my name.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* on simplicity */</p>

<p class="regtxt9">life was simple. Run this ship, carry cargo to make enough to meet expenses, and go pretty much where ever there was cargo. Then along comes this complication. The butcher drops in on my ship and turns my whole universe upside down. Not only is there another mouth to feed, there’s also someone with their own agenda. Could it be someone with simple needs? No, it has to be someone on the run from very serious things.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I like simplicity, that’s why I run this ship. I only have to keep the ship maintained and stocked. No worries about additional crew, a ground place, an office, or anything else. Then you come along and complicate it all up. Now there’s another person to worry about. More supplies to be bought, another person’s feelings and needs to take into account. And could I get someone simple? No, I got you. the butcher, the premiere, and a strong woman besides. What am I supposed to do with you? I tried to off-load you at the nearest port, but that didn’t work. Then I tried to leave you with your friend and that didn’t work either. Now Jones is attached to you and so am i.</p>
