<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Zeltropian Fragments</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* should have them discover the Razak ship while in orbit, also determine it is Krys and Shan's homeworld. decide why they all head down */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* coming down in the shuttle rather than the full ship - for reasons of not wanting to risk the landing of the full ship. places the crew seated closer together in a more traditional shuttle like condition */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* descent to Zeltrop */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Kara, you want to handle the descent?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, your interface gives you an edge I can't match and you've gotten to be a better pilot as well. You do it." Kara watched Valen since she had nothing to do. Her hands quivered and flexed, her eyes twitched and darted behind closed lids as she watched and manipulated controls only she could see.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A brilliant flash exploded through the view ports. Alarms sounded immediately, prsessurization first, then fire, and finally flight control. Swiftly Valen silenced them as Kara's eyes danced over her panels. The readings were crazy. Engineering, power, almost everything had suddenly gone off-line.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Warnings painted across Valen's vision as she struggled to keep the ship under control. "Damn, damn, damn. Kara, tell everyone to hang on. This is getting worse. I’ll try and set down on the ice in the mountains ahead of us, if I can keep her flying long enough." Pulses of steering jets shuddered through the ship as Valen struggled to hold attitude.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Valen twitched and shuddered as the ship jerked and screamed and the mountains raced nearer. "This is going to be rough..." Valen shouted as a peak shot past. Suddenly she was over the ice field and dropping fast. With a last command she tried to bring the nose up as the ship slammed into the ice and skated across it. They slid straight on for several seconds before something caught on the right side and spun them around. They spun like a top  until something else caught and catapulted them end over end. At last they came to a stop upside down yards away from a jutting rock face. The ship began to settle as the heat of the hull began to melt into the ice.</p>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi woke first, hanging upside down from her seat. She flipped the release and lowered herself to the ceiling. The others woke as Shandi helped each of them down. "Must go," she told each one.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Valen didn't stir when Shandi reached her. Kara carefully pulled the impant connections loose as Shandi eased her unconcious form to the ceiling. "Need Go!," Shandi repeated forcefully.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kara led the way to the airlock just aft the main cabin. The floor hatch refused to move. She motioned everyone back out of the airlock area and activated the emergency bolts. A bright flash and boom obscured the door as it flew off into the air. Shandi began shoving people toward the opening as the shuttle tilted right. Kara was pawing at the emergency lockers, trying to get them open, when Shandi grabbed her and all but threw her at the hatch. "We need the emergency gear," Kara shouted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Out, Must GO!" Shandi pushed her harder up the ladder, then shoved Valen up to Kara. She tossed Jones carrier up, and leapt up after. They scrambled off the shuttle as the ice under it let loose with a roar. Shuttle and ice crashed down into a deep cravass as they scrambled away from the edge.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How did you know?" Kara asked, completely white and shaking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just did." Shandi replied as she looked skyward briefly, then said, "Storm." She scrambled spider-like down the broken ice toward the shuttle, crawled to the open hatch, and rolled herself inside. Long moments later she emerged and tugged up a length of wire. Attached to it were the containers from the emergency locker. Swiftly she wrapped the wire around herself in a weird harness and then she clawed her way back up to the silent watchers.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi hauled herself over the lip of ice and stood. Krys stared at the purplish blood marking her handprints on the surface. "Go. Into rocks," Shandi pointed around the side of the rock the shuttle had almost smashed into. Kara started opening containers as soon as Shandi set them down. Swiftly she erected the small shelter under an overhang of the rock, powered up the stove, and started to melt ice for water. Shandi was chopping blocks of hard pack snow from the lee of the rock and piling them up to form a wall in front of the shelter. Shandi seemed unaware of the blood smears marking the blocks where she had used her hands to hack them loose.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Outside the sunlight was fading rapidly into a dim and dirty grey color. Krys was sorting food packets and everyone else was getting thermal bags open and laid out in the shelter. Most of the work took place in absolute silence except for the rising whistle of the wind. Snow puffed into the mix as Shandi was placing the last blocks. Only a few small holes were left to allow air flow. Inside the air was warming noticeably.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* armaments and Margla */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Krys threaded her way through the bustling market, stopping here and there to pick up items they might need. Finally she turned down a narrow street and made her way along the weapons venders. Quietly she spoke as they walked. "I know you aren’t familiar with these weapons, but the energy weapons we have are too obvious. Shan and I are fine, but we need more common weapons for the rest of you." At every booth she would stop and look for a moment then continue on.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What are we looking for?" Valen asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I’ll know it when I see it," Krys replied. "So far I haven’t seen what we want." They moved deeper into the shadows as the street narrowed into a dead end. At last Krys said, "This looks promising." In the darkest shadows was a small pavilion with a wizened old lady watching the tables. Displayed was an impressive array of knives, swords, and other weapons. Valen glanced at Kara, puzzled that the weapons looked no different than the ones they had passed in numerous other stalls along the way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The old woman looked up as they stopped. "Fine weapons gentle beings, the finest in Delgakar." She paused and looked up expectantly. Krys immediately began checking over her wares while Valen glanced around. Just as Krys picked up a dagger for Will Valen glanced at the old woman. There was a strange shimmering around her, almost like an electrical current and for just a moment Valen could have sworn she saw a predatory smile on the old woman’s face. When she glanced again nothing looked wrong at all.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While Krys handed the dagger to Will and had him check the feel Valen idly began looking at a daggers. She hefted one feeling its balance. The woman looked up and said, "Oh no young miss, not that one. That is not a dagger suitable to a lady such as your self. Here, let me show you something better." She reached under the table and pulled out another weapon. "This one should be more to your liking. Feel the balance, you will easily see it is better."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Valen took it from her hand and flicked it about. It fit perfectly in her hand. She was about to lay it back down, certain it was more than they wanted to spend yet she felt reluctant to let it go. "How much is this one?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"For you, the same as the others." Valen glanced at the woman, startled by this. "I’ve had that one for a while. Sometimes a weapon wants a certain owner and you’re the one for this one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Valen thought she saw the predatory smile once more flash across the woman’s face, but then Krys interrupted again. "Ok then, we’ll take it and these other items." There was a small pile of weapons including a couple of swords, three daggers, and the dagger in Valen’s hand. Krys and the woman haggled fiercely for a few moments and then the deal was concluded.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Krys, I thought you said there was no tech here," Valen commented as they threaded their way back through the market.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There isn’t, why?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I thought that woman was using some. There was something going on around her."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Woman pretty," said Shandi.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you mean pretty Shandi?" Valen inquired.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pretty. Many colors around her. She linked something. Colors from her it." Shandi blinked in confusion. "Colors us it too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* soul eater */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She swung the dagger into the first attacker. It howled in triumph as it began to feed. The target screamed in agony as his soul began to shred and Valen shrieked in agony as well as the soul of the target began to flow into her. His terror and pain washed over her leaving little of her coherent. Still she pushed back and accidentally triggered the right spell. Suddenly soul eater was sucking down the dieing man's essence instead of her. Trembling she pulled the dagger from the corpse and studied it. Gone was the plain dagger from the old woman. In it's place was a wicked curved blade set into a leering demon visage handle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She tried to open her hand to drop the hateful thing but she head a laugh in her mind followed by a mocking voice, "Oh no mistress. You belong to me now." She felt it trying to ooze its way into her and then felt its confusion as it hit the cyberware. "Mistress, what are you?" Was that fear she heard in its voice?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She smiled evilly back as she replied, "I am your mistress. I am in control here, not you." It beat against her, struggling to get a foothold, but the anti-viral software wouldn't let it. She laughed mockingly at it as she felt its fear grow stronger. "What is your purpose, servant?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Shandi on restoration */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi - "No. Not want." - she backed away</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Elentaryn - "But you could have your life back. Be free of the hut and of the nastiness that was done to you. Sweetheart, you could be your happy self again. I can get all that the monster put in you out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi - her hands moved rapidly, "Valen translate."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Valen - watching her hands moving in the complex rhythms of finger speech, "Remove it all? Including the strength, the speed, and healing? How are you going to rip the demon stuff out of me? Rebuild me in one of your tanks? Take my memory of my friends and loves?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Elentaryn - "I could try and preserve the memories. I just thought it'd make the torment less to not remember."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi - "No. Like me now." her hands spun more words, almost too fast for Valen to keep up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Valen - "I want to remember. I want to remain who I am, not let you play your games in my head. I like my strength and abilities. Don’t take them from me. Don’t take away my friends and my love." - she started to translate the last of it, but stopped, signing back to Shan instead, "He may be as much a monster, but telling him won't solve it. Get your revenge by being happy in spite of him, in spite of both of them. Talk to your mom."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Elentaryn - "Ok, but promise me you'll think about. You can let me know later."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shandi - "No, not now, not ever."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* later - after meeting ancients */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Angelique - Long life, you see the fun Stormy and Kayara have? That excitment about new things and what's going to happen next? That's the secret. Never stop enjoying it. Yhat and the love they have for each other.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Angelique - Now elentaryn, he's a different case. He lives inside his darkness and his plans so much that he can't let go. Problem is he's not happy but he just can't let go.</p>
