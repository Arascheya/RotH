<p class="pagecaption">Notes - Farni and Amanda</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">General notes:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They both like natural foods though Amanda had to be slowly introduced to them by Farni because of her background (predom. synthetic foods) she has had problems when she first found out where some of the foods came from.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Likes to do things with her hands. Still draws sometimes, will sometimes draw at craft fairs where Farni is selling her sewn goods. She likes to do beading and will often work with Farni on clothing. They work well together and are still strongly in love after 6 to 10 years together. They can often tell where the other one is and a little bit about how they are doing, don't need to talk much, favorite times at home are listening to music and quietly working on projects with the other nearby. Like most forms of music, but have a real fondness for feminist/lesbian ballads and songs. They can still talk to each other about most anything, sometimes it's hard for Farni to get started, but once she does she will spill her concerns as articulately and directly as Amanda. Both are actively involved in feminist movements, Amanda more visibly than Farni, especially after being hired by Vila. Since being hired by him, they are far less concerned who knows they are lovers, sometimes they will use it to shock people. Between them they have a fair sense of who would be dangerous to push, they have known victims of lesbian bashing, but have avoided it themselves. At home and with friends their clothing is much more relaxed and informal than the cultural norm, Amanda prefers loose jumpsuit like garments, Farni tends to favor lightweight lounging dresses/shifts.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Home: two story townhouse type arrangement, has small fenced yard/garden space, three bedrooms, 1.5 bath, kitchen, living room/dining room. Kitchen, living/dining, half bath on main floor. Upstairs has bedrooms and bath. Largest bedroom has a small balcony area, to which they have added a latticework screen and climbing plants, giving a shaded, semi-private area, great for evening relaxing. Living area has neutral carpet with small brightly colored throw rugs. Most of their furniture is wood with natural cloth fabrics, decorations tend to be natural things, including pottery and ceramics, often in earth tones. What few metal items are in gold colored metals, including a very nice freestanding brass candleholder. They have some sort of cat-like creature around the home. Plants abound.</p>
<p class="sectioncaption">World notes:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">World Name: Berzan II</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Forest world, lot of temperate climate, single continent, much water, many islands. Continent size aprox. SE asia to Turkey. One large main city with government structure, space port, and interstellar trade facilities, many small villages and towns, still has a frontier world flavor, especially in outlying areas.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Culture: narrow minded and traditional. Women are viewed as second to men. Men have perceived power. Sim. earth in seventies. Women are beginning to come on strong but still meeting much resistance from the men. Men/men relationships accepted, woman/woman relationships are not, partly from feel for need of expanding population base, partly because men cannot accept a woman not needing/preferring to have the strength of a man around.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Clothing, especially for women, stresses modesty. Any non-traditional dress is strongly discouraged, and can be grounds for termination of employment. A definite double standard exists although those in power see it only as the normal state of nature.</p>
