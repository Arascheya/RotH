<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Chapter 5</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara settled herself at the controls and began the tedious process of navigating through an unknown star system. Ten long hours had passed when she heard a thump from the corridor behind her just as she finished the orbit insertion navigation. With a softly muttered curse Valen drifted in and settled herself in the other chair. "How’s it going?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Long. Charts would’ve helped. I’m just putting us into orbit now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How long have you had Ghost Wind?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara glanced over at her. "Four years about. Why?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just thought to ease some of the tedium," Valen replied with a smile.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What else would you like to know?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know how lonely it can be in crowds, how lonely is it when you are alone?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well," Kara hesitated while Valen quietly watched her. "It can be quite lonely sometimes."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why do it then?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It’s easier than having a crew. I’d have to pay them, worry about them, and make quite a bit more per trip to support the additional financials they would cause. And I like my privacy. No arguments about how things get done."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Gods, I should have done this rather than become Premiere then." Valen laughed, "Oh well. What did you mean about the hyperdrive earlier?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The nav system reported a constraint fault. Obviously it didn’t kill us but it dropped us out here, whereever that is. The weird part is the hyperdrive didn’t complain. It didn’t register any errors at all. The nav system data dump was garbage, but the hyperdrive data was fine, although different than I expected."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Different how?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Normally there are five equations that define the way the hyperdrive system pops us into hyperspace. The data from this unit gave me fifteen equations, which is closer to the dimension set the theoretical types say make up the known universe. Much more than that you’d have to ask one of them."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Couldn’t we just take the fifteen equations for where we were, compare them to these, and use the differences to pop us home?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Theoretically yes. Problem is we don’t have the original set. They were scrambled when we jumped. Plus we wouldn’t be able to use the nav system to set up the hyperdrive, we’d have to enter them manually." Valen just sat and tapped her head. "True, that would solve the setup problems. You wouldn’t happen to have the equations rattling around in there as well, would you?" she asked smiling.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Don’t think so, but I’ll..." she stopped as a pulse flashed across her awareness. "What the..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">At the same moment the com unit crackled and voices came through on a standard com band. The language was unknown but it sounded as if the com picked it up in mid sentence. "Valen, the scanners just picked up some type of energy spike."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know, it felt like that thing on Karanal to me. Distant though..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"As far as I can tell it was on the planet below us, right about where the night terminator line is right now. That’s weird, just moments ago the scanner didn’t show anything that could account for that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Their eyes met over the consoles. "Travelers like us?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Should we go look?" asked Kara.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don’t know. We don’t have any idea of what its like down there. Do you have any way of translating their conversations?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I can record them, but Ghost Wind is a freighter, not a first contact ship. Don’t you have some sort of spy-ware or something from your spook days in that head of yours that could help?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"If you can record it I’ll try. I’ll need to move the interface card from the hyperdrive to the main system to process the recording."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Let me get this recording and I’ll get it for you."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">An hour later Valen shook her head in disgust. "No, without any common words or concepts I don't have any way to map this out. We may have to contact them and see if we speak any similar languages."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We could break into their comm transmissions or we could try and meet them."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I'd say meet them. Breaking into the comm is more likely to make them nervous. Can Ghost Wind track them at all?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Within a few zeems yes. I have some detection equipment that I use to avoid security when necessary."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Should be close enough then. If we slip in at night I can use the cyberware to find them once we are close."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How close is close enough? We're going to be pretty noisy when we set down. It'd be good if we could be away from curious eyes."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Within a ten zeems should be good enough. Not to be paranoid, but I think we should take that blaster of yours. You wouldn’t have another anywhere would you? I hate being completely vulnerable."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I can find a second one."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* entry to landing just over an hour</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on ground actions</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly they topped the rise and looked down to see the racing truck skid to a halt. Figures boiled out of the front and back, running toward the pyramid in the background. Another truck, coming fast slewed around the other and skated to a halt. Two figures leapt out the front and started firing at the running group. Thrown slugs zinged off rock and hissed into the dust.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen and Kara heard frantic conversation over the comms as the pursued group broke and darted in crazy patterns toward the pyramid opening. Two of the lead group dropped and spun. Blaster fire sizzled through the dry, hot air. One of the pursuers screamed and dropped. The second dove behind a low ridge of dirt, still firing wildly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">One of the blaster wielders dropped as a slug dug a red furrow across its scalp. The other took one look and started backing quickly toward the group just now entering the pyramid. A name and some other words cut across the chatter in the comm. Within moments they were inside. Almost at once Valen saw a brilliant flare of energy flash across the pyramid. At the same instant the conversation in the comms stopped.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Cautiously the remaining grey uniformed figure rose and began closing on the downed runner. With a quick look at Kara Valen rose slightly and fired at the nearest truck. Her blaster ripped into it and hit a spare fuel canister. A bright red flower erupted from the back of it. The startled grey uniform swung back to the truck, looking for the cause of the explosion. While he was distracted Kara slipped quickly down toward the prone figure.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She was half way to the figure when it stirred and a voice spoke through the comm. Valen lined up carefully and dropped the grey uniformed figure as Kara dashed to the slowly rising figure.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It saw Kara running and dropped into a defensive crouch. Kara slowed and holstered her blaster. She approached slowly with her hands empty and visible. The crouching figure eased into a relaxed pose and watched as Kara walked up.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen spun as a distant sound grabbed her attention. Another vehicle slewed into view. Taking careful aim she fired once more. Steam exploded from the front of it and it lurched to a stop. Angry figures boiled out the back and began firing toward her position. "Kara, not to rush you, but..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I hear them." Slowly she motioned toward the figure, making moving motions and pointing back toward the shuttle. The figure slowly reached out and touched her other hand. As she did so Kara suddenly understood what the woman was saying. "I am Krystal."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We need to go now. I have transport just behind the dune over there." Into the comm Kara said, "Valen, we are on our way to the shuttle. Cover us and fall back."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"See you soon." Valen fired carefully, more interested in forcing the hostiles to keep down than in killing them. Moving slowly she eased her way back across the sand ridge and then sprinted for the shuttle. As soon as the hatch closed behind her Kara was lifting off. They were airborn when the first of the hostiles cleared the dune and started firing at them.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen eased herself into the third chair on the flight deck and glanced at the stangely dressed woman. "If you let her touch you, you will be able to understand her. I don't know how it works, but it does." Slowly Valen extended a hand toward the seated figure.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She reached out and grasped Valen's hand.</p>
