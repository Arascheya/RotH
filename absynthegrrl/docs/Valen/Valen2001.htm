<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Chapter 1</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Valen's luck ran out at the port. They had anticipated her running for her ship if she had managed to escape the security troops in the building. The gate gard had been doubled and they were carefully checking everyone going into the private and public sections of the main port. Carefully she eased over and joined the smaller thread of traffic going around the port. She watched the fence, hoping to find a way through but it was in remarkably good repair. Ahead was the frieght terminals and the cargo ship section. For a few minutes she regretted not taking the tactical police uniform instead of street clothes when she fled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With a last look at the freight sections she drove on along the perimiter drive. On the far side of the port facility was a quiet stretch of road and a less visible section of fence. Quickly she stopped the transport and dashed to the fence. Calling up her lapsed skills once more she stared at it, unfocusing her awareness as she had learned so long ago. At last the shifting patterns of energy became visible to her. The raw red of the electricity in the fence, a more delicate mauve of sensing currents, and other, less important signals. Drawing on long dormant skills she nudged the sensing currents one way and tasted the flavor of the fence voltage.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A last look at the fence showed her barbs and razor wire woven into its fabric. She returned to the transport and sat inside. Quickly she scanned the interior looking for anything she could use to protect her hands. At last she reached under the seats and yanked out handfulls of the padding. Awkwardly she wrapped it around her hands. She sat for long moments staring out the windows as she considered her next move. With a heavy sigh she reached for deeply buried routines in her implant and triggered the combat modes. Panic siezed her as the cutouts fired, drawing her back and away from herself until she was inside, driving the body that was hers like a remote vehicle instead of herself. Immediately she began the calming mantras, not daring to use the drug treatments. She needed to remain focused.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once she was calm she stepped from the transport and dashed at the fence. The leap was adequate, but not good, another reminder that she should have kept up the physical training. She swarmed up the fence and leapt to the ground on the far side. She rolled into a laying position on the grass and quickly scanned her surroundings. Noticing the ruins of her borrowed shoes she kicked them off before rising slowly to her feet. She pumped adrenaline into the body and drove it at a dead run for the cargo docks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Dispassionately she watched varous body monitors red-line. Blood oxygen, fatigue toxins, body heating, all were reminders of how much she had let slip from inattention as Premiere. She was rewarded with a small break when the threatening clouds overhead released their load of rain. Several warnings were silenced as the blessed cooling of the water dropped the body temperatures. She knew the body was shaking when she let it stop at the buildings of the docks. Forcing it to continue moving it jerked like a badly controlled marionette around the end building to survey the ships parked beyond.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was a distressing sight. There were only five ships and four were corporates. Corporates with their elaborate security systems and armed guards. The security systems she could deal with given enough time, the guards as well, it was just too many risks.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At the far end of the row was an older ship. It's mimatched paint and worn hull let her believe it was an independent. The name, Ghost Wind, Ramachandra, confirmed she was independent and an Eritsani ship besides. That itself was an odd circumstance. Few independents, and fewer Eritsani, came to the Core Systems any more. The corporates had pretty much edged them out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Drawing on the battle tactics routines she scanned it for various signs. It looked like most of the pre flight checks and inspections had been completed. Customs locks were still in place though which argued that the crew was still negotiating cargo. For a moment she allowed herself to hope things might actually work out. The Eritsani had no love of the beaurocracy of the empire and might take perverse delight in thwarting them, even if it meant carrying the ex-Premiere as a passenger. Carefully she edged toward it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The security systems were in place and she debated using the call system to gain access. In the end she pulled up her abilities again and scanned the energies in the lock. It was an older and simpler system so it only took a few minutes and a push here and a nudge there and the mechanism unlocked for her. Inside the entry portal she followed the faint traceries of an active control system to the lighting panel. The light revealed a spotless but worn ladder leading up into the ship. A quick climb brought her to a passage leading left and right. A quick trip to the right brought her to the closed outer door of the lock. Its simple controls easily gave access to a medium sized lock with two other hatches. One hatch sat atop a short ladder, the other was to her left. Faded letters behind the ladder informed her that the crew quarters were up. Other lettering revealed the remaining hatch led to the main cargo holds.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Without thinking she keyed the crew hatch open and climbed into the shaft leading up. It was a narrow tube with the ladder rungs mostly recessed into its wall showing scrapes and wear marks of long and hard use. It was a long climb, made longer by the blaster damage to her shoulder and general fatigue, to a closed pressure hatch. It was not locked and opened to reveal a vertical airlock instead of the corridor she expected.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Elsewhere in the ship Kara awoke abruptly. She couldn't say exactly what had caused it, just that something didn't feel right. For a moment she listened and heard a distant rhythmic sound, the sound of movement where there shouldn't be any. Quickly she slipped into a caftan, grabbed her blaster, and hurried to the connecting sections of the ship.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Puzzled by the airlock Valen pulled herself onto the ladder leading to the upper hatch. It slid open just as she reached for the controls revealing a blaster muzzle and a pair of intense dark eyes in a slightly sleepy face. A cold female voice said, "OK, slowly come up the ladder." Carefully Valen moved up the ladder and into a riot of color that was the expected corridor. "Keep your hands where I can see them and move very slowly."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The figure poking its head out of the hatch in the floor wasn't what Kara had expected. The woman was dressed in soaking wet, dirt and grass stained, ill fitting clothes. Bare feet poked out through the shredded remains of socks. Twigs and grass poked out of tangled black hair. Her haughty aristocratic face was grey with fatigue yet she remained emotionless and almost disinterested in the face of a blaster muzzle. There was a curious stalking grace to her movements as she preceded Kara down the corridor. She didn't seem to notice that she was leaving wet and bloody footprints on the deck as she moved.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Combat mode held Valen still as she stared into the muzzle of the woman's blaster. The woman was tall, dark skinned and black haired. Her thin frame was wrapped in a white caftan. Cold dark eyes peered at her from the woman's rather plain face. Calmly Valen stepped into the passage and followed her requests. Tactics had already presented her with several different scenarios to disarm and eliminate the woman. She had rejected them based on needing the woman's assistance and the desire to avoid additional damage. Only if the woman refused completely would she consider killing her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A quiet hiss and thump told Valen the lock had been closed behind her. "Now, move slowly forward to the bridge, then sit in the first chair you come to. Don’t even think of touching anything." Silently Valen moved to obey. Her eyes were constantly drawn to the swirls of color splashed everywhere. Most of the cover panels had been removed from the walls, exposing the wiring, conduits and piping of the ship’s inner workings. Everything was painted and highlighted in vivid, contrasting colors.  Cushions covered in geometric patterns were attached at strategic points to provide protection from sharp corners in weightless conditions.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The bridge was also spotless and worn, the chairs exhibited more geometric patterns and wires trailed from the second pilot position to a custom console sandwiched in where the original used to be. Valen settled herself gently into the second pilot chair and took a moment to evaluate her situation. Any chance at convincing this woman to help her required normal interaction. She reached for another set of routines and ran the combat shutdown sequences. It was like swift motion from a tunnel into the sunlight as her awareness snapped back into her body. Without the combat mode she had to do fast switching on some of the pain sensors to keep from screaming. Instead she let out a low almost whimper that seemed to startle the other woman.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This is private property you know." The woman’s gaze grew thoughtful as she asked, "Do I know you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I wouldn’t think so." Something about Valen’s quiet answer brought her to lower the blaster slightly. "I’m in rather urgent need of passage to some place quiet, do you think we might arrange something?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She laughed humorlessly. "Ballsy aren’t you? You break into my ship, then sit there and calmly ask for passage? You realize this was very badly planned. They'll look here first for a fugitive. Just who are you anyway?" Shaking her head in wonder she continued to stare. "I’m sure I’ve seen you somewhere." A few more moments of staring and she continued. "You look a lot like Valen the Butcher, but that’s not very likely is it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen winced slightly at the appellation. "Fugitive...I had forgotten how that sounds." Valen reached slowly for a pocket. "I am going to hand you my ident card. I suspect I am even more of a fugitive than you expect. Please be careful how you check that. It will bring everything down on you. As it stands you might be able to lift now, before the news gets out and the lockdown is complete."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Premiere Valen? That's quite a forgery." She stared at it for long moments before the other words filtered in as well, "What news are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The news of the coup happening right now in the city. I escaped. I might be the only one that did."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara was surprised by the real sadness she saw in the woman's eyes. "It explains where I saw you before. Although..." She shook her head to clear it as other thoughts cascaded through her mind.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen watched the progress of the woman’s thoughts. Turn her in now for favor with the security forces, turn her in later for a reward, then get killed in either case because she knew too much, smuggle her out and hope she would eventually pay her, smuggle her off and kill her... The progression continued a while and then Valen broke in, "They'll kill you, you know. There's no way they can let you live knowing what has happened. Look, I’d like to let you think all this through, but I’m a little rushed."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yput kia!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You aren't unattractive. I could see doing that if it would help your decision." Valen replied calmly.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara's eyes narrowed, "You speak Eritsan?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not really, but I understand a few words, particularly the less polite ones. They sometimes get said at press conferences." Valen smiled, enjoying the look on Kara's face. "Security will be coming this way soon now I expect. Have you decided anything, or are we going to wait for them?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara turned to the control panels and called up a local news channel. A voice narrated a disturbance and lock down at the government facilities. The last part caught her attention as a recent picture of Valen appeared on the screen, "...seeking information on the whereabouts of Premiere Valen. Security forces fear she has been taken hostage and seek her immediate safe return..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Safe return? That's a laugh. I was under armed escort by the security forces prior to my escape..." Valen gave a bitter sounding laugh, "There you have it. You might get out alive if you turned me in, I doubt it though. It'd be easier to 'rescue' me if no one could say differently. Choice is yours..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why should I help you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"They will kill me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And this would be a bad thing?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It would be for me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara laughed, "Well now, you get points for that one. Nothing about the good of the galaxy, or anything like that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You have to have an ego to get where I went, but that doesn’t mean I have to believe my own PR. There will always be those better and worse. I climbed because I didn’t trust, or want, anyone else to have power over me. I didn’t do it out of some sense of higher purpose." Valen was silent for a moment and then she almost smiled as she continued, "There is a certain delicious irony in it." Her looked turned serious once more, pain showing in her eyes. "How quickly things change. For all my paranoia and distrust I never imagined a threat coming from the direction it did." She lapsed into introspective silence.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I had plans to lift tonight anyway. I haven’t found any cargo, maybe it really is time to leave." Nerves made Kara ramble a bit, "I’m going to get you out of here. I really don’t know why I’m doing this, maybe I have a think for strays..." Her voice trailed into silence then she began her checklist, commenting on what she had and how far she could go. "Well, I certainly won’t make anything on this trip, but I suppose it’s better than hanging here forever while security decides what to do. Who’d have thought, Valen the Butcher, running from her own laws..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you call me that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What, Valen the Butcher? It’s what everyone outside the government calls you, unless they’re complete suck ups. Damn, I know I'm going to regret this..." Kara reached for the com and switched it to local traffic control. "Traffic, this is Ghost Wind requesting clearance for lift."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ghost Wind, traffic, we show you waiting cargo."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Traffic, Ghost Wind, I am running short on finances and will soon be unable to meet grounding fees. I need to take my losses and seek cargo elsewhere."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ghost Wind, Traffic, understood. Please stand by there are requests to hold ships from the local port. I am checking to see if it includes you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen watched Kara with haunted eyes. "Well, this could be fun..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ghost Wind, traffic, have you seen any suspicious persons or been contacted in any way by ground personnel?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Traffic, Ghost Wind, that would be negative. I can hold while you have local staff check my com logs."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ghost Wind, traffic, that won't be necessary. Good profits to you. I am transmitting routing and lift protocols to you now. Routing codes will clear you for lift when your routing window is open." Kara shut off the com and finished her pre-flight checks. "You'll want to strap in."</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">As they cleared the atmosphere system traffic called in, "Ghost Wind, this is System Traffic, Alliance Cruiser Montemason requests you route to them for outbound clearances on transponder six-eight."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yput, what is this mishtakt?" Kara shot a nervous glance at Valen. She keyed the comm, "System Traffic, Ghost Wind, switching to new traffic routing through Montemason." She sucked a deep breath as she switched to the new channel. "Cruiser Montemason, this is Ghost Wind, calling for out bound routing as requested by System Traffic."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Stock Light Frieghter Ghost Wind, Registry number SLF 1036.807 DSC 24AE0003 this is Montemason. System Traffic shows no destination filed for your transit today. Please clarify this oversite immediately."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Cruiser Montemason, Ghost Wind, transit destination is," Kara paused for a moment and grabbed the farthest station she could reasonably make with her current fuel load. "...Teyis."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ghost Wind, Montemason, copy that. Please advise on status of cargo and passengers."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Cruiser Montemason, Ghost Wind, no cargo and no passengers at this time."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well now, that seems a bit odd. You can't make much on no cargo."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That is correct, however I was loosing too much in fees to remain so was forced to cut my losses. You wouldn't need anything taken to Teyis would you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ghost Wind I show an anomolous heat reading in your bridge area. Are you sure you have correctly declared your manifest?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara turned white as she replied, "Thank you Cruiser Montemason. This is an older ship and I was preparing to take her in for a fields allignment. Now I know why my energy use has been worse than usual. You wouldn't have someone that would like to earn a few extra credits fixing it would you?" Now it was Valen's turn to worry as the silence dragged on.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ghost Wind, Montemason, no, you may proceed. Transmitting system routing now. Good profits to you. And may your fields hold until you arrive."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Gods, you sure play it fast and loose don't you?" Valen snapped once Kara had closed the comm.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara smiled a gleeful little smile and said, "Yup. It usually works though. We are going toward Teyis, one of the outer systems. I don’t have much in the way of supplies or fuel so we will need to restock before we can go very far. It seems a good idea to get close to the edge of the Empire as quickly as possible. They’ll be sending messages about you any time now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why didn’t you shoot?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Is that what you would have done?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Would you have, really?" The woman asked, fascinated more than anything else.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Of course." Valen answered after just a fraction of a pause.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But, you’d have been curious too, wouldn’t you? That’s why I didn’t. I want to know what the real Valen is like. Not the polished image, not the portrait painted by your detractors, but the real woman known as Valen. And because I feel I know you from somewhere. You’ve done some very good things during your time in power. So I’m curious. Besides, it’s worth it to see you running from your own security forces."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You know my name, might I know yours?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Kara, it’s short for something else, but only my parents can safely use it. I suggest you sleep now, we will be arriving at Teyis in ten hours and who knows how our reception will be. If we have really good luck we can get restocked and be out before they have word of us. You set all this up, how organized are the port authority groups anyway?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Not as well as I wanted yet. The hypercomm gear is very expensive and only installed in critical places so far, mostly in the Core Systems. I don’t think there’s a system at Teyis yet. I never thought I’d be happy the upgrades had gone so slowly."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"For all you government types believe, anarchy and disregard have their benefit." There was only the slightest hint of mockery in her voice, but still Valen started to bristle at it until she reminded herself that Kara had just gone illegal to keep her alive. That thought roused something deep inside, something she hadn’t wanted to think about in a very long time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara led her to a spare cabin, containing a small sleeping pad and desk unit. "I apologize for the sparseness, but I don’t make it a habit to haul passengers, so..." She stopped abruptly when she saw the dark rusty patch on Valen’s shirt as she moved into the room. "Why didn’t you say you were hurt?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Come with me." Kara pulled Valen back out of the room and back down the corridor, finally pausing to open a different door. Beyond was a cramped medic station. "On the bed." After a bit of rummaging through various cabinets Kara efficiently cut up the back of Valen’s borrowed top and exposed the damage to her left shoulder. "Damn, you call that nothing?" A three centimeter by ten centimeter patch of skin had been burned away. Along the center of the burn up to 3 millimeters of muscle tissue had also burned off. Charred flesh had cracked and was oozing blood and plasma.
</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just clean it and slap a bandage over it. It’ll be fine. Really, it isn’t that bad."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shaking her head mutely Kara began working carefully but quickly, cleaning the burn of as much dead tissue as she could. Next she applied antibiotic burn treatment, pulled it together with a several sterile strips, and covered it over with a clean gauze pad. It wasn’t until she was done that she realized Valen hadn’t made a sound throughout the procedure. She was going to ask Valen how she had ignored the pain, but noticed she had either passed out or was asleep. For a moment Kara considered trying to wake her, then realized she wouldn’t be able to do anything more even if Valen was unconscious. While Valen was down she also cleaned and checked her feet. Most of the damage was small scratches and bruising. They would hurt but they weren't threatening like the shoulder wound.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Nightmares chased each other through Valen’s dreams as she lay on the table. Most of them involved running down a narrow, dark hallway being chased by something she couldn’t see. Once in a while dreams of blaster fire and pain broke the monotony.</p>
