<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Chapter 3</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They talked a bit more but could come to no solid ideas. Tom still had some doubt about the situation and Kara and Valen didn’t have enough knowledge of the facilities to have any meaningful suggestions. When their conversations would lapse his comment would play again in Valen’s mind, ‘Premier Valen isn’t safe here. There are a great many people here who would like nothing more than to turn her over for the reward.’ She hadn’t really realized until then that there was no place she could go where she wouldn’t be recognized by almost everyone in the Empire.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Their conversation had lapsed into talk about his daughter’s progress in Space Fleet by the time Elentaryn arrived looking more rumpled than usual. His hair hadn’t seen a comb in several days and his face showed a serious lack of sleep. As soon as he saw Kara his face lit up with a huge smile. A quick bound brought him to her and he bent down, sweeping her into a huge hug, then straightened and commented, "You’re looking well. How are things? Still travelling around by yourself in that rust bucket of yours? Hey Mr. Jones!" He swept an appraising glance over Valen, grabbed Jones from an empty chair, and cuddled him tight. Jones gave a long look of forbearance and suffered through it until he was released. He stalked back to his carrier and began to repair his ruffled dignity. "Premier! This IS a surprise! The last we heard you were running for your life. Now, what is this situation?" Quickly they outlined what had happened.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I find it hard to accept the Razaks as part of this either. They’ve been used as the bogeyman for too long for me to really take them seriously. Your security group on the other hand seems to possess your ruthlessness without any of your charm or social grace. I don’t feel any good will come of this  ‘inspection’. Which brings us to the problem of what we should do. Leaving has a lot of problems associated with it. There are several thousand people at this facility. That’s a lot of people to move in less than three days, even if they were ready and prepared to go. Given the feelings many of them have for being sequestered here, any plan that would force them even further away won’t go over well at all. If we can’t present something more concrete than just rumors of the bogeyman, then I don’t think we’ll be able to persuade anyone to evacuate. Staying leaves us at the mercy of the inspection team and their armada of battle cruisers."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I can’t give you hard proof. I did not actually see any. Even if you are right though, I don’t think they have any intention of letting anyone leave here alive. It’s my feeling that they want the information from here, but don’t want any risk of someone else getting it. What more can I do to convince you other than mention the formation of cruisers inbound right now..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Premier, I agree with you about the danger. What we will need though, is a way of convincing a large part of the rest of the people here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You know, what I’d do in your position? I’d gas down any non-security personnel and deposit them on transports out of here. Those that I couldn’t gas, I’d ‘arrest’ and load onto ships. Those I knew would be willing to leave without persuasion I’d deputize and use to help move the others. The situation doesn’t allow many options. We have three days at the most." Kara stared at Valen, Elentaryn looked scandalized, and Tom was trying hard not to laugh.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That is rather more direct than I would want to get Premier. I’m glad you no longer have the authority to demand that type of action."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Fine Elentaryn, let them land, welcome them with open arms, then watch as they annihilate you. Just remember as they do that you will have delivered to them the means to destroy every last vestige of the Empire."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You are over-reacting!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Am I? Maybe, but are you really willing to risk it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Premier, Elentaryn, your arguments are interesting, but we don’t have enough ships to even begin to move our personnel. We could evac maybe one thousand if we packed every ship, fighter, and cargo vessel we have stationed here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Elentaryn was looking smug as he replied, "Oh, we could get everyone off. We could just run them through the experimental gate we have down in the lab. It seems to create the same effect as a hyperdrive unit, only this one allows things to go through it without requiring the protective fields needed in hyperspace. There’s already an outpost/research station on the other side. All we’d have to do is walk people into the gate. We could clear them through as fast as we could line them up. Problem is someone would have to stay behind to shut down and purge the systems, otherwise they could just follow along behind us."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How long have you had this ‘gate’? Just who do you think you are not to let anyone know what you are playing with here? Who do you think funds this place of yours? Do you think this is your own private playground??" Anger snapped and crackled in the coldness of Valen’s voice.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Stuff it! You aren’t in charge any more and it’s done and over with." Elentaryn was leaning forward matching her anger for anger.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"HOLD IT you two," They both swung to glare at Kara. "It seems once more that things have worked in your favor. There’s nothing about this ‘gate’ in your system on Centralys, so your security people won’t know about it either. Now if you two could quit arguing long enough to come up with a plan."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The comm beeped for attention again. "Commander, we’ve just had an incident. One of the supply ships was headed out. When it neared the incoming fleet they launched several missiles. The ship was destroyed almost instantly. Within moments we received the following transmission," A recorded voice came on then, "Karanal Research Facility, I am Commander Alester. As of this moment you will consider yourselves under security quarantine. I am authorized to use whatever force is necessary to maintain this quarantine until the evaluation group has arrived at your facility. Please make no attempts to leave your system. Once again, I have been authorized to use whatever force is required to enforce this order."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sergeant, issue immediate orders that no one launches until further notice. Then inform the fighter battalion to go to alert status."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Well this puts a new twist on it." Elentaryn said thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"More than you know! Commander Alester was assigned to the containment zone command. If he is here then someone has dissolved the containment force and re-deployed them. Normally the only people who could do that would be Space Fleet high command or myself." Valen added.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It seems you might be right after all about the danger here. We can use this as part of our arguments for evacuation. I’ll assemble the senior staff immediately. Commander, you might want to get your people ready." Elentaryn rose and started for the door. Then he turned back, "Was there anything else? If not, we had best get moving on this. I’ll see if I can find a few volunteers to remain behind and shut down the gate after us." Then he was gone.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You know, it always amazes me how quickly he can come to a decision and start in with it." Valen mused.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"His father told me he was like that, I never actually observed it though."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Tom, do you have any suggestions on how to get Kara and her ship out of here? Unless she wants to throw in with us..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Valen, listen to me. You are NOT safe here. Now, even more than before, when Elentaryn rams this evacuation down everyone’s throats they are going to want a scapegoat. Who better than the person responsible for them being here in the first place? There is no way we can keep you safe. It would be better for you to try and escape the blockade."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Valen, I’m not staying. I can take you out of here, if you want?"  Turning to Tom she continued, "Commander, we should be going now, before the fleet has any more time to set up a proper blockade."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No." Valen was as surprised as they were that she had spoken. "I will stay and shut this place down."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Now it was Kara’s turn to stare as Tom asked why.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don’t know anything about this place. If any of you were captured, they would get quite a bit from you. I can make sure they won’t get anything from me. Even if they do capture me, I won’t be able to tell them anything useful."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara rose to leave, "I guess this is goodbye then. I really had hoped to deliver you to safety. And get them to get you medical attention for that burn."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You take care getting out, it still won’t be as easy as leaving Centralys. Make sure and take care of Mr. Jones."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tom turned to Valen, "What burn?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"She has a bad blaster burn on her left shoulder, compliments of the coup. Don't let her talk you out of fixing it up for her." Kara walked over to Jones’ carrier and tapped on the side, calling his name. When that had no effect she walked to Valen and reached to lift him off her lap. The harder she tried the more he protested. He was still yowling in frustrated rage as she stuffed him into the carrier and headed out the door.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen stared at the door behind her, surprised that she was actually missing her, until she heard Tom ask, "Are you sure about this?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. Now, are you going to call Elentaryn or aren’t you? He needs to know so he can make his plans."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With a sigh and a look of resignation he turned back to the comm panel. "Then I’m going to set up an appointment for your shoulder."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Be careful who it is with, remember?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"How could I forget? I know just the med-tech to send you to."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A few minutes later Elentaryn walked in and immediately called up a general plan of the facility. "We will have three days to brief you on the details of the shutdown. You will have to shut down the gate, purge all computer records, shut down the computer systems, shut down facilities power, and finally destroy enough of the power control equipment to make it impossible to bring the power back up. All copies and backups of the research data will go with us through the gate. We are using a new power technology that taps the energy from the planetary core, so once the control equipment is destroyed, it would be extremely difficult for someone else to re-engineer the necessary components. The computer systems are also odd enough that the same should be true. Once everything is shut down get the hell out of here. We will try and give you at least three hours before the fleet arrives. I hope you remember enough of your ship training to make it." Then he turned once more to Tom and they began planning the actual evacuation.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen’s mind was wandering as they continued their discussion. It still surprised her that Kara had just up and left. Some crazy part of her brain had hoped she’d stay and they could escape together. With her gone, there was no way she was going to be able to escape. She could manage fairly simple piloting, but doubted she’d be able to avoid the blockade. It took several tries before Elentaryn’s question penetrated her fog. "Universe to Valen, come in Valen... nice of you to come back to us. What are your thoughts on this quarantine fleet? Do you think they’ll prevent traffic from here to the planet?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Quarantine...ummm...Probably, once they get close enough. If I were in charge, I certainly would. I’d want to keep you as far off balance as I could, kind of soften you up for the investigation group."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Then our first problem is getting everyone out of here in the next few hours..." Immediately they turned back to the planning board they had been working at.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She drifted back into chewing on all the changes that had happened in the last few days. Lost in thought, she didn’t hear the knock at the door. Instead she heard Elentaryn’s annoyed, "Come in," and turned to look just as Kara walked in with Jones. Valen’s face broke into a smile before she even realized how happy she was to see her again. "Mr. Jones wouldn’t let me walk away. Besides we haven’t settled up yet. Nice try, but you promised to make it worth my while. I’m not leaving until you do." Kara sounded annoyed, but there seemed to be a faint smile playing around her lips. Jones banged insistently on the door to his carrier until Kara released the latches. Then he was out and purring loudly as he toured the room before leaping into Valen’s lap and curling up. His purring increased when she reached down and absently rubbed his head and scratched behind his ears.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Elentaryn wiped the silly grin off her face and grabbed her attention again when he asked, "There is one thing here we haven’t looked at. How are we going to keep Valen safe while showing her how to shut this place down?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Kara and Valen already had that worked out. If I hadn’t known her as well as I did, I might have been fooled by her masquerade as Kara’s cousin. I think we should keep that going. It should work for the three days we need. You and I will just have to be very careful not to slip and we’ll want to keep her as isolated as we can. From this point she is Ettaleiya Andreskova and she is mute. Premier, I don’t suppose you know signing?" Valen almost spoke, then shook her head instead. Her part wasn’t going to be very easy either. "Too bad, it would have greatly aided the charade. Kara, did your cousin use a voice synth or something similar?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sometimes, but not very often. She didn’t like the way they sounded. Mostly she signed, or used a note unit when she needed to use actual words for clarity. For technical discussions she would often rely on the note unit to make sure her meanings were clear. I can show her some signing, it'll be very limited, but it should be enough for show."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why didn’t she just get her voice fixed? It’s a simple procedure these days."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It still costs money, Elentaryn. If it’s the difference between hyperdrive maintenance and a voice repair, the maintenance wins every time. Besides, she was mute from birth and never indicated she missed it. She is used to the note unit and using sign language among family"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Elentaryn sketched a quick time line as the planning meeting resumed. Details were deliberately left sketchy on the parts more distant. Most of the attention was focused on getting everyone from the station to the planet’s surface before the quarantine fleet arrived. Mostly it was determining in what order to remove particular personnel and functions. Tom wanted to leave things looking as normal as possible, for as long as possible. His concern was if things seemed too wrong that the fleet would send fighters ahead to maintain current conditions. They eventually agreed on a compromise and moved on to setting down the evacuation order.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We’ll ship you down with some of the non-essential personnel as one of the first ships. That way we can get Ghost Wind out of sight in one of the protected areas before too many people now she’s here. After that, it would be best if the two of you stayed out of sight until we arrive. There’ll still be plenty of time to go over the specifics. Kara, make sure Valen shows up at medical tomorrow at 1000 hours for her shoulder. I don’t think she was paying attention when I told her a while ago."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara was silent all the way back to the Ghost Wind. As soon as the hatch closed she started in on Valen, even before they reached the bridge. "What were you thinking? It would have been suicide!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe, but what do you care? I thought you wanted to get clear of me as quickly as you could. Besides, it’s not like it’s the first time I’ve faced death. After a time you accept the risk or you remain paralyzed."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara stopped, shocked, wondering to herself why she did care. "I - uh - I promised you safety. I like to honor my debts. Besides, Jones wouldn’t leave me alone about it. I think he might have missed you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Jones, would have missed me..." Valen was trying hard not to smile as she said it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, Jones. He’d never forgive me if I left a job half done or ran off without getting my pay. You couldn’t let me collect my pay and leave in peace, could you?" Her tone was serious, but there was a small smile playing around the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you. I’m glad you came back. I would have missed him too." Valen replied with quiet sincerity.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You had the right to ask."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know, but I won’t force someone into danger if I don’t have to. I never have before, I won’t start now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara looked thoughtful once more. Again Valen had surprised her. "Guess I needed more excitement before I went back to running freight."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Loading the ship took very little time. Soon they were arriving on Karanal and moving the ship to a protected section of the landing zone. They were assigned a guide as soon as they entered the complex that took them to their assigned quarters.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen occupied herself at the room’s terminal for several hours, checking out the facility and what was available on the easy access parts of the network. First she worked her way through the general information then she composed a list of items and sent it to Tom, asking that it be delivered to Ghost Wind. Kara turned on the entertainment unit and lost herself in a vid she hadn’t seen in a while. Jones curled up on Valen’s lap and napped while she searched. When Valen was finished she was about to announce to Kara that she was hungry. Catching herself just before speaking, she waved instead, then made motions of eating. "Hungry?" Kara asked. She nodded yes and started for the door, just remembering to pick up her note unit.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hold on a minute. I should get something myself. Jones, you stay here and keep an eye on things. We’ll bring you something back."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen and Kara were walking down one of the corridors leading to the dining hall when a small group entered their corridor from a side one. Two men moved quickly to Kara and threw her against the wall, hissing, "We heard she was here. You should die for being with her." A third man yelled, "Die, Butcher!" and swung a chunk of pipe into the back of Valen’s head. Instantly she crumpled as the group took off at a run.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara shakily moved to Valen, sure she would find her dead. She bent down to look and then bent to look closer. The skin on Valen’s head was torn and pulled away from the skull underneath but the skull appeared undamaged. She moved closer, reaching to try and stop the bleeding, when Valen groaned and rolled over. "Damn, that hurts." She said as she slowly eased herself upright, rubbing her elbows.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Quiet!" Kara hissed, then continued, "Stay put! I’ll get a medic. You shouldn’t even try to move with that kind of injury."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen reached up and pulled Kara close and hissed back, "NO, no medics. Can’t let them scan me. Your cousin couldn’t afford what I have." She reached up, felt her head, pulled back bloody fingers and grimaced. "Get me to our room. I’ll explain it when we are safe."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara watched helplessly as Valen slowly stood and then tried to walk on her own. "Alright, at least let me help you." Kara responded as she grabbed Valen’s arm, dropped it across her shoulder, and walked her toward their rooms.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara paced the room as Valen sat on the bed and watched her. "You’ve got to get that closed up."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen motioned her over and pointed at her wound while whispering, "Butterfly it with a few bandages. Then it’ll keep until tomorrow." Then she motioned around the room where only Kara could see her hands. "This place is probably wired. I’ll tell you the rest of it when we’re back on Ghost Wind. For now, act like it’s normal for me to not take care of myself."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"ALLRIGHT! I’ll fucking bandage it for you. You always were the stubborn bitch when it came to yourself." She stalked over to her gear, not having to pretend anger, and pulled out a small med kit. Snatching up a few bandages she stalked back to Valen and tore them open. Valen’s hiss of pain cooled her irritation somewhat. "See? You are hurt." She proceeded more gently until she had pulled the torn flaps of skin back together. "I know you don’t trust medics, but they’d do a much better job of this than I’m doing."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once she had finished she went alone to the nearest dining area and ordered a couple of meals to take back to their quarters, arriving back about the same time as Tom showed up. "Elentaryn and I just arrived. I thought I’d check on you two before I get sucked back in to the evacuation situation." He entered behind her and stopped short as he took in the bandages on Valen’s head. "What happened here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Someone thought Ali was the Butcher. They decided not to wait and find out and took a swing at her."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You are going to medical, right now." Valen started to balk. "No, right now. Otherwise I call security and get you an escort." Valen slumped in defeat as Tom reached to pull her up.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"See, I’m not the only one!" Kara flashed her a triumphant grin. Tom turned and quick-marched them to the medical area and turned her over to the medic he had recommended.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I thought I was supposed to be fixing a burn."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen pulled out her notepad and quickly typed, "There’s a burn also. We had a bit of trouble during transit and I bumped my head too."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’m definitely going to have to scan that head wound."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No, just stitch it up and work on the burn."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Commander Torzelth explained you wouldn’t want to be scanned. For the burns it wouldn’t be necessary, but a head injury is very different."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I waive my right to prosecution and refuse scanning. I have the two witnesses right here. There, now you are covered." Valen smiled as she typed the last bit.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I could refuse to treat you as well. That’s within my rights." He looked at Tom for support but instead received a shake of the head. "Very well, I’ll treat you, but it will be under protest."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara and Tom just rolled their eyes and looked at the medic. Kara commented, "You get used to her after a while. She really does have redeeming qualities, at least that’s what we keep telling ourselves..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The medic pulled the bandage off and took a careful look at the butterfly closures underneath. Then carefully pulled them off, explaining as he did that he needed to check for cleanliness and damage. Once he had all the butterflies off, he gently pulled the skin flaps apart and looked into the injury. Then he stopped and looked again, "No wonder you weren’t too worried. It looks like Synth Bone 87a, but the flesh is attached much better than I’ve ever seen with it." Kara turned to stare also.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen typed, "Not exactly. It was something that was laying around when I took a bad hit to the head." Carefully he stitched it closed and bandaged it. Then he turned to the burn. Stripping the dressing away, he moved Valen over to a burn tank. As he examined it he commented, "I understand I can only keep you twenty hours. With luck that will be almost enough time for the healing stimulant to get things going. You'll still need to be careful with it for another week."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Since she has arrived early I can let you have her for twenty-four hours instead." Tom added.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Twenty-four hours later Tom arrived just as Valen was emerging from the tank. "I wish you could come. It won’t be the same without you. Besides, who’ll keep you out of trouble now?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I can’t. I clawed my way to power to see if I could and for other selfish reasons. Problem is once I got there I began to feel responsible. I wanted to make things better. I have to try and make things right, undo some of the damage. I can’t just walk away like I thought I could. Things are bad now and going to get worse. I need to work to change that."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I should stay and help..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"No! These people need you more. Elentaryn is a brilliant scientist and a capable administrator, but he isn’t a leader. These people need a leader to survive." Valen stopped and stared into his eyes. "I’m going to miss you, Tom. I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t been there every time I needed someone. You’ve saved my life more times than I can count. And you kept me sane when things went really wrong. I couldn’t ever repay that, even if you stayed."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Please, do me a favor - look after Dorotea. She’s in Space Fleet somewhere. I haven’t heard anything from her since this mess started."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I will." She raised a hand to his cheek and softly touched it. "Don’t forget me, ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Impossible," He replied with a sad smile.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">He escorted her to a conference room, stopping long enough on the way to collect Kara. Elentaryn already had the facility plans and evacuation time-table called up on the monitors. The briefing was detailed and complex. At the end a checklist was loaded into Valen’s note unit. When they were finished Elentaryn led the way down to the portal facility. It was buried deep under the complex, carved out of the bedrock of the crust. He explained it was the only way to ensure the stability the equipment required.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As they approached the gate area Valen slowed as the pulsing currents and fields flashed swirls and patterns across her senses. It took more and more of her concentration to block enough to see the corridor down which they were moving. As they rounded the last corner it flared into hot, white brilliance. She stood clutching the doorway for long moments before she could manage to damp it down enough to move toward the control area. The pain from blocking the energy images had tears streaming down her face by the time they reached the control area. Kara watched intently as one by one the long column of people filed through the gate. Valen kept her eyes closed until Kara finally said, "The last ones are moving through now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen managed to pry her eyes open long enough to see that Tom was the last one through. He hesitated a long moment, turned, waved at Valen before marching resolutely into the globe. "There goes one of the best friends I’ve ever had." She commented as she closed her eyes once more. "Let me know when the delay time has passed." She focused her thoughts on memories of Tom and for a while it helped keep her mind off of the titanic energies surging in the center of the room.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara pulled her back with, "Time to get on with it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Can you do this part, I can barely concentrate enough to talk."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What’s wrong?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’ll explain once we’re done here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">With a concerned look at Valen Kara slowly began the gate shutdown. When the globe of energy collapsed, Valen slid down the wall with it. For many moments she sat there cradling her head in her hands before looking up and asking, "Is that it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, now it’s on to the main systems. Are you ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I am now. I can sense energy patterns. Sometimes I can even influence them. That thing they walked through was just entirely too much all in one place."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"So that’s how you got on my ship." Kara commented as she began reading from the instructions on Valen’s pad until Valen stopped her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just a minute, I need to do something first." She pulled open drawers and cabinets until she found a datapack then slipped it into the socket. Next her fingers flew across the terminal as she called up section after section until she found the personnel records. Scanning quickly she finally found one she seemed to like and transferred the file to the datapack. "I need to change identities. To do that I need to replace my identifying data with someone else’s before creating an identity with mine. Who could be better than someone who will never be seen in this area again? Ok, let’s get this done."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara read the list of instructions from Valen’s notepad and Valen performed the required tasks. The first hour wasn't bad, the main lights were still on and the procedures dealing with the computer shutdown were tedious, but relatively easy. The erase on exit program appeared to clean out everything as it shut down. To make sure they tried to restart the system and received the message, 'BOOT FAULT: Install Operating System Load Module and RESTART.' Exactly what Elentaryn had told them to expect.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Next came the shutting down of the facility power. Soon the corridors were lit only with dimly glowing emergency lighting. The quiet and dark quickly turned oppressive as they made their way down to the core tap control center. It was located a quarter of a mile away from the main facility and three hundred feet down. On the way to it they were able to use the cargo elevator to get down to the control section. Then came the last steps of shutting down the core tap power generator and destroying the control systems. And then it was finished.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">During the long walk back Kara began her questioning of Valen. "Now why can’t you let a medic scan you?" Valen hesitated long enough that Kara continued, "Look, I know enough to bury you as it is. I’ve come back for you once, why do you fear me so?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Trust is something I’m just not good at." Valen took a deep breath and continued, "There’s cyberware in my head. It’s heavily screened and most of the time not detectable, but they would have seen it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Cyberware? Ghost Wind would have detected it. Besides..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It’s illegal, I know. That’s why it’s screened as well as it is. How else do you think I survived that blow? He hit me hard enough to split my skull like an over-ripe melon."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Cyberware? How much? Are you still..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Human? I think so. There is still quite a bit of brain tissue left, although I ask myself that question often. I know I lost things when it happened. At first I would reach for something, a memory, a thought, and it wouldn’t be in my mind anymore. Like things you’ve forgotten, but remember that you knew once. I don’t know how much I lost. Most of the damage was to motor control and life support sections of the brain, but there was tremendous overall trauma. Tom helped a lot, especially the first few years. He knew me before and after the event and I relied on that knowledge. I think it’s one of the things Amanda couldn’t deal with at the end. Sometimes I feel like she never felt sure of what I was, or wasn’t."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"When did you get it? WHY did you get it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"When I was in university I suffered serious brain injury."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Why not just have them give you re-growth treatments?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know what happens if the wrong re-growth cell culture is used? It begins to destroy the healthy tissues around it. There wasn’t enough time to try again and my...father...was able to get the cyberware."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There’s a lot more to the story than that, isn’t there?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It’s a long, weird story. I’m not sure I’d believe it if someone told it to me."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We have plenty of time. Besides, I’d like to hear it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"If you’re sure..." Not hearing anything more from Kara she launched into the tale.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"I was born on Aristaleez Prime. I don’t know how much you know about Aristaleez, but there are several different classes of people there. The locals are basically the lower class. They aren’t allowed near the actual university complex, or near the main ports. They are paid a pittance wage and function in most of the lower jobs."</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"My father was an information acquisitions agent, a data thief. The sad part was he really wasn’t any good at it. My sister and I were the two in the family who really understood data systems and security protocols enough to actually get into places. He just had the contacts to get jobs. My brother provided backup muscle for him. He wasn’t a nice man. He beat my sister and I. The severity depended on how quickly we picked up on what he wanted. She handled all the really hard stuff and I was supposed to learn from her. He rushed her on a particularly dangerous job and she was killed when a defense device blew up. He expected me to replace her."</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"Anyway, my schooling was done at home, always under his watchful eye. When I was just about the same age as the off-worlders attending Aristaleez Polytechnic I was granted a bit more time to myself. I was supposed to be forming my own contacts and getting more work for my father. What I was actually doing was slipping out for long walks near the university and later onto its grounds. It would have been bad if I had gotten caught. Locals weren’t supposed to be on campus except as delivery and support people."</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"Ok, here’s where it starts to sound even more like bad entertainment. During my wanderings I met and became friends with one of the off-world students. Her name was Sara and we looked almost identical to each other. I guess it was one of those weird flukes of the universe, like your cousin and I looking similar. We became good friends. She hated being confined to the campus almost as much as I resented being barred from it. For that summer we went a lot of places together. She’d slip me into places on campus and I’d show her around the local areas."</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"That fall a lot of things came to a head. I found a way to escape my father. He had a job that required he and my brother to slip into a data warehouse and swap some backup media. My job was to crack the security and monitor their safety. Once they were in the vault I sealed it and triggered the alarms. Then I left, backing out of the building and triggering everything on my way out. I had planned to borrow a set of clothes from Sara and fade into the farm worker force outside the city."</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"I slipped onto campus my usual way and was heading to Sara’s room when I found her. Someone had carved her up really badly and left her in our favorite spot by the river. She lived long enough to tell me who. I decided I would masquerade as her long enough to trap the sorry piece of shit, since only he and I knew I couldn’t be Sara. Tom was Sara’s only other friend at the time and he knew something was wrong as soon as he saw me. We formed a pact to expose Sarah’s killer. He saved me. If he hadn’t helped it never would have worked."</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"I flushed the killer, but in the process he clubbed me down, very much in the same way as was tried here. Since the school thought I was Sara, thanks to some careful data replacement, they called her parents, who dashed to the rescue. They immediately tried brain re-growth using cultures from their real daughter and, of course, I went into severe rejection. Sara’s mother figured it was mishandling at the storage site, her father figured out the truth and confronted me. He agreed to let me go if I would let him test his newest cyberware in my head and also function as a spy for him. He was one of the engineers who worked on the Jaranthas experiments. I’m sure you heard of that disaster. He needed to prove the newest changes solved the problems to keep his funding going. We came to an agreement, I got the cyberware and my life, he got a spy placed in the Aristaleez intelligence training center and a test-bed for his latest and greatest."</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"Things went well for a couple of months and I met Amanda while attending the intelligence school. Then came the cyber-wars of 3078. One of the first targets was my...father’s...facility. There were no survivors. Then the great cyberware purges followed. Tom helped me hide my status and together with Amanda we got through the training program."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen fell silent. After a few minutes she turned to Kara, "Now it’s your turn. Are you the Kalimayani Karakinska who is set to inherit Drakon Pharmaceuticals?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I am."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Then why are you running a tramp freighter in the fringe?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Similar reasons to you, oh Premier. I was fleeing for my sanity, rather than my life, but that’s about the only difference..."</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"I am Eritsani on my mother’s side, yet as I was growing up my father was constantly pressuring me into company affairs and politics. I learned more about reading and mathematics from the company reports and books than I did from formal schooling, or so it seemed at the time. I was trotted around at the social gatherings and introduced to all the right people. From the time I could hold my own in polite company I was expected to assume the roll of heir apparent and learn the posturing necessary to hold control. Most of what my family does to maintain control of Drakon has nothing to do with actual skill at running the company. No, control was retained by how my family appeared to the stock holders and other functionaries inside and outside of the company. Most of the high level policies are decided at the social gatherings. I just couldn’t take it. I am Eritsani. We decide things based on skill and capability. It doesn't matter who you know if you can't save the ship in an emergency. I couldn't make myself blend into the places where who you knew and how you looked in fancy dress determined your status."</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"When it came time for me to attend university my father sent me off to one of the better business universities and enrolled me in the business admin program. It was also my first space voyage and it awoke the Eritsani longing in my blood. You spoke of your craving for Frost Lichen, imagine that severely magnified and you have my need to be in space. I lasted one semester in the business admin program before I changed my major to engineering and started toward a degree in starship design. For two years I was able to keep my father from finding out. Then one of his friends saw the engineering honor roll with my name in the list. My father came to visit and informed me that unless I remained in the business degree classes he would demand a refund of my tuition and have me shipped home. I didn’t really believe him until I went in to change classes and received the same warning from the admissions and records director. It seems Drakon made sizable contributions to the school operating budgets and it was hinted about that those could suffer reduction if there were difficulties."</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"I took off at that point and went down to the star port where I prowled from bar to bar until I found an Eritsani crew that would take me. Mostly I think because I was of the blood and Eritsani always helps Eritsani. It wasn’t a very good job. Mostly I ran a loader and cleaned up the ship, but it got me into space and gave me a chance to study and learn. That lasted about six months until my father’s hired trackers found me. The crew caught wind of the hunt in time and spirited me away to another ship."</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"From there I hopped Eritsani ships whenever my father’s hunters came too close. All the time I was studying until I could take the basic exams for apprentice engineer and captain. It came fairly easily and I was almost ready to qualify as captain in my own right when the ship I was on came across this ship, drifting, empty. Her emergency transmitter was sending, but she was blown mostly to space. The only section still sealed included the galley and a very scared kitten, Mr. Jones."</p>
<p class="regtxt9">"Working with my mom I was able to purchase the ship from the scrap yard that had bought her at auction. No one wanted to ship out on a derelict, plus she is really old, one of the original DSC designs, so she was really cheap. I managed to pay back most of what I borrowed from mom and she has forgiven the rest. I completed my exams for Master of Starship and went on to form a small company. For once I was making the grade on my own."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"This cyberware, what does it do for you anyway?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Mostly it keeps me alive. It replaces the back of my brain, brain stem, and most of my spinal chord. It gives me a better memory and it enhances my reflexes a bit. The best part is it gives me a way to direct interface to just about any computer system I encounter."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What’s it like?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don’t know how to answer that. It’s been a part of me for so long I can’t remember what it was like without it. It’s changed me, I’m sure of that, but since parts of my brain were gone anyway I can’t be sure how. Direct interface is even harder to describe. It allows interactions with systems at a more direct level. I don’t need to translate data on a screen into thoughts and then back to keyboard style commands. If you’ve ever tried the military thought interfaces, its like them, only orders of magnitude better. I could show you images of what it can look like, but I don’t know how to describe how it feels."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">Silence had descended on the complex. Just days ago it had been alive with the sounds of people hurrying from place to place, carrying files and personal items. Now it was silence and open doorways. It was the first time Valen had ever encountered so much quiet. The last five levels were the longest. Some of the emergency lights had failed early. There were only a few pockets of glaring white light between long stretches of inky blackness. She fought her fear of the dark closed spaces as best she could but Kara would hear a sharp hissing breath any time she was startled. She was dripping sweat and white by the time they reached the upper sections.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When they finally arrived at their temporary quarters Jones was pacing the room and yowling for all he was worth. As soon as he saw them he dashed into his carrier and pawed at the door, meowing urgently. Fears began to spider crawl up and down Valen’s back, feeding her already heightened fear, as Jones grew more frantic. She grabbed Kara’s hand and dragged her into the corridor. Soon she was running as fast as she could for the Ghost Wind, Kara staggering along behind her, Jones’ carrier thumping against her leg as she ran. "Come ON! Hurry up! Jones is right, we need to get out of here right now." It seemed to take hours to run the distance to the complex entrance and then to Ghost Wind.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara’s eyes glistened with excitement as she began lift off. All the while running through maneuvers she might want Valen to try when they reached the blockade. Once they cleared the atmosphere Kara headed to the weapons, leaving Valen in charge of flying again. Kara quickly over-rode Valen’s protests of little ship experience with, "You were doing really well the last time we did this. Just do whatever was working then and we should be able to sail right through." With a quick grin and an impulsive hug, Kara dove toward the weapons bay. Panic surged and held Valen rooted to the spot until she heard Kara’s voice through the comm, "Let me know when we are getting close. Remember, think in three dimensions, only the best Space Fleet captains manage to do it well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Right," Valen thought. "Like I’m going to be able to compete with them."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">All too soon the comm blared, "SLF Alpha3610 drop your drives and prepare to be boarded."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Damn, I should have told you to turn off the auto-ident transponder. Reach over to the left side of the panel and push the button marked galley comm, then blast -45 degrees by -45 degrees at maximum thrust. Then it’s all yours!" Excitement crackled in Kara’s voice and Valen heard a sharp gleeful laugh follow as the weapons switched online. This time she was reaching for the backup power even before Kara yelled for it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">These pilots were better than the ones near Centralys. Banking and weaving for all she was worth wasn’t gaining Ghost Wind anything at all. Just as the leader was about to overtake them Valen tried one more jog. It left them facing back toward Karanal just in time to witness an expanding bubble of something, looking no more solid than a soap bubble, brush past their pursuers. As it touched their ships they went dark. It seemed like slow motion as it swept through them and continued on toward Ghost Wind. It sliced through the view port and rushed through Valen. Red hot lances of fire screamed through her head at every interface point. Her gasp of surprise turned into a shriek of agony that ended abruptly as her cyberware went off-line.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The pain ended as quickly as it began. As it faded away Valen triggered the re-init procedures for her implant, bringing most of it back on-line. Basic coordination came back from hard-coded modules. As systems switched back in she heard Kara shout from the weapons section, "Valen, what’s wrong? What happened? Are you alright? Why is the power offline??"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Didn’t you see it?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"See what??? Damn, everything’s dead up here. Begin restart, we have to get power back!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Everything’s dead here too..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’m on my way to engineering, you stay put till the power’s back."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen heard her moving along the passage then total silence descended. The only sound was her breathing, the only light came from the distant sun, filtered through the main view port. It was as if a giant beast had died. She felt Ghost Wind slowly cooling, the heat of her life ebbing away, her seals beginning to leak precious air. Suddenly there was a streak, then a thump as something plowed into her chest, then the feel of cloth tightening as Mr. Jones pulled himself to a stop on her chest and lap. He was trembling violently as they clung together in the dark.</p>
