<p class="sectioncaption">Things to remember throughout</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Something to remember for the entire Valen saga */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What do they say about damaged people Faith?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Damaged people are dangerous because they know how to survive"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* REMEMBER - Valen is used to power. she assumes she will be listened to and deferred to. She will interact with her environment with that assurance, even when not Premiere. She has a sense of honor and will use that in judging her every action and decision. What she tells Kara is very true - "I won't send anyone into anything I wouldn't do myself" */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Also remember - she has had special forces/infiltration/covert action training. She can think tactically and quickly, even if she is a bit rusty after years as a politician.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* <a href="http://www.tailhook.org/AVSLANG.htm">aviator slang</a> - suck some of this into starship slang */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">keep in mind how the cyberware would affect her - she can't remember if there were memories she lost, although she is suspicious of it. what would it do to be able to modify body chemistry responses at will? what if you could just change the chemical mix at a whim?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">remember - without a medic they are at great risk from serious injury aboard Ghost Wind. Krys will fill the void somewhat with the healing magic, however a good medic would still be a good idea...</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">Things to consider revising</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* move the coup from Valen's assistant to her head of special security - he has the most access and the best chances of gathering what is needed to take her down. he made his move when he realized Valen was about to secure a treaty with the kr'kch - exoskeleton based race - that would have significantly increased her power and prestige. */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">consider: Kyira dieing - perhaps the damage is too great for her to survive after leaving Marwatt's - she could either die as a heroine somewhere during the adventures or die from inability to continue with the internal damage she has taken - she might be the one to make the psych type comments</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* for riplev use someone looking like maggie walsh */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* need Ghost Wind design */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* need the event that changed Valen into wanting to do something as Premiere - idea 1 - the woman, child, and grass fence */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">first shift is to ‘earth’ when Krys is rescued, second shift is to z when they become involved in Eltaryn’s plan. Their arrival is a crash landing in the mountains near the gigabolt peaks, the crash results from getting swiped by a tapping pulse</p>
<p class="regtxt5">they need to climb down from the mountain and find a road to one of the nearer cities. Should be something Krys is at least a bit familiar with.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">First shift is just before they hire Lynn. Kara knows Lynn from the upgrades to her ship and trusts her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They pick up Krys during the first shift. Lynn helps the most once they get back in bringing Krys to a comfort level with her new surroundings. As does Will once he is brought in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After the crash Krys helps Lyn the most - being she has the best survival skills for the area they find themselves in.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">ship mostly survives but ends up almost entirely buried in a snow field from the residual heat of its hull, the smuggled robot fighting units remain in the hold, at least until found by scavengers - may delete the fighting druids. Best place for crash would be near Gigabolts, although the monastery and Valley of Experiment are also good - Krys would be good enough to manage survival in either place.
</p>
<p class="regtxt5">add descriptions of Ghost Wind, inside and outside - especially indicate strength of weaponry and power systems.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They manage to patch things together and return to empirial space. A couple of years pass before they are transported to zeltrop. Landing is a successful crash - they managed to walk/stagger away, but the ship is in bad shape. Approach through gigabolt region and get hit by a tapping pulse, causing the crash.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Eventually they get hooked into Eltaryn’s scheme. For a time they are involved with the River Wind and it’s trade in the Valley of Experiment - a relatively cult free zone where the Arcanes are a bit better accepted.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">maybe scene of Lyn and Krys working on hyperdrive systems - Krys holding and acting as gopher for Lyn as she pulls things apart to fix them</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In another conversation - again shortly after leaving Karanal but before they formally decide to throw in together - "I envy you. You have this place, this ship that you own. In it you can go anywhere you wish. If some place gets too strange or difficult, you just move on"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I don’t know why I wanted power as much as I did - I got it, I squashed many people to get it, both good and bad. I made a few changes, some even positive, but the inertia overcame my efforts. At the last I had less control over things than most private citizens, who can mostly ignore the evils of their government, as long as they aren’t directly in their faces.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on the hut */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the hut - how to make use of it - it seems we could do the best by using it to influence from the background, to provide information to those seeking it, to provide answers to difficult problems, to function something like an oracle - I agree with the others, I don’t think we should directly launch ourselves into the fray at this time. Maybe there will come a time when something so horrible, so dangerous and powerful appears when we will need to take a stand, until that time I would be content to travel, learn and aid quietly from the background. If there is one thing I learned as premier, it is the far reaching effects of actions that seem insignificant at the time of their doing.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">to dispose of the stuff from Karanal they are going to have to find a fence. Kara knows of one  - Will - on Temmis 8. Will was removed from SpaceFleet during one of Valen’s purges. They need to get to Temmis and then persuade will to help. First they need to get some type of id for Valen. This will require her to hack something and create an alternate id. Her ability to hack systems will be needed again. Still need to explain where she got that and her ability to marginally handle a starship.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">They will go to Marwatt’s Reach figuring it will be a nice out of the way place to create an id for Valen. It’s a company planet and OutSystems is noted for being rather lax with it’s personnel records. While they are there they get involved with Kyira, Ayesha, and Shandi and their attempts to get information off planet about the crimes OutSystems is perpetrating against the indigenous races.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">in taverns and such, balads of older times as spacers and haulers, asteroid miner, explorations, and the like - want the feel from some of the stan rogers kinds of things about the changes occuring from changes in technology, economics, government and the like - there will be a lot of pockets that will be outside the Razak attack pattern during the first phases.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ayesha was adept at security but was in a hurry and left more traces than she should have, the traces she left were noticed before Valen cracked in, then Valen went and erased the traces, when the security person and the sys admin tried to show the traces to the security chief they were gone, this prompted a secondary search, it was this intensified search that caught Ayesha.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Ayesha makes contact with Kara while Valen is scoping out the company hq, she makes plans to be on Ghost Wind before they leave - her time table is close to what Valen and Kara have decided on - it allows for resupply of Ghost Wind and enough time to check for additional cargo. Kara and Valen preped Ghost Wind to need resupply while they were on the way in. Kara will tell the port authorities that she came here because she knew she would get better supplies from an OutSystems outpost than from DevelStar.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Later - on a fringe world in a dive bar - maybe coyote style bar where they meet Lynn - Valen shifts to her hard, no nonsense mode as she enters, startling Kara with it. They move to a table near the back wall where a lone man was sitting, as they approached he got up and moved. Valen remains there, hidden partly in the shadows while Kara goes and talks with Will. Kara introduces Valen as her cousin and tells Will she needs to unload some cargo. She doesn’t have all the correct documents to move it through regular channels, plus she really doesn’t want to sell it to the people who might normally buy it. A lot of it is military type hardware that would normally go to regional governors and police forces. Valen is more adamant about it than Kara. Will promises to do what he can if Kara will run a cargo to Marwatt's and pick up two people there. The people are to be delivered to a DevelStar</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Krys, Valen, and Kara - this could be part of the previous section - when they are meeting up with Lynn - walking the corridors near the docks when a throbbing pulse drew Krys’s attention. Show follows it to its source - some type of heavy beat music coming from a tech/punk hangout - Lynn smiles behind her in secret amusement as Krys is drawn in. Krys finds she likes the hard, heavy metal and driven beat of it and becomes another victim of tech metal.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Later she will accuse Valen of forgetting how to dance when she notices her being tight and twitchy. Something about the way Valen moves lets her think it would be an appropriate comment...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Hassles for the Ghost Wind are less than for boarding commercial liners. Although if berth modules are used they are often boarded through passenger loading facilities and the passengers are subject to whatever level of security Kara wishes employed, as long as it meets local minimums.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on religious convictions */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara - Do you believe in anything outside yourself then?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - Not in the way you mean. She gestured to the plants around them - there is the true mystery of the universe, right there - life...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - The rest is each race trying to create something bigger than themselves, but still like them - I don’t think the ‘deity’ of the universe is anything like that - it is life itself, trying to find an understanding of itself, trying to keep itself going...the rest is our vanities asserting themselves. Who am I to claim I speak for ‘the universe’ that my words are the ‘truth’ of everything? What arrogance, what self deception.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - We get hooked into needing to accomplish things. I wanted to form the Alliance into something better than before. I wanted to make it stable and kind and all sorts of things yet everything I tried was opposed at every step. On one hand we seek excitement and experience, yet we deeply resist change. Yet our very existence is constant change - we are born, we grow, we age... what if the importance isn’t our accomplishments but the changes we go through themselves? What if our resistance to change is what allows us to perceive it? What if we are an attempt by the universe itself to experience itself? Maybe all those sermons on bettering ourselves and being productive are all a smoke screen over the truth - a truth that is far more indifferent than we want it to be.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara - Are you sure you weren’t raised Eritsani? Those are very Eritsani concepts. We are, the universe is. Our purpose is to experience the universe. We have ethics we should follow, ethics essential to the survival of a group of individuals, but many of the "truths" of the Grounders are not valid for us. These are the truths of the Eritsani. Some of us worship the <a href="../../gm_resources/gods/goddess_changes.htm">Goddess of Changes</a>, but she is more a focusing of this concept rather than a set apart diety.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara maintains a shrine in her cabin to the Goddess - she rather likes the raging natural force aspect of her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Individuals can make a difference - an assassin at the right place, a passer-by when there is trouble...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was in the right place to move into being Premiere. When the economy did the slow crash after the cyber wars it caused a really large shake-up that took years to occur. By that time I was one of the representatives from Icicle and was able to make better use of that event than any possible scheme I could have tried. The trick is to remember that it is very hard to create and guide a situation to a result you desire. Every being will surprise you. Say you’ve watched your target for weeks and every morning she goes to this particular café at the same time. On the day you decide to make your move she will over-sleep, or be sick, or be entertaining someone. Something will be different and the plan will have to change.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I don't trust authority, it never has my best interests at heart, so I climbed up the chain. At every level I hoped to break through the layers of bureaucracy and special interests to where I could have an effect. I never did. Instead I found at each level there were more and more layers of bureaucracy filtering my efforts. Once I became premiere there was little I could do without relying on those under me to execute the instructions. I couldn't easily remove the offending bureaucrats, more would rise to fill the void, each with their own special agendas. It came down to forming my own special projects group, but even that had its own interests at heart. It got to the point where my day started with scanning as many different sources of news as possible, inside and outside the Imperium, to try and keep up with what was really happening, instead of the doctored info my "intelligence" groups were giving me.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">in this case they both have walls, just in different ways - Valen’s have to do with trust, Kara’s with loss of freedom. Need to develop their affair as a constant straining against these boundary issues - there will be advances and retreats in their levels of coping, and the stresses on them that will result..</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* As premiere - killed those preaching separatism from the empire or any type of intolerance of others in empire. Could work this into the Butcher reputation - orders those responsible for oppressive teaching or propaganda to be killed. */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Look at imperial time-line - will Valen remain single/aloof for the duration? Did she have anything prior to ascension to premiere? */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Valen and the hyperdrive */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">During the trip to earth the nav comp is damaged, so until they get to Lynn Valen needs to link in and function as the nav computer interface to the hyperdrive.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* bar */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">shan might be crazy enough to strut her stuff on the bar, valen would for a lark if it crossed hermind. she would certainly use it if she needed a diversion. lynn likes the place cause it's noisy, crowded, and makes it hard to over-hear any conversations. also the crowd makes it really hard to follow someone. her old partner was also partnered with Lise as co-owner. he used it for the same kinds of meetings.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Krys returning to the Lotus Empire */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Think about the reactions I had envisioned for the AoC Stygian characters on their return to Stygia after being in the Barachain Islands - the relief to be back in a climate that was comfortable and made sense, the scent of the dry desert air with the hints of flowers in the city, the incense from the temples, the noises of the caravans, the look and feel of the souk...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on climb to power */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">i don't trust authority, it never has my best interests at heart, so i climbed up the chain. at evrey level i hoped to break through the layers of bureaucracy and special interests to where i could have an effect. i never did. instead i found at each level there were more and more layers of bureaucracy filtering my efforts. once i became premiere there was little i could do without relying on those under me to execute the instructions. i couldn't easily remove the offending bureaucrats, more would rise to fill the void, each with their own special agendas. it came down to forming my own special projects group, but even that had its own interests at heart. it got to the point where my day started with scanning as many different sources of news as possible, inside and outside the Imperium, to try and keep up with what was really ahppening, instead of the doctored info my "intelligence" groups were giving me</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Icicle reprise */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen will return to Icicle with the Hut to recover the evidence of the <a href="../../gm_resources/info/creationteam.htm">Creation Team</a> that Valeria had found. She will be lost in memories from the time she opens their old home until Kara helps her leave. This is the time when she creates the cemetary/shrine in the Hut.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* story - descent */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">remember - must be survivable - but really close to not...:)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">have tapping pulse clip engineering - valen will silently scream as the pulse fires.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">she revives the others and ends up being rather drained from the healing required</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* misc story notes */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">krys will wake up at the end of the fire fight since she has auto-running healing - she should be getting up when Kara arrives to rescue her</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Shandi could really groove on raves and the like - the energy might keep her awake?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">look at security cracking in valen000 and remember the best hacks start with people/environment investigation</p>

<p class="regtxt5">remember - something to comment on the plants as scrubbers in Ghost Wind - in low tech space air quality is a serious issue</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Peter Carl Faberge 1846-1920 - could use for something if desired</p>

<p class="regtxt5">for Valen's hut book add more from Kaltereth and make her more of an acquaintance of Margla's, maybe from her days at Skelos</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* i was designed as an infiltrator - cracking-ware, detection-ware, human appearance, enhanced hearing and vision, stuff like that. i'm not a combat unit. although i got lucky and the cyberware turned on some stuff in my brain that makes me even more effective. the ability to see and control electro-magnetic spectra. it's how i fool sensors and detectors. it's hard work though and i can't do it without knowing something about what i'm fooling. need to know what to tell it and all. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* for Valen stuff - she could flash back to the labs - when they first turned her on and she tuned the interface by mental energy. first pain, then localize - find the center of it and concentrate on reducing it, find the next - do a third and black out from effort. techs come in notice changes in devices and run diags, these wake her up and show her quick way to find other nodes. through trial/error she figures out how to re-run diags, techs notice - then one notices she is awake, is going to give her more drugs until she stops them, "No, hurts." then they notice she is actually tuning the connections, reducing power use by about half, go get her 'father'</p>

<p class="regtxt5">it doesn't take her long to figure out how to move past the nueron/electrical interface and into the wires as a chain of low level 'noise'. studying when alone she learns how to collect and map the data before they begin teaching her the interfaces. after the interfaces she has two ways of data interpretation. their way and her way. her way they can't block with anti-virals or other techniques. the closest to blocking there is would be power conditioning and filtering, removing her probes along with the other analog 'noise'.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">once she can begin downloading interpreters, debuggers, and processor command structs she rapidly creates methods of interpretting the data she 'tastes' over the wires.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">this should be once they are back at PsyberDyne */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* at hospital at university - valen wakes disoriented, when mom asks, "Sarah..." - she responds with "Dead."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">could elaborate - mom knows its not Sarah, tells her not to say anything to dad. dad knows and says don't say anything to mom. valen left in the middle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">mom wants to know what happened. dad does as well but is busy at first getting her safely transported. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* would there have been any sort of disaster recovery procedure implemented for PsyberDyne? this could have given Valen a place to get data on herself even after the destruction of the cyber-wars. */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* jack in/jack out for Valen will have shifts in perspective. if it is abrupt there will be recalibration times as she shifts awareness */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* Valen - on existance - this is one of the prices for her survival - sometimes it bothers her, other times it doesn't... */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">What am i? sometimes that is a big one. cyberware eyes, part of my brain and exotic enhancements throughout my body. am i still really human? i can't have children, not that i wanted them. nanites keep me healthy, alternate data storage and fuel cells share space with intestines and other things.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In another conversation - again shortly after leaving Karanal but before they formally decide to throw in together - I envy you. You have this place, this ship that you own. In it you can go anywhere you wish. If some place gets too strange or difficult, you just move on...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I don’t know why I wanted power as much as I did - I got it, I squashed many people to get it, both good and bad. I made a few changes, some even positive, but the inertia overcame my efforts. At the last I had less control over things than most private citizens, who can mostly ignore the evils of their government, as long as they aren’t directly in their faces.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Valen Hut - chronicles - consider trying to get a Black Company kind of feel? */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I guess I’m the unofficial chronicler for this merry band. Shandi has that diary thing she’s compelled to keep, but it is only marginally less sterile than the logbook her father kept. Plus she won’t really write about herself - like the time she and Tyana got into the discussion of cybernetics.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tyana started life as an intelligence that became aware in a supercomputer system and spent the next several thousand years looking for a way to get a body. Her perspectives on things are very different from the rest of us, yet Shandi only mentions the creation of a body for her and the strange compromise we finally ended up performing to make it all work.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">And Shandi, now there’s another bit of work. Someone or something has torn big holes in her head.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I finally pieced it all together, at least most of it. Shandi always refers to things as pre Aztol and post Aztol. She really means before and after all the mind things that have been done to her. The beginning happened when Aztol decided to take revenge on Eltaryn and abducted her. That wasn’t enough for him, so he implanted something in her head, then altered her memories and basic personality, using some type of device that allowed working on minds the way programmers work on computers.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She was rescued by an adventuring group that her father had assembled and returned to him. Sharyl, Kayara, and he then had to remove the demon or device Aztol had implanted and then try and return her to normal. Their magic machine was pitted against Aztol’s machine and their skills against his. There was more though - the removal of the ‘demon’ was only possible if she was artificially kept alive as its removal was supposed to trigger shutdown of her body.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After surviving all that, then they tried to load Sharyl’s memories directly into her head. For some reason the information didn’t take. Listening to her, it was like the basic ways of seeing and thinking about things were so radically different that there was no way she could integrate the new stuff with the old.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Marwatt's and identity */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Before we can do much more, I’m going to need an identity. There’s only so long I can hide on Ghost Wind while we’re in port before someone starts to become suspicious, besides, I’ll start to go crazy...what we need to find is a colony world or one of the company worlds. It wouldn’t be hard to create a new ID in their system and then propagate it back into Imperial Records. I should be able to do it from here. As long as no one does a retinal scan or a level 6 fingerprint scan it’ll hold up." My fingers started to dance over the codes to begin creating a personnel record, then I stopped. "Actually we should be somewhere else when I do this. This place is quarantined, I bet every transmission and every bit of data is being closely monitored. Probably the best place would be a world belonging to one of the resource development companies. Their systems are considered secure enough that records transferred from them would not normally be questioned. Either OutSystems or DevelStar would be the best."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"If the security is that good how are going to get in?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That won’t be a problem..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">on the way to Marwatt’s Reach have Valen studying and playing with Kara’s system on ghost wind familiarizing herself once again with security programs and systems. On Marwatt’s she takes longer but uses no cracking utilities</p>
<p class="regtxt5">she was watching me carve through the Ghost Wind’s security programs like a knife through butter. Finally she blurted out, "What are you? Where did you learn to handle a ship, and where did you learn to crack security like that?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I wasn’t always premier. How do you think I managed to work my way up the chain so quickly? When you know what your opponents have really been doing, it’s amazing how cooperative they really can be..." she was quiet a few moments then asked again. "I attended university, but it was the SpaceFleet training center for intelligence, not Aristaleez Polytechnic. They are both on Aristaleez Prime, one is the public campus, the other is in the shadows. I was a field operative for five years after school. They had groomed me for the post on Zennis and to infiltrate the rebels there. My cover was assistant to the ambassador. The other part of my cover revolved around Amanda. She was also trained as an agent, although her task was data analysis. She wasn’t even supposed to be involved in actual field work, but she was sent along to Zennis so we would appear to be what we claimed, bored minor functionaries in the great bureaucracy that was the Alliance. Unfortunately she was also idealistic enough to get sucked in by the rebels and started to believe in their cause. Actually, we both were, except I managed to see more of their actual plans than Amanda did. Until then we were trying to figure out how to feed enough faked data back to our supervisors and then join with the rebels when they struck. Their actual attack plans called for the destruction of the communications, power and water systems for the main colonies. There were no backups, nor were there any plans for getting aid to the non-military survivors. If they had gone ahead with the plans, hundreds of thousands would have died. So I turned them in. Then got to watch as the people I knew were slaughtered. Amanda disappeared in the fighting. I’m glad she escaped! I decided I would become powerful enough to prevent similar things in the future. My skills were honed as I clawed my way up the governmental food chain and then into the power blocks of the Alliance, finally ending with becoming premier.”</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As my fingers danced over the keyboard, rapidly entering security cracking commands and codes I wasn’t noticing the intricacies I would have expected. The final two levels to reach birth and personnel records were ridiculously easy. The changes were easy to insert and soon the system was creating an identi-card and record updates for Irina Katarya. Setting up the routine to update the records at Imperial Registry was a little more challenging since it had to add the records, back date them to the right time frame, then erase itself from transmission and monitoring logs. As I backed out of the system I invoked part of the security check system and scanned for enabled security mechanisms. About half of the standard routines had been shut off. Whoever had been in here was adept, but very careless about removing tracks. Playing a guess I diverted and ran one of the basic system utilities to check recently deleted files and virtual memory use. Then a quick call to a binary code editor revealed what I had guessed. Fragments of a distinctive security cracking utility remained in several locations. It was an old one I hadn’t seen since leaving the intelligence group, effective, but common and dated.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara watched fascinated as screen after screen of odd symbols flashed across the screen as I barely even seemed to glance at them. She started to ask a question or two until I barely shook my head and wandered my eyes around the small area. Catching on almost immediately she launched into questions about the ‘problem’ we were supposed to be fixing and how much longer it was going to take.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There’s one more thing I need to check here - some of the secondary lines seem to be damaged also. Probably another half hour." Quickly scanning the file fragments remaining revealed extensive copying from files dealing with resource location and mapping files. There were several from the director’s personal account and a couple from management communications files. Five more minutes gave me the time to quickly look at the smaller files and showed only files dealing with setbacks in accessing some of the more remote resource pockets. The references were loaded with innuendoes and euphemisms about something, but there wasn’t enough to figure out what it was.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It took an additional twenty minutes to back out while enabling the standard setup on the way. There were probably enough clues for a good security analyst to realize the system had been compromised, but it would be unlikely that the company people here would manage to find anything. It was a quick crawl back to Kara and then a short walk back to the security station. "There you go. Everything should be back to normal now. You might want to check it before we go..." for a moment it looked like he might actually do so, then he just shrugged and waved us out.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Once we were clear of the administration complex and walking down a relatively empty street I turned to answer her unspoken question, "Someone was into the system ahead of us. They used an old, commercially available cracking system and forgot to turn on half the security procedures when they exited. If I’d left it that way someone would have noticed it for sure.

<p class="regtxt5">Kara threaded her way through the press of people and equipment of the docks, working her way deeper into the maze of corridors stretching into the station. At last she turned to a non-descript door with block letters spelling out "Martinez Ship Services". She pushed it open and walked into the dirty, cramped outer office. Somewhere in the depths of the rooms a buzzer sounded. After several minutes a short oriental woman slipped in from the inner office.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took only a few moments to remove the cover plates and attach the interceptor into the main data lines. Once the data link was connected the ghost world of the datanet blossomed in her awareness. A few simple sweeps brought her to the first wall. It was short work to slip her way through with the access codes and tools from Karanal. The final two levels to reach birth and personnel records were ridiculously easy. She inserted an updated record for Irina Katarya and then flagged it for immediate replication and updating. Setting the Imperial Registry update routine was a bit more challenging since it had to add the records, back date them to the right time frame, then erase itself from transmission and monitoring logs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Kara watched nervously as Valen sat silent and still against the tunnel wall. Every once in a while her hand would twitch this way or that way. After many minutes she smiled slightly and then frowned. Just as Kara was about to shake her awake her eyes popped open. "Done. There’s one more thing I need to check here - some of the secondary lines seem to be damaged also. Probably another half hour." Valen’s eyes closed again as she scanned the file fragments. What remained were pieces of extensive copying from files dealing with resource location and mapping. There were several from the director’s personal account and a couple from management communications files. Five more minutes gave her the time to quickly look at the smaller files. They detailed setbacks in accessing some of the more remote resource pockets. The references were loaded with innuendoes and euphemisms about something, but there wasn’t enough to figure out what it was.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"> It took her an additional ten minutes to back out while enabling the standard security setup on the way. There were probably enough clues for a good security analyst to realize the system had been compromised, but it would be unlikely that the company people here would manage to find anything. It was a quick crawl back to access portal and then a short walk back to the security station. "There you go. Everything should be back to normal now.

<p class="regtxt5">Once they were clear of the administration complex and walking down a relatively empty street Valen turned to answer Kara’s unspoken question, "Someone was into the system ahead of us. They used an old, commercially available cracking system and forgot to turn on half the security procedures when they exited. If I’d left it that way someone would have noticed it for sure. What I couldn’t figure out was what they got. They weren’t in the financial sections and they weren’t in the restricted development and resource locating databases. They were scanning memos and general letters. It was strange, but I’m sure I recognized their style." Valen paused, thoughtfully for long moments as they moved back toward the star port. As they reached Ghost Wind she smacked her head and exclaimed, "Shit, I do know who it was-damn, I’d have thought she’d have given it up by now." She ran the rest of the way to the ship. Kara arrived a slightly behind her to find her at one of the terminals querying one of the local directories. "Senjin, Senjin...there, Ayesha Senjin."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What, who...?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Eight years ago a ghost from my past walked back into my awareness. We had gone through the Alliance Security Administration Academy together. I don’t think she recognized me, but I remembered her. During her work at the Ministry of Development, in the division handling exploration and exploitation of new worlds, she had come across some odd pieces of information. They were enough to convince her OutSystems Resource Development Corporation was destroying indigent populations then registering the worlds as empty. Once a planet was declared empty they could develop it. Populated worlds require a much more stringent development plan than empty ones. OutSystems kept no records of what they did. The information she had really didn’t prove anything, but it sure looked suspicious. My staff told her we needed more, I told her the same thing when she petitioned her case up the chain of command. Last I had heard she had left the Ministry. I hadn’t realized she’d actually gone hunting." Valen paused long enough to scan the data fragments once more. "There wasn’t much left of what she downloaded, but she might actually have found something."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* a negotiation */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She looked back at him and said conversationally, "You know, the easiest way to stop this war is to kill you. You do realize that, I’m sure. Seems to me your following this plan is a much better alternative, don’t you think?" she paused a moment, then smiled and continued, "Of course I could be wrong... be sure and let me know if I am." She watched him struggle with it for a while then motioned him out. As he turned toward the door she added in an ice-cold voice, "If you screw with me I’ll find you."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And what, kill me?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh no. You won’t die; no matter how hard you beg..." she purred back at him.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* after Marwatt's rescue - Shandi will stay close to Kyira - Kyira she knows, the others she doesn't. The ship will fascinate her - it is concentrated tech. */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Kyira - right after lift-off from Marwatt's */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">As the ship lifted Valen glanced at Kyira. The worry and animation was draining from her eyes, replaced by emptiness deeper than she ever seen before. In a tired voice Kyira excused herself and slowly shuffled off toward the room they had assigned her. Quietly she was mumbling, "I can’t do it any more, I just can’t. I’m just too tired."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara - Do you think she'll make it?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - I don't know. I saw that look in my sister's eyes shortly before she died. I think it's why she died. The psych types are wrong. There are people damaged to the point where they can’t be healed, especially by 'working through' it. Sometimes drugs can make them comfortable. Kyira might be one of them. Sometimes the ending of the pain is really the only acceptable option. Those who survive them need to deal with the loss, but for the victim I think it is better.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara - I thought your sister died in an accident.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - reacting -  She did, but I really think it was because she didn't care any more.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* next section needs to blend with the above */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I wonder what is going through her mind right now?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"And I wonder what is going through yours, oh ‘imperious fugitive’. What are going to do now?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh ‘courageous captain’, I was thinking about starting a single woman battle against the galaxy to reclaim my rightful power, but first I need you to surrender your ship to me...Well, what are you waiting for?" she paused for a moment before continuing, "Actually, I’m still thinking about it. At first I wanted to get back into power as soon as I could. Then I started noticing how truly free you are here in your ship. As long as there is enough to cover expenses you go where you will, when you will. Seems like more freedom than I ever had even as Premier. Now I’m not so sure. How about you? Shipping will be even more critical as things start to change, but it will be a lot more dangerous now."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’ll probably continue - if the risks are higher, I can ask for higher compensations."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* conversation adds */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You know, it's ironic. After the Jaranthus failures everyone though cyberware was so dangerous and it was banned. If something went wrong with the stuff in my head it'd kill me and maybe a few hundred other people at worst. What did they replace cyber research with? Genetic engineering. If something goes wrong with that millions could die.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Let me tell you something about power. It is an illusion. In it's purest form it comes from trust. I trust your decisions to benefit me and I defer to your abilities. But if I suddenly decide you aren't to be trusted, if I walk away so does your power. You can maintain power by fear, but that is even more tenuous, you have to keep the fear alive through demonstrations of terror. The biggest aid to maintaining power are the sycophants that always need to latch onto someone "more powerful" than themselves, never realizing they don't have to have someone in power over them.
The truth is you have more power here than I ever had as premier. You decide whom you trade with, where you go, and how you do it. I can impose outside power over you only as long as you work inside the areas I have control over. You can always move on. As premier I am stuck where I am. As we have already established my power only works as long as my directives are followed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* maybe situation where Valen quarantines a planet for social structures too repressive for the Empire. */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You’re policies are unacceptable. Until you reform your social structure you do not belong in the Empire."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"What you going to do about it? The Alliance didn’t like it either, yet they left us to our own culture."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"There are a couple of things. My first thought would be to kill your leaders and see what happened next. Then keep killing the new leaders until the repressive ideas are gone. However the risk is I might create a martyr or two, so instead I will quarantine you. Nothing will be allowed to enter or leave this world."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Many will starve and it will be your fault."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Many will starve, but it won’t be my fault. All you need to do is modify your social structure until all your people have equal opportunities and rights. Then the quarantine will be lifted and you will be fine. It is your choice, not mine."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"But you can’t just come in here, judge us, and force us to change. You have no moral right."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen smiled. "How naive. I have any right I choose to take in this matter. You trade with my empire. To do so you must either belong to it or have trade agreements with it. Until this situation changes you will have neither." Her smile deepened, "Don’t think of trying to get a ship or communication off-world. The quarantine drones will destroy any ship and the blockers will jam your signals. Have a good life and call me when you are ready to negotiate."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* PsyberDyne - on her implant and implants in general */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I’m one of the ones where it worked. Maybe it was because they had to do this to save my life. The others were volunteers, in good condition beforehand. Even with the model I have there were tissue rejections and madness issues in some of the tests. Maybe it was a good idea this was all stopped. I wouldn't trade it - to do so would mean my death, but even so, it could be for the best.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* at a starport or somewhere - shortly after picking up Shandi */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen in conversation with Kara, or maybe an incident that occurs after they have the hut - near a starport somewhere  -  she and Valen were walking past a snack shop or something  - some punk kid made a comment about ‘you dropped your wallet’ in her direction  - next thing I knew she was over the railing and in their face. I didn’t even see her move. as I came up near her I heard her saying, "Excuse me, you seem to have dropped your drink," as she tipped it onto the person. Then in that deadly silken tone of hers she asked, "Now wasn’t that funny? About as funny as harassing strangers, yes? Shall we have some more fun then?" then she flipped back over the railing to land near me. I remember when Kayara was describing the weird stuff done to her reflexes and muscle system. I didn’t believe what it meant until then.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">One of them pulled a knife on her then, "Look spacey, just hand over what you’re carrying and we won’t hurt any of you much." Shandi just stood there with her usual dazed, dopey expression and didn’t move at all. The tough flicked his knife toward her arm. His swing missed her arms by 6 inches as she twisted out of the way, so quickly he couldn’t even begin to correct for her movement.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She looked back at him with a confused, childlike look and said, "You tried to hurt me, I can’t believe you tried to hurt me," in a quiet little girl voice. Her face and voice didn’t change as she continued, "Why did you try and hurt me?" Midway through this sentence her foot shot out and snapped into his crotch. He doubled up while her hands flashed out, grabbed his hair and twisted him to her. He started to move the knife into her side when her left hand jerked downward and crunched over his wrist. His scream of pain was cut short as she hauled him to the left with his pinioned wrist while twisting his head to the right. As the lifeless body dropped to the floor she grinned at the rest of the bullies, amusement and madness flashing in her eyes. "Anyone else want to play?" She asked in her crazy voice.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The entire group fell over itself trying to back away from her. Her voice followed them down the corridor, "Are you sure you don’t want to play?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* piloting */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">she was perfectly wired in, her hands twitching and shifting as she dialed in the shifts and jogs. behind her, the razak patrol wove and bobbed, trying to line up a clean shot. she gave a death-grin to Kara, then eased off the speed slightly, drawing the patrol in closer. "hang on," she whispered, slamming the attitude jets fullon, flipping ghost wind end for end and slamming full power to the mains. in an instant she was behind the patrol and flicking the attitude controls again. "Got it!" Kara howled from weapons control as the patrol ship erupted in a gout of flame.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* covert ops missions */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">the last one before Icicle, where she lost her girlfriend, was the final straw. it was an impossible mission, no way to preserve the status quo and get the "terrorist" leaders captured and extracted. of the five infiltrators, she was the only one back. of the 40 special ops support team, only five made it back and the situation ended with the death of 4 thousand locals through actual combat and damage to critical infrastructure - she will eventually tell it to Kara</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* still need to figure out the situation that earns her the label "Butcher" */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">needs to be a lose-lose situation, with no way of a good outcome. if history were to look back at it, assuming enough survived the Razaks, she would be vindicated for her choices. in fact, some vindication was filtering into the public awareness close to the end of her reign.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* on comapnion rings */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He stood in front of me, the dagger plunged deep into my entrails. Pain was a fire-brand throughout, but the battle reflexes kept it manageable. "Did you think you could kill me that easily? You have travelled with me and should know better."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Lying bitch, I got through your defences and now you will die."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That ring you still wear? The one that kept you alive through so much? I didn't tell you everything about it. That cold, empty feeling radiating up your arm is your life energy and soul being dissipated into the multi-verse. When it is finished, there will be nothing left of you to come back." Irena watched as he slowly shrank and shrivelled from view, screaming until he had too little left to continue. She watched with a cold smile, never taking the dagger from herself until there was nothing left. She dropped it on top of the blackened twisted metal bit that had been a companion ring.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Valen - Killing a human changes you. That much is true. It depends though on who you were before. Some find it exhilarating and grow to love the rush. Some shatter and are never the same again. For me it made me realize just how fragile it all is. How quickly it can end. I don't like killing, but it isn't the worst thing you can do to a person. What’s worse is breaking them down, destroying their self, and leaving them alive but unable to ever be what they could have been. Personally I would prefer to die quickly rather than have that happen.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara - The biggest difficulty is trust. If I know someone's killed how can I trust that they won't kill me?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - That’s the biggest issue of all and it really depends on the reasons a person kills in the first place. I’m more like a military person, I kill when I have to and I don't like it. You are safe with me.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on premiere - when they are infiltrating somewhere */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - it’s mostly about the attitude. Sure I had the title premiere, but if I didn't radiate the power when I walked into a situation it just didn't work. You’ve seen how it works. You didn't shoot me on your flight deck.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Kara - You were so confident, even with a blaster in your face.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Valen - That's how it works. It doesn’t matter how terrified you are if you can look calm and confident then it's working. Trust me, I was terrified, just figured you might not shoot me if I could intrigue you instead.</p>

She wouldn't need to fix the Hut after becoming the Keeper. It would be an easy thing with those powers.

<p class="regtxt5">‘She was trying to tap into her system back on Centralys, then she cut the connection. She started to say something, then shrieked and ripped the comm set from her head. I don’t know exactly how to describe what happened after that. She threw herself backward out of the chair, more scrambling and throwing herself over it than getting out of it. As she was moving she was screaming, the only words we could make out were ,’Get OUT OF MY HEAD!!!’, over and over again as she scrambled backward from the console. When she hit the wall she slid down into a crouch. As she crouched there her hands pulled back and twisted into claws. If anyone got close she snarled and raised them, more like a cornered cat than a woman. Several of the others moved in toward her at once, even as I was trying to say not to. As they closed her eyes grew even more frightened and her hands wove in complex clawing motions. Once they were within touching distance of her she slumped forward into a fetal position and didn’t seem to notice much after that. There was a lot of discussion on what could be done for her. Normally they would send her to their psych unit and let them work on her. With the evacuation and other dangers they weren’t sure that would be such a good idea. The common fear was what if they got into some of the problems, then couldn’t help her before having to move her. In the end we decided I would take her to a safe place and begin her treatment there. The only place I could think of was here, you’ve known her, and I think she still trusts you, at least as much as she trusts anyone...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">‘why, Kara, why did you get involved with her?’</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I told her what had happened finishing with, "I saw that spark you’d mentioned, just once, but I did see it. She begged me to take her to Karanal, not for her, but to warn them..."</p>
