<p class="pagecaption">Valen - Pre-History</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She was tired of practicing security hacking and slipped out for a walk. Normally her father would have been watching her every move, but today he and her brother Andras were casing another job. They were going to use her to crack the building security, then slip in and replace corporate finance records and  backups with altered ones. It was the latest in her father’s long list of schemes to become invaluable to the Chernikov clan. She felt she had her part down perfectly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Quickly she strode along the streets until she came to her favorite place, the river. She followed the bank toward the edge of town until she found the fence around the private school, and the cut she had carefully made in it. It was another five minutes until she approached her favorite clearing, just back from a wide bend in the river. She smiled in anticipation of lounging in the thick grass for the next few hours. She could time her return by the sounds of the River Rat gambling tour that always pulled into dock at 1500 hours.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her peaceful reverie was cut short as she rounded the rock point and saw a girl sprawled in the middle of her grass. The girl hadn’t seen her yet. She could turn and make her way back before anyone knew that a local had invaded the privacy of school land or she could try and bluff it off. Just as she started to turn to leave the girl looked up. Kat stopped and stared at the face in front of her. Except for the cut short and styled hair the face looking back at her was almost exactly her own. The girl’s nose was slightly smaller and her face was a bit rounder and softer. Fear flashed across the girl’s face until she also saw the resemblance. Curiosity replaced the fear and uncertainty as she said, "Hi! Beautiful day for sitting by the river isn’t it." Her accent immediately identified her as an off-worlder, as did her friendly openness, but her warmth was appealing. "My name is Sara, you can join me if you’d like..." still she hesitated, knowing the trouble that always occurred when a local was caught on the school lands. "I won’t tell anyone you were here..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Finally she smiled and moved to sit next to Sara on the grass. "Kat, I’m called Kat. It’s good to meet you Sara!" they spent the next hours idly talking and enjoying the warmth of the sun. All too soon the River Rat’s whistle sounded, prompting Kat to rise. "I’m afraid I’ve got to go, I’ll be expected at home really soon now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you come here often? Now that it’s summer session things are really boring around here. I’d have gone home but my parents refuse to pay for it until my grades are better. Will you come by again? Please?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, I guess I could...it probably won’t be until the end of the week though. It’s hard sometimes to get time to myself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It’s ok, I imagine coming into this place wouldn’t be something you’d want to do. It’s just so boring in here..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, really, I WILL come back again. I just have to work with my father several days each week to help keep the family going. I’ll slip away again when I have a chance." Thoughts of Sara and the school occupied her as she made her way back to the small house she shared with the rest of her family. There were several generations crammed in under the same roof. At one time there had been talk about buying a small family enclave in the cheaper suburb sections until her father had almost gotten caught during his last scheme. It had been close. He’d managed to dump the incriminating stuff before he was detained, but there had been fines for curfew violation and travel in restricted sections that had to be paid. It had swallowed most of their nest egg. Now he was hoping to make it back working jobs for Endrik Chernikov.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Chernikov had approached him earlier in the week with this current job and the promise he would pay current rate plus a small bonus.  Kat’s father had jumped at the chance. It was another way to ingratiate himself with them. She arrived just in time to be back at her terminal when he walked in. "We’ve decided to go tonight instead of tomorrow. The opportunity should be better tonight. Tomorrow they will be changing security protocols for some new director coming in. You’d better have your part down, I don’t want any screw ups tonight. I’ve trained you as well as I can, if your sister hadn’t screwed up and gotten herself offed, I wouldn’t even waste my time on you, but since she did..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Night found them slipping through the back streets of the city, moving from the slum quarter into the edge of the business district. They stopped at a narrow alley between two large buildings and turned down it. Thirty feet from the street Andras, Kat’s brother, bent and hauled at a cover plate in the center of the alley. With the help of her father they pried it up and dragged it aside to reveal a dank shaft dropping below the street. Her father shoved a small penlight into her hand and whispered, "Third panel down on the right. Should be a comm and security panel labeled with TecSec logos. Inside look in the upper section for Devis Partners links. Cut the security system in five minutes, then bring it back on in 40. I’ll drop your board and tools once you’re down. Buzz us once if anything doesn’t seem right. And for hell’s sake, don’t screw it up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Muck clung to her hands as she half slid half climbed down the ladder to the mud and oil covered tunnel below. She flashed the light once and her board dropped quickly down beside her. In moments she had it untied and the thin rope snaked back up into the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She found the panel easily enough, but just as she lined up her wrench and started to slip it over the first bolt she hesitated. Something didn’t look quite right. She slid the wrench back into her kit and grabbed a small screwdriver. Very gently she scraped at the accumulation of dirt and debris around the terminal box. A few minutes of work revealed the characteristic shape of the small anti-personnel charges of a security lid. She froze for long moments, staring at the charges and forcing herself to take deep, slow, calming breaths. Images of her sister’s coffin flashed through her mind. Then with hands gone suddenly shaky she returned the driver to her kit and started back to the ladder.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As soon as she had climbed to the alley she keyed her transmitter with the agreed trouble signal. A couple of minutes later her father and brother strode into the alley. Without even waiting for her explanation her father backhanded her against the wall of the nearest building. "You stupid bitch, why did you abort this job?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There was a security lid."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your sister wouldn’t have let that stop her. She’d have worked around it. I don’t know why I waste my time on a fuck up like you." They spent the trip home in silence.</p>

</br>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">She spent the next three days under the watchful eye of her father going over everything he knew about security lids and ways around them. Even though there weren’t many options he demanded she work them again and again. All the options required access to the cabling feeding the secured box. None of his methods provided any way of defeating the electronic lock on the lid itself. The unit he had her practicing on was one of the older models that still required outside power to drive the detonators. It had been one of the newer models with the internal backup power that had killed her older sister.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The third night they tried again. This time her father and brother followed her down the ladder and to the terminal box. He watched impassively as she cleared the debris from the junction box and the identifying plate for the lid. The serial numbers and model revealed it was one of the newest models of lid. "I’ll have a new plan by Monday," her father spit out before he stalked back to the ladder and up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next day she slipped out and headed for the river. Once again Sara was waiting in her clearing. "I wondered if you really would show up again. What happened to your face?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I crashed into a piece of workout gear at the gym."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I’ve never seen workout gear with fingers before. Who hit you, Kat? No one has the right to hit you like that!"</p>

</br>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">Kat and Sara continued to meet over the summer. Some times they would sit and talk, other times Kat would show her around various sections of the town. Once in a while Sara would slip her in to parts of the school and show her around. The computer labs fascinated Kat. A few times Sara would let her use her account and then watched enthralled as Kat easily learned the things it had taken her months to understand. By the end of the summer they were very close friends.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The end of summer brought another project for Kat’s father. This time he was supposed to infiltrate DevelStar and rewrite a couple of corporate tax documents. The changes would make the documents friendlier to the Chernikov family. This was the biggest challenge her father had faced yet, but the payoff would be enough money to buy a well appointed family enclave in one of the wealthier sections of the suburbs. As the project date approached her father became more and more tense. He stood over her and watched every move she made. He had her hack her way into various small companies and re-arrange their records, just to make sure she could. Any failure resulted in a beating. The severity increasing as the target date approached.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The day of the job her father fairly vibrated from tension. He paced, he sweated, he went over and over the plans until she was sure she would explode from the frustration of having to listen to him one more time. At last it was time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Armed only with her interface deck and view goggles she was dropped off first. It was easier than she expected to slip through the locks on the loading dock doors. In moments she was in the building and jacked in at the receiving computer station. From there she accessed the inner door alarms and slipped into the inner section of the complex. Dodging the security patrols was made easier by their sloppiness. Twenty minutes after her initial entry she was in the network control center and jacking into the main servers. Once she had the security systems altered it was time to wait until her father and brother accessed the backup storage vaults and replaced the backup sets. Then it would be her turn to modify the active file sets.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While she waited she kept running over her conversations with Sara in her head. Time and again Sara told her she didn’t have to put up with what she called her father’s abuse. Then she thought about how often he had hit her or beaten her during the preparation for this job. Almost before she realized she had made a decision her hands were dancing across the keyboard. First she reset the locks on the vaults, then she activated the alarms in that section. Finally she backed herself out of the security system and slipped out of the building. Her final act was to trigger the main alarms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As she hurried away from DevelStar she realized she’d been waiting for a chance to run for quite some time. Sara had helped solidify it by talking to her about how things weren’t right between her and her parents. The beatings and the opportunity to slow down her father had provided the chance. She was planning while she walked. She had to have food, but that wouldn’t be hard, there were plenty of ways to scam food. Getting away from town wouldn’t be hard either. She could easily catch a ride with any one of the laborer trucks heading out to the farms in the morning. Any of the farms wouldn’t notice an extra worker either. It would be simple work to slip into a group and get put on the payroll. All she had to do was avoid the city security forces until morning. Then avoid the Chernikovs until she could get out of town.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She started into the nearest alley and began working her way to the river. If she could slip onto the school grounds before a patrol caught her she could hide there until morning. It took a little longer than usual to get to the school. She’d had to dodge a couple of curfew patrols on her regular path. Her thoughts were still on her next steps as she neared her clearing so she didn’t see Sara until she heard a low gurgling moan. She spun, looking for the source of noise and stopped as she saw her. Her clothes were torn and blood oozed slowly from several large stab wounds in her chest. "Sara? Hang on, I’ll get help..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Erin did this..." dark bubbles formed around the words, followed by a weak cough that spilled blood over her battered lips.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sara, Sara, come on hang on." As Kat watched Sara’s chest stopped it’s small movement and the blood trickles slowed. Slowly Kat sank to her knees, her face held in her hands. Numbness washed through her as she continued to stare at the closest friend she’d ever had. A long time later a thought managed to slip its way through the fog and into consciousness. "I can get this Erin. What if Sara comes back? Erin thinks her dead..." she looked at Sara again, "I’m sorry, but we need to switch places and you need to disappear for a while." She carefully emptied Sara’s clothes of everything and pocketed the few items, including Sara’s school ID and keys. Then she slowly and carefully pulled the body toward the river, all the while chanting, "I’m sorry," over and over again under her breath. At the edge of the river she filled Sara’s clothes with whatever rocks they’d hold and rolled her into the river. "Goodbye, my friend. I’ll get Erin for you. I promise."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Swiftly she made her way to Sara’s dorm and slipped up the vines to her window. With quick, sure motions she popped the window open like she had many times before over the summer and slipped inside. Her motion to the desk lamp was halted by Tom’s voice from the bed. "What are you doing here? Where is Sara?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why are you here? Who is Erin?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was supposed to meet Sara at eight to help her with a programming assignment. Why do you want to know about Erin?" Suspicion suddenly colored his voice, "Something’s happened, hasn’t it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you trust me? Even a little?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Some..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I found Sara a little while ago, by the river, she’d been cut up pretty badly. Someone named Erin had done it to her. She died...she died after telling me..." Tears were running down her cheeks by now.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We’ve got to do something, tell someone. I’m going to call security right now!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"WAIT! Wait Tom. What will security be able to do? I’m not even supposed to be here. They’ll arrest me and ignore everything I say. They’ll pin this on me and they won’t even look for anything else. They won’t believe you either, you have no proof. But, we can get this Erin. Only you, Erin, and I know Sara’s gone. With your help I can pretend to be her until then."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's stupid. It'll never work. One check of your Ident and they'll know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, not if I fix the records."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can you do that?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, I can. I need a node, something more open than the terminal here, but I can do it. So, who is this Erin anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Erin’s this muscle man on campus whose convinced he’s the galaxy’s gift to women. He came on to Sara last year but she rebuffed him. Then he started getting mean, calling her names, trying to drive her friends away, which wasn’t really hard since she didn’t have any to start with other than me. Then he started rumors about her. He left for the summer and just arrived back a few days ago. He tried with her again and she was even more direct with him. He’s the head of a kind of gang here. They terrorize the younger kids and collect the prettiest girls, but I wouldn’t have thought he’d actually kill anyone. They fancy themselves computer geniuses and Sara showed them all up the first day of class. She said it was something you’d shown her. He was mad about that too, but I expected him to try and hack something she was into."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Here’s my plan - you are going to help me keep up in my classes, and you’re going to tell me as much about how Sara looked, behaved, and socialized on campus. I’m going to put myself in places where Erin and his crowd will see me. Then I’m going to wait and see what happens. With any luck he’ll start something and we can get him to reveal himself. Now, please tell me everything you can about Sara...and then tell me if the school keeps finger or retinal prints on its students."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The few remaining hours passed swiftly as Tom tried to remember everything he could about Sara at school. The picture that emerged for Kat was one of a shy, intelligent woman who tended to lose herself in the computer and science classes she was taking. He described Erin as much as he could and mentioned the hammer and microchip patch the gang members often wore. She had to keep reminding him to keep going when she casually hacked into the school computers and replaced Sara’s finger and retinal prints with her own. By the time morning dawned Tom had given her a quick rundown on where her classes were and helped her dress in a typical Sara costume. They agreed he would meet her at her room in the evening and try and help her with the classes she had throughout the day.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Most of the day passed in a haze for her. In every class she was hopelessly lost except for the computer security introductory class Sara had signed up for. It was in the security class that she first got a glimpse of Erin. He was about a foot taller than she was and built like a bull. His hair was blonde and his skin tanned the deep color of one of the hot worlds. He swaggered through the classroom as if he owned the place and flung himself down in one of the center front row seats. He didn’t even look around and so didn’t notice Kat sitting in a shadow in the back of the room.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Right on time the instructor, Grace Riplev, walked in and called up a display of a security front end. Kat instantly recognized it as a three year old TecSec low security front end. "Today we are going to analyze the basic properties of a security front end..." the Riplev began. Erin leaned back and yawned loudly, causing Riplev to look up and glance around the room. As she started to continue, Erin scraped his chair back and slid down until he could lean his head back and pretend sleep. A brief flash of anger whipped across Riplev’s face but she didn’t say anything, except to continue her lecture. Kat’s eyes began to droop as she droned on. Her lack of sleep and the lack of information conspired with the heat in the room to slip her almost into unconsciousness. She didn’t hear Riplev call on Erin and she didn’t hear him fumble around trying to say something at all about the system. At first she didn’t hear Sara’s name being called until the third, "Ms. Draybin, would you be kind enough to wake up long enough to analyse the problem I've presented?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It took her a few moments more to realize the comment was directed at her. Then she glanced at the display and immediately responded with the information she had absorbed from years of security hacking. "This is a TecSec low order protection system. It is customized by a basic encrypted database containing password and user information. The encryption levels are low. The database layout is non-randomized and thus very easy to crack. The front end has a built in over-ride code that could be customized by a good sec-admin, but usually isn’t. Even with the over-ride used to its full ability it is still ridiculously easy to break."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How would you attack it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know," snickers erupted from the class, "You haven't given me enough information."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What would you like to know?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do I have access to the facilities? Do I have access to an internal terminal or the system itself, or am I attacking from a remote location?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's say you have access to the facilities."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"During business hours, after hours, what type of security sweeps? Do I have access to the system hardware or only a terminal? Is this a general user system or an information technology administrative system?" Sarah noticed the class was watching her with surprise and new respect.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"After hours access with minimal security sweeps. You have access to the hardware. It is a stand alone system with user and admin accounts. It is networked but a workstation instead of a terminal."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"First I would check the area for something that had passwords written down. Then for personal items that might suggest a password. Failing that, I'd hex dump the database and use a basic decryption algorithm against it." Without even stopping she glanced briefly at the screen again and then said, "Given this configuration I would start with the string AATZ7861063BB/2 as the over-ride string, since that is the system default. If that didn’t work, I’d follow up with the current year, date, month and planet primary representative as a second guess. Failing that, I’d jack in and go for the database itself with a GSD 7A decrypter to save time, although a 3B would work, only much slower. Let’s see, oh yeah, it is usually a graft-on, a high level addition to the system OS that’s added after the system is built. This compromises it in a few other ways as well. If someone is fluent in the basic OS they can sometimes just shut the whole thing down. Structure wise it is extremely simplistic and worth mention only because it led the way to better designs." By the time she finished the entire room was staring at her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Been studying outside of class Ms. Draybin? I was just about to mention graft-ons, but I hadn’t yet. Thank you for leading into my next topic."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By now she was wide awake and realized the entire room was focused on her, Erin most of all. "Ummm...sure, no problems..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Adrenaline kept her awake for the rest of the class. When the bell signaled the end of class she jumped up, ready to sprint for the door. Just as she turned she heard Riplev’s voice, "Ms. Draybin, would you stay a moment please?" She debated running for it, then realized Sara never would have and slowly turned to walk back to the podium. "I’d like to know where you heard about Galactic Security Directorate decryption code levels. No one outside the GSD is even supposed to know there are decrypters above the 5D level. Also, where did you hear about the default over-ride strings? I haven’t covered that either. Yesterday you were taking frantic notes about everything I said, but today you are bored enough to drift off to sleep during lecture. You aren’t involved with sleep learning drugs are you? You know those are forbidden by school policy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh...after class yesterday I was so curious that I stayed up most of the night studying the book and several of your recommended resources. I must have heard someone mention GSD security protocols..." She tried to paste on a look of rapt admiration on her face as she continued, "You made everything sound so interesting yesterday that I just had to have more information. Unfortunately I stayed up way too late last night reading. I’m sorry I fell asleep."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nice try, but I know there is nothing in the resources I gave you that would give you the specifics you listed in class. Would you like to try again?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We could go see the Dean of Students and have you tested for learning drugs, or you could try again..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"OK, I had a friend who was a hacker and she told me about some of this. I didn’t want to look like I knew too much when classes started, but I stayed up too late last night and you caught me unawares."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A friend who’s a hacker...better..." she looked thoughtful for a moment, then continued, "You know, I’ve been looking for a Teaching Assistant for this semester. Since you seem so interested in this topic, how would you like to apply? I base my decision on ability and unfortunately Erin is currently the best candidate. He’s capable, but no one would get any help from him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What would I have to do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much, just analyze a couple of systems and tell me what you can determine about them. I don’t expect anything particularly in depth since we haven’t covered much yet, just a break down of the basic approach each one is derived from. The pre-requisites for this class should give you enough to work from."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds interesting...lead on! I don’t have another class until after lunch." Kat replied with a smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She led Kat to her office and motioned her into the chair at the terminal. She called up several different systems, all of them ones Kat had hacked for her father. It took only two examples before she was convinced. Rather than call up the rest of the test she called up several of her senior level and graduate class example systems. Kat carved her way through the senior ones with no trouble and the easier two of the graduate ones. It took Kat longer on the last two, but she managed to break them all down. Finally Kat looked up confused and asked, "This test is for beginners??"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Actually only the first two systems. You seemed to have so little trouble with them that I wanted to see what would challenge you. I don’t think you’ve done sleep drugs, they usually leave gaps in your knowledge that would have shown up by now. I don’t think you had a hacker friend either, you are just too good. You are extremely adept at security systems. How are you at programming?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not very good, I’m afraid. I can do simple scripting things to launch probe software and the like, but that’s about it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hmmm, well, for now, you have the TA position. I’ll post it in the morning and you can see me tomorrow after your last class. I’ll get you started and go over the first assignments. Just a simple graft-on with an over-ride string to be analyzed, you should be able to do it in your sleep..." She laughed. "I’ll let you know about the other stuff later. And discuss an independent study program to keep you from getting bored. Oh, and if you haven’t already guessed, watch out for Erin, he’s rather petty when he doesn’t get his way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">On her way out of the computer sciences building Erin slipped up beside her. "I don’t know who you are, but I know who you aren’t. One false step and your mine. If you want me to leave you alone come to my room tonight, after nine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nice try, but I don’t think you’ll find me as pliable as before. It would give me great pleasure to rip your beating heart from your chest and consume it before your dying eyes. Oh, and I wouldn’t count on the TA position in crypto class either..." With a cheerful wave she walked away, leaving him steaming behind her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Back at her room she found an envelope slipped under the door and Tom waiting inside. "How do you do it? My brain feels like mush. I have a program to write, 6 chapters total to read, and a three page paper to write before Friday. And this is only the second week?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You get used to it. You okay with the program?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, it’s a simple one, not a lot different than a scripting file. Although the symbols are more cryptic. Save your help for later in the semester, when I’m totally lost. I saw Erin today. He seemed somewhat disturbed to see me, but he covered it by demanding I show up at his room. What a scum-bag! He’s creepy." As she was talking she was also tearing the envelope open. Inside was a single page note from the dorm advisor informing her she would be getting a roommate, by the name of Amanda Moore-Clarke, the next day. "Oh great, now I get a roommate on top of everything."</p>

</br>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">She didn’t have much time to concentrate on Erin. Most of her time was taken up trying to keep up enough to not flunk out of school. She and Tom became nearly inseparable. Amanda turned out to be another computer science/cryptography student transferring from another school. She was another source of help for Kat, although Kat only used her for more normal sounding kinds of help. The two of them became even closer than she and Tom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Grace Riplev added another complication when she offered Amanda and Kat jobs working on her crypto research projects. Erin was furious when he found out. His disruptions in class increased until Riplev requested the presence of a security person to keep class order.</p>

</br>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">After a month and a half Kat had learned enough to add an embedded updater worm into a routine records transfer to the galactic administrative services. It was constructed to force a system update on Tri-Devron system and on Sara’s home world of Merrakesha. When it was done it had replaced all Sara’s identity records with hers.</p>

</br>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">One month later she was leaving the cryptography labs late at night after a particularly long day when Erin struck. As Kat walked out the side entrance he stepped out of the nearby shadows and swung a heavy pipe into the back of her head. She dropped like a rock as he dropped the pipe and fled into the night. Tom arrived a few minutes later, on his way to pick her up for more late night tutoring, this time for her basic biology class. At first he was certain she was dead. There was blood pooled under her head and a big dent in the back of her skull. It wasn’t until he heard a faint rattling breath that he realized she was still alive.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Within moments he was at the door of the crypto building and banging on it for all he was worth. It seemed an eternity until a security guard arrived to quiet him. As the door swung open he was already screaming, "Call emergency services, a girl’s been attacked. She’s been hit in the head. Tell them to hurry!"</p>

</br>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">A week later Kat slowly regained consciousness. At first her vision was blurred and distorted, but slowly it began to clear, except for the traceries of multicolor streamers near lights and other electronic equipment. She blinked again, trying to bring the room into focus and banish the traceries. It mostly worked, bringing an older, worried looking female face into focus. "You’re awake! Your father and I were worried about you when we heard. We couldn’t stay away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wha..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Your father is talking with your doctors. We weren’t expecting you to wake up for a while yet. But since you are...you’re going to be fine! I’m afraid you’re going to need extensive therapy, but you’ll be fine in no time. Shhh, no don’t talk yet, there are some things I need to tell you. You were in bad shape when you were found. Whoever attacked you crushed the back of your skull and severed your spinal cord. You’ve taken extensive damage to your cerebellum and occipital lobe and there was damage to your brain stem. They were going to use the tissue samples we took from you when you were young to re-grow the damaged areas, but something must happened at the storage facility. When they inserted the growth culture, you rejected it. There wasn’t time to process another culture, so we made a decision. Your father is going to take you home with us for a little bit and install a PsyberTech unit in place of the damaged tissue." Kat’s eyes widened at the news. The woman held up her hand and rushed on, "Please, wait before you say anything. We know how much you hate cyberware but it was the only way to save your life. What we thought was we could stabilize you until we could get you home, then we can install the unit. Later we can take cultures directly from you and try to do the re-growth there. We have done a lot of thinking since you left and realize how wrong we have been trying to control your future the way we were. We’d like you to come home again..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">'So, Sara hated cyberware, I would have killed for implants, any implants...now I’m being offered a PsyTech model...' Kat thought, not quite hearing that Sara’s mom had stopped speaking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see, you haven’t forgiven us..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, yes I have...I...I’m just trying to adjust, that’s all. This is a lot of change all at once. I’ve had some time to think too. I realize that cyberware isn’t the evil I had thought. I can adapt to the changes, but I’d like to return here and finish my schooling." She thought for a moment and asked, "What kind of cyberware will I need, and what type of therapy am I looking at?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"PsyberTech Gamma Zeta eighty-seven Alpha. I’m afraid the damage means you’ll have to learn to walk and move again. Most of the damage was to the motor skill sections of your brain. I’ll let your father explain the cyberware. It’s his latest design. One more thing, there’s a very nice young man outside waiting for you to wake up. He has left only to go to classes, and not many of them since they brought you in. You should thank him, he was the one who found you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Could I see him? For a few minutes anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Sure, I’ll send him in and see if I can track down your father." Sara’s mom left and soon Tom walked in.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, that must have been interesting...at least you have a good excuse if you aren’t what they remember. It was Erin, wasn’t it?"
</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, it was. He caught me coming out of the crypto labs. Gods, I couldn’t believe my luck though, if I hadn’t managed that forced update there would certainly have been more questions around the tissue rejections. And a PsyTech cyberware implant, do you know how much I wanted one of those? Now they’ve given me the newest Gamma Zeta system available! Why didn’t you tell me I hated cyberware?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It didn’t seem important at the time. I didn’t expect you to need any and I didn’t expect you to get your parents here either. You weren’t on very good terms with them before. I wish I had been there a few minutes earlier, then maybe this wouldn’t have happened."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It wouldn’t have mattered, he’d have gotten to me eventually anyway. You DID get there soon enough to save my life."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You scared all of us. No one knows how you managed to stay alive. All the nerves between your brain and the rest of your body had been severed. Yet you were still breathing and your heartbeat was strong and steady."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don’t ask me, I don’t remember anything after I stepped out the door and saw him swinging."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is some other news. An anonymous tip was called in to the local authorities and to school security about a body in the river. Tentatively it’s been identified as a Katerina Valinovskya. They’re looking for clues to who killed her. So, Sara, all you need to do now is tie it to Erin. By the way, I like the new you. You’ve come a long way out of your shell this semester."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks. It’s been an interesting time."</p>

</br>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">Later Sara’s father came in and sat down next to the bed. "We need to talk. I know you are not my daughter. It was easy really. First there was the genetic mis-match, then while I was waiting for them to stabilize you there were all the people worried about you. Several of your instructors and a few students were hanging out waiting. My daughter never had that many friends. My daughter also was a poor student who excelled at nothing. Everyone had high praise for your abilities, particularly with computers. Sara only tolerated computers."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No sir, I’m not your daughter. I am afraid your daughter is dead. The person who did this killed her several months ago. I found her and decided to masquerade as her long enough to trap him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I hope you realize just how stupid that was."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes sir, I do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And don’t call me sir, this isn’t the military. I don’t know how I feel about all this yet. I may never know. What I have come to do is make you an offer. I will save your life. In return you will do two things for me. I am going rebuild your brain and skull using an experimental cyberware unit, a GZ87a. What you will do is stay alive and sane. This unit is based on the same technology that was used in the stealth force experiment on Jaranthas. I’m sure you heard about how disastrous that was. This is a new design, but if I can’t prove it works, I’ll lose all funding. The second thing you will do is return to school here and pick up as much as possible about the Security Service training and plans. I know you’re in tight with Grace Riplev. You will also continue to masquerade as Sara for your mother. If you agree to these terms you will return with us to B’Zeta and the PsyberTech facility there long enough for the rebuild and the therapy that comes after."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">after the implant</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">Sara’s mother came into her room late after the final surgery was finished. "Sarah, there are some things I need to tell you about the implant and the surgeries you’ve been going through. At first we thought we would only have to add the implant, but once we started it turned into a long list of mods to support the previous mods. When you finish the therapies you will be ten to thirty percent stronger and faster than normal women of your size. You will also be about thirty percent heavier. There is another thing you should know. Right now you will be more sensitive to heat than regular people. The cyber-gear we have given you increases the heat generation of your body by ten percent and even with the additional cooling methods we have added you run serious risk of heat stroke in higher temperatures. Dry heat won’t be as bad for you as damp heat. For example you could probably do very well on Seconus 3 but the high humidity heat of Moloch Instantious would be very difficult." As she talked she paced around the room, seeming to be fighting with herself. At last she stopped detailing technical changes and moved close to Valen’s bed. "I know you aren’t my daughter, although I really wish you were. You are what I always wished she could be. I won’t tell your father, I don’t want to hurt him with that, but I want to know why you are here in her place."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"He knows. Could you call him in and I'll explain what happened." Once both her new parents were in the room, she explained how she had met Sarah, how they had become friends, and how she had discovered her after Erin's attack. "She was the best friend I ever had and I miss her terribly. I wanted revenge. What I did was crazy, stupid, and very dangerous, but I wanted that sick piece of filth to pay for what he did to my friend. I am sorry for what I've put you through. If I'd thought about this more carefully, you wouldn't be here dealing with me, although, Sarah would still be dead and the scum would be less close to punishment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Valen on killing</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I don't regret the actual killing, I regret the ripples of sdaness to the living. The dead was someone's son or daughter, lover, father or mother, some cared for them and loved them regardless of or before what they had become.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Valen on early childhood</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Father killed mother, she and sister lived in fear of father and brother, Sarah was first real friend, should describe some of this to new parents as reason she went after killer. Consider, how well is she able to band with new parents, given early hostory, does cyberware and brain damage help or hurt?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Valen on cyberware build-out and infiltrator mode</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I was built and trained as an infiltrator, but I hated it. You slide in, gain confidences, lie, cheat, and conspire until you have the data you need, then betray your target. I always felt dirty once I was done. On occasion, the target was nasty enough that I felt relief at the betrayal point, but most times, they were good people, caught in bad situations and inconvenient to those in power at the time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/-----------------</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Seconus 4 - First mission</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">/-----------------</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Icicle</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After Seconus 4 Sarah was assigned to the more difficult and complex missions. She would always manage to succeed, sometimes against incredible odds. Yet as her portfolio grew so did her discontent. More and more she realized her missions were dictated by political expedience rather than any real threat to Alliance security. One mission would have her destroying rebels fighting for citizen rights, the next she would be supporting others with almost exactly the same needs.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When the Icicle hoax mission came up she was tired and confused by it all. This one involved the faking of advanced alien tech and data by a person or persons on the resource world of Icicle. Icicle was a DevelStar holding but it was more autonomous than most because it was beyond the normal holdings and a low producer besides. Its products were just important enough to not close it down, but not sufficient to justify much expense on management or development either.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Someone there had sent an odd bit of technological equipment and several images of a ship buried in a section of ice. The artifact and images were supposed to demonstrate that another civilization had seeded various Alliance worlds with the beginnings of the races that originated there. The political and social tensions this would have caused were reason enough to prompt a search and destroy mission.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After the Seconus episode I began to notice the true randomness of the assignments. One time we would be sent to stop an uprising, the next assignment would be to create on. More and more it became obvious that we were being used to promote political expedience, not any rational plan for security or assistance. It all came to a head when I received the Icicle assignment.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The official word was there was a threat to Alliance security posed by a hoax originating on Icicle. Someone on Icicle had sent a bogus artifact to the Antiquities board claiming it was from a lost alien civilization. The experts had decided it was a hoax and a threat to Alliance stability because it called into question the beliefs of many Alliance cultures. The council decided the artifact was to be destroyed and the perpetrators of the hoax were to be silenced.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Within days I was "transferred" to Icicle as a low ranking soldier at the Extreme Cold Research facility the Alliance military had on Icicle. Over the next several months I slowly slipped into the local society. Most Iciclers are friendly but reserved. They will help each other and support each other since survival depends on looking out for each other. At the same time they are wary of off-worlders. My training was as a maintenance yard person, fixing various vehicles and other mechanical things. It was a weak cover but the training was good enough that I was just good enough to not arouse too many questions.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">My mission was to track down the persons who had created the artifact and images that had been sent out. The image sources were to be destroyed and the persons responsible terminated.</p>
