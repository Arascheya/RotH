<p class="pagecaption">Void</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The mist was warm on my skin and with it came a brief sense of falling. We emerged into swirling black and green fog. There was no road, no landscape, nothing but swirling mists, too thick to see more than a few feet in front of the horses. My chest tightened and black spots danced across my vision. The horses had changed into coal black beasts that snorted green fog, Their manes, tails, and the feathers around their feet had become strands of green smoke, dancing in a hidden breeze. The green around us was warm and soft and comforting in a creepy, odd way.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As blackness closed in and my eyes lost focus, I saw a thick green line stretching off in front of us. It ran straight under the vardo and between the horses and pulsed in a chasing light kind of way. Focusing on it drew my mind away from the panic and roused my curiosity. "What is that?" I asked, pointing at the line.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What?" Yara asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The green line running under the wag..vardo."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned to stare at me. "You can see that? What else do you see?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh," I tried to unfocus my eyes again. Things snapped into focus, "I see a pulsing energy from our vardo, echoed in the others. If I look just right I can see our line of vardos and the line stretching behind and in front. Is it some kind of guide? Is that why we are following it?" Other things slowly came into focus as well. "There are streamers of green coming from the mists and touching us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you see in the void around us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Fainter lines, radiating out, not quite like a compass but more like crossroads. The mists are thicker and thinner in spots and to our left is a darker patch. Would that be a connection to another place?" The words bubbled up in my mind from somewhere deep, somewhere I hadn't known existed. "How am I knowing this?" Fear tinge my voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are a sensitive, a void walker. Some are born with the knowledge. I have no idea how, it just is. With practice, you could walk through this dimension the way others would stroll in a familiar park, at home and always certain of where you are. You are right, the spot to our left is a gate to another place but it is not our destination. To move through the void you focus your mind on the destination and then follow the faint line to it. If you lose your focus you can become lost. Sometimes a lost one can find a door to a realm, other times they wander lost until they are no more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't bullshit me. Anything I can do, someone else can do better. I'm just a common whore." Her words had tempted me for a moment to abandon my reality, but I knew better.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A 'common whore', let's look at that. You have to read the client, make sure you know what he or she wants, make sure they won't hurt you, and make them happy. You wear costumes to entice and provoke and you have to be able to fake arousal and interest, even on a bad day. You could be an ambassador, an actress, or a costumer easily. In darker circles you could be an infiltrator, spy, or assassin. You didn't go insane crossing into the void, most would have. I'd say you are pretty extra-ordinary, actually."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I rolled my eyes at her words. She was talking the same type of craziness Tony had. It amazed me how many people wanted to mold me, make me into something, and layer on the expectations. She must have seen my eyes move because her hand shot out and gripped my chin. She yanked my head around with a surprisingly strong pull. "You are more than you think. You deserve more than you realize, and I will not have you squander yourself, if you desire to remain with the carnival."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Squander myself? There's nothing left to squander," the bitterness in my voice surprised me as much as it did her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mere words won't convince you. I've seen that before, too many times, on too many worlds. You will be expected to work while you are here. You may be Silent or Speaker, although, I recommend Silent to start. Unless you have a speaking performance you would wish to offer up?" My confusion must have shone on my face because she offered an explanation, "Silent are the ones you saw with the white masques. They are not permitted to speak, but either perform silently or function as rousties and other support. There are speaking acts, but many find the burden of not speaking of the carnival harder if they can speak."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have no performance to offer."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is fine. Many come to us without performance skills. Some develop something as they travel, others are content to be support for the performers. You shall be known as Mayfly, newcomer, until such time as you have learned our ways and found a niche you can fill. At that time you will be known by a name of your choosing. Your past is yours, to be disclosed or withheld at your desire. None will demand it of you. As a mayfly, you will be expected to do anything that is asked of you. In your case, that will not include the giving of sexual favors. You will entertain none that way until you have a true sense of your value. I shall give you a jar of the masque, the white face paint, that the Silent wear. It will produce a pattern that is unique to you when you apply it. I will also give you a teaching gem that will give you the sign, music, and movement language of the Silent. There is a small bed cabin in the rigging vardo that will be yours, until we find a better place for you. Do you have any questions about this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"True value..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Stop. Don't even start to speak of that. You do not know yourself well enough to speak on that matter." A chill rippled through me."I have rendered you silent. To use the teaching crystal, place it against the bridge of your nose, right between your eyes. It will be quite intense, so I would recommend waiting until we have set camp and you are in your bed before using it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I opened my mouth to reply, but nothing came out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"There is one other thing. You are not a prisoner, or bound to us in any way, save your own will. If you wish to leave the carnival, you may do so in any realm we are visiting. Choose carefully though, some can be extremely harsh to women."</p>
