<p class="sectioncaption">Things to remember throughout</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* maybe this person is very damaged and broken - might be good to explore some of the demons that are plaguing more now than before */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider PinkLlama for face and body type - Alex might have a bit more meat on her bones, but could be that thin and a bit twitchy from her background */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* uses splinteres under her nails after her father breaks her nose for cutting on herself - finds the ability to minutely control the pain to be an "exquisite addition" to the process - Tony tries to get her to stop, with limited success */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* need to figure how long she stays with Tony and what breaks them up - although, it is most likely her negative self image and lack of ambition/interest in most of life */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider father runs "gentleman's club" across from the local cemetary */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* personality should be hard, distant, and a bit blood-thirsty - she doesn't let people very far in and it is a strength and a weakness for her */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* the Carnival can be a balancing force, both through data transfer and assassination of unbalancing influences - Yara has close ties with Irena and the master Hut */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* first world after assimilatoin in the void, then to the "winter quarters" for a bit. This is when she first sees Yara and Valen talking */</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>


</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">Things to consider revising</p>

<p class="regtxt5">consider adding a synchronizer to the Dark Carnival - this person uses dance to sync a local timeline to the carnival and allows the carnival to modify the local timeline. she is usually preforming in the common areas of the carnival. she is a silent and does not have a scheduled act. it is her job to maintain sync during the carnival's time in the local realm. Kayara cannot be the synchronizer, so need to develop a different character for this role. could use images of J. Batter from Ink as a visual model for this character</p>


</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">Conversations</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Commerce</p>

<p class="regtxt9">ALEX: The catch phrase of my world was 'How can we make them pay' and it was applied to everything. If a thing didn't have a dollar value, it was worthless. Hell, I was a commodity. Twenty-five dollars for a blowjob, fifty for a quick fuck, seventy-five for a blowjob and fuck, and two hundred fifty dollars for all night.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">KARYNE: What about love?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">ALEX: It was packaged and sold from cards, candy, and flowers at 'required' times of the year to pornography and hookers. Some of my regular clients even thought they were in love with me, but they still had to pay.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">TORI: That's awful! What about love between family members?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">ALEX: I wouldn't know. All I saw was the way my father expected any woman, from his wife to his daughter, to be available for sale when needed. Incest was a big seller in the porn markets too.</p>

</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She becomes linked to the gate dimension when she breaks the tracking link to the Carnival.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She leaves her void self behind when crossing into the realms after the first attunement - this leaves her washed out, empty, and exhausted. Could have her fragment into RGB on the first entry to the realms or just collapse</p>

<p class="regtxt5">needs to figure out how to keep herself together when entering the realms</p>

<p class="regtxt5">figures out how to use void worms as spy tools - can implant them into targets, then see through them - does not allow effecting the target, just monitoring</p>

<p class="regtxt5">can become etherial or astral in the realms - the R and B parts of her segmentation</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider this section on religion - could come out while talking to Karyne and Tori during a camp or in transit. Could be prompted by a Mayfly that comes from a religious background, or is talking about it</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The universe is far more of a miracle if it evolved by itself. Having something create it reduces the wonder. Any intelligence can concoct something, but random evolution of life is fucking amazing.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Humans are one of the better arguments against creation or intelligent design. Many of the flaws, oddities, and poorly designed systems make a lot more sense in a random evolution model.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Relying on some cosmic force to solve problems and force people to be good cheapens the beauty of kindnesses performed for their own sake. Which is more sincere, an act of true kindness or an act of kindess done to curry favor or out of fear of reprisal?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The tough love of any human tends to be more humane and caring than the "love" exhibited by the sky gods of the dominant religions. If "imperfect beings" can manage love, why does a "god" have to be such an ass about it?</p>

<p class="regtxt9">It is a truly sad commentary on humanity that it takes coersion and fear of some fantasy being and fantasy place of torment to promote good behavior. It is also a sad commentary that it is easier to rely on a fantasy being for good things in life than it is to rely on each other.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">The whole concept of terrible things happening as a "test" or "growth promoting experience" is just sick. Better to explain it as a random act of an unthinking universe, it makes it far less personal and targetted that way.</p>


</br>
<p class="sectioncaption">Insertable Segments</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I hate humans because they make me afraid. Humans in groups will always default to the easy, stupid, greedy solution. And if you are different, well, you must be expelled, shit on, made to feel inferior, and bullied for the few things you might have. Sometimes individuals will rise above themselves, but groups will not. I hate being afraid all the time. I hate walking near a group and wondering what they will do or say that will threaten my existence. The guys I see at work are the worst. Money on the table and they can treat me any way they like. Usually it's pinch, squeeze, thrust a few times, then walk away. Some hit or insult because they are too drunk to perform and, somehow, it's my fault. I would kill them all, if only it would stop me being afraid.</p>
