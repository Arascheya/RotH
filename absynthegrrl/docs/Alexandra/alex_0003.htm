<p class="regtxt5">The next months passed quickly. I learned how to set up and strike the tents and how to pack a vardo in the most efficient way. There was training in knots and rigging and the care of the void beasts and other animals. I fetched, carried, and sweated under the orders of the other carnies and slowly learned the trade.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I found I had a knack for rigging. Any of the riggers could get the trapeze and high wires competently set up, but somehow I could add just a little extra perfection. My skills were sought more and more as I became confident and trained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As time went by I found I missed stripping. It surprised me, but I missed knowing every eye in the room was on me and that my actions were arousing them, making them crave me. I didn't miss the whoring, or the knowledge that the exchange of a few dollars would give me to one of my audience.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When we were camped in the void I would slip between the vardos, walk just out of sight of camp, and run through some of the old routines. No one would disturb me. Most of the carnies were afraid of the void and the beasts they believed lived in it. There were beasts, but they seemed more curious than fierce. I would sometimes see them lingering in the shadows as I stripped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As the months marched on, the void touched me. I found I could call things from it when I had longed to do a pole routine. Suddenly a pole formed from the mist, greyish green and solid. Working with it again aroused me and I had to give myself release before returning to the camp. Another time I was relaxing from a particularly intense orgasm when my mind wandered and I found myself staring at myself from the eyes of one of the creatures. After that, it became easier and easier to slip the bonds of my mind and wander through the mists as one of the creatures. Our camp was a spot of oddness intruding on the order of the mist, making it very easy to find.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The void worms were the most friendly and the easiest to slip into. They looked like long, greenish scaled eels, floating in the void and moving about by flicking their finned tails. Once I was familiar with the slipping of my bonds, I spent long times drifting through the void in the minds of these simple creatures. It was an amazing place, filled with a vast ecosystem of creatures and organisms. Our camps were tolerated because we were respectful and left them alone. In the dim recesses of some of the more intelligent creatures I could find echoes of travellers that had not been tolerated. Without powerful defenses, they were soon overwhelmed and destroyed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yara summoned me to her vardo eight months after I left with the carnival. She motioned me to the bed, handed me a cup of tea, and said, "Congratulations. You have passed the initiation period and may choose your name. Do you have one you would desire?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I signed back, "Alex, mistress."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alex it shall be. Do you desire better quarters?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I thought about my tiny space, located at the front of the rigging vardo. It was small, just enough room for a bed, a long drawer under the bed frame, a hook for a small lantern, and a place to hang a few clothes or costumes. Most of my time was spent in the circle with the rest of the carnival, in the mists, or working. "No, mistress. My space is enough for my needs."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you know yourself well enough to assess yourself now?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not yet, mistress."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I would like to promote you to master rigger, would that be acceptable to you, Alex? The others speak highly of your skill and the twins trust you more than anyone else."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My head shook violently even before my fingers lept into sign. "No, I don't want the responsibility for the rest of the riggers as well as myself. I don't want to be the one at fault if anything bad happens."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I understand, but let me ask you something. How often do the others come to you and have you check their work? How often does Karetha ask you to double check her? How often do you have to ask her for help? Leadership isn't about giving orders as much as it is about inspiring your team to be as good as they can. By making your team look good, you inspire them to make you look good. Karetha is returning to the Realms since her supplicancy with the Form Dancers is complete. I could advance Arturius, but he's not nearly as good as you and he's more likely to piss off the rest of the riggers rather than help them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Think about it for a little while before you decide. If you feel insecure about your abilities, remember you have a team with enough talent to check your work and back you up. That's what I do with the carnival. It is rare I will make a major decision without input from the rest of you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I bowed my head briefly, then signed back, "I'll let you know tomorrow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rest of the day and into the evening I talked with the other riggers, talked to Karyne and Tori, the acrobat twins, and some of the other performers as well. All of them were in agreement that I should step up. The twins were the most vocal, describing several times Arturius would have killed them if Karetha or I hadn't found his errors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After a night of restless dreams and little sleep, I approached Yara and waited for her to acknowledge me. Once she did, I signed, "I am honored by the trust of the carnival and your belief in me. I accept the promotion to Master Rigger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Excellent! Thank you for accepting, Alex. I will make the formal announcement at fire time tonight." She hugged me tight and smiled.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"May I tell the twins before tonight?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Of course. You should enjoy sharing good fortune with friends."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The twins, Karyne and Tori, were the premier acrobats and high wire workers of the carnival and they were also my closest friends. They had been the first to invite me into the circle, the first to talk to me, and the first to honestly welcome me into the fold. They were overjoyed at my promotion and insisted on a celebratory drink from the treasured bottle of herbal liquor from their homeland. It was not replaceable, their world having been reshaped by wars of complete devastation. Nothing had remained of their life there when the carnival had last visited.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The welcoming party, started soon after Yara made the announcement to the camp, lasted long into the night. Various substances were passed, all relaxing in various ways. I was hovering half way between awake and asleep when one of the void worms started knocking on my mind. It would bump against my thoughts, then back away a short distance, then bump again. I let my mind wander into it and it took off like an arrow, straight back along the path we had followed. Half a day's journey behind us was a glaring spot of wrong in the mists. Twenty men sat around fires or paced on guard. We drifted closer, until I could make out the words of the argument near one of the fires. "We should go back. The further we are from the gate, the more dangerous it gets."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bah, I'll not let those dirty vagabonds steal my wife and child. You, wizard, how close are we?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I remembered this person. We had been in a very backward realm, where women were brood mares and children were property. The wife of this particular petty noble had begged sanctuary with the carnival. Yara had granted it to her and her daughter. He had decided to challenge this in the carnival grounds, where the Ky'ris, the final justice of the carnival, was the law. The rousties had ejected him from the grounds and barred his entry. For the rest of our stay he had hovered just outside the grounds, threatening and insulting the carnival and any who entered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Less than a day," a third voice spoke. "The tracking item I planted inside your daughter is working well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wish I could say the same about our tether. It's stretched very long right now," the first voice added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It will hold," replied the third voice. "You're too nervous about this. I've traveled the gates many times. As long as we stay in our circle and the protections of the tether hold, we are safer than being home."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The void creatures were gathering beyond the edge of their circle. Many were the void worms, like the one I was riding, but others were nastier, larger, with claws and fangs, and a hunger for things not of the void. We drifted closer so I could count the number of men in the camp. The first voice looked up, glared right at me, and fired something from his ring. Pain exploded through me and faded to merciful blackness.</p>
