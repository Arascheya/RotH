<p class="regtxt5">The blackness receeded slowly. Candle light flickered in the background and a hand held mine. Another hand gently touched my cheek, stroking softly. I tried to speak, but words wouldn't come, causing me to panic, until my mind caught up with me. With it came the memories of the pursuers. I sat up quickly, then crashed back down as my head spun.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Karyne signed, "Easy. We don't know what happened to you. One minute you were staring into the mists, the next, you had fallen unconcious. You are in our vardo."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yara, please, I must talk to Yara," I tried to rise again. This time I almost made it before dizziness pushed me back down. Tori nodded and left. I felt a small breeze as the door opened. Their vardo was sparse, like everyone's. There were a few items that made it theirs, a doll on a wire, a fan of peacock feathers, a brightly patterned quilt on the wider than normal bed, and a poster that must have been for something they had done in one of the realms. Oil lamps hung from hooks and a small fire burned in the stove.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Yara came in and moved to the bed. "What is it, Alex? What has happened?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are being followed. The noble from the last town and wizards. They want his wife and daughter back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And how do you know this?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I tried to explain the mists, the worms, and my ability to ride in their minds, but the silent language didn't have the words. After I had tried for several minutes, Yara motioned and then said, "You may speak. Try this in words."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It tumbled out in a rush, the dancing by myself, the experiments, the riding, and finally the scene of the camp behind us.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What would you recommend?" Yara asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Me?" her question startled me into silence.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You, mist walker, what would you do?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'd try to break their tracking link with our newest members and let them go back or search blindly for us. I might try and break their tether, but that would likely end them. The creatures are circling the camp hungrily. A disruption and they would feed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok. Karyne, would you get Mishana?" Karyne nodded and hurried out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't break the link, Yara," Mishana answered after learning of the situation. "It is between blood. The only ways I know of would be to kill the daughter or kill the father."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A crazy plan was forming in my mind as they talked. Yara and Mishana were still discussing options when they left. I asked Karyne to help me back to my vardo, not wanting to take up space in theirs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once they had left me, I slipped back out. Moving from shadow to shadow, I slipped out of the circle and into the void. It took very little time to find the tracking link. I kicked off my boots, dug my toes into the fabric of the mists, and wrapped my hands around the tracking link. It was warm and pulsing in my hands. An image formed in my mind of taking the energy of the link and directing it through myself and into the fabric of the void. I was sure if I did things correctly that I could prevent harm to the daughter while grounding out the tracking energy. The link grew warm in my hands. Soon it was hot, then fire erupted on my hands, hot red flame, sizzling the flesh, charing it until it blistered and split. Pain, the likes of which I never knew, seared up my nerves. The flames spread, consuming me. The tendons of my hands shrunk, pulling my grip tighter and tighter on the brand. My mouth opened in a silent scream as a greenish flash blasted across my eyes and I dropped into darkness again.</p>
