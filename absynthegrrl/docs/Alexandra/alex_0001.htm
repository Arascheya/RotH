<p class="pagecaption">Beginnings</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sex with Tony was the first time I had willing sex and the first time I had an orgasm with a partner. Tony was sweet and kind and lied to me with conviction. He told me I was pretty, that he liked me, and that he was happy just being with me. How he could find my generic angular face, crooked nose, broken by my father when I was thirteen because he found me cutting on myself, and skinny body pretty, showed the depth of his lies. When it came time to let him have me, I started to strip and lay back, but he stopped me. He pulled me back up and slowly undressed me, paying incredible attention to me. I hadn't realized how good another person's touch could feel before that. Once he had me undressed, he licked and kissed his way down my body, paying a lot of attention to the dirty place down below. I tried to stop him, but he claimed to really like my taste and enjoyed what he was doing. He gave me the first real orgasm of my life. I lay there, expecting him to pound into me, but he pulled me up again and had me settle down on him, instructing me to control our pace, how far he went in, and how much of me he could easily touch.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tony was a beautiful black boy, tall, muscular, and sweet. He had been on the varsity basketball team before he graduated. Girls would line up to be noticed by him. It always puzzled me that he would settle for a skank like me when he could have had his pick of the best. I knew him from school, but we didn't meet until he came to the Top Hat Club, the "gentleman's club" my father ran. It was a sleaze-pit located next to the old cemetery. My father's family had been running it for several generations. He said it was near the cemetery because no one would complain about the music or what happened at the club.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tony had come in with a group of friends, on a dare. He was a year ahead of me in school but we hooked up anyway. He wanted me to tell him where I wanted to go, what I wanted to be, and how to point my future. I couldn't come up with anything. Where would a cum-dumpster fit in his world? Why should any of it matter? I didn't have any skills. What good grades I had gotten had been because most of my teachers couldn't resist tits and a cunt in a short skirt. The biggest fights we had were over my future.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My father paid enough protection to the cops and the local mob bosses that he could run a whore house under the guise of a gentlemen's club. I was sucking cock by the time I was thirteen and fucking from the time I was sixteen. My father had taught me how to pleasure men and my mother taught me how to fake orgasms, flaunt my assets, and keep the men happy.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The other big fights Tony and I had were over sex. I was used to most guys being led around by their dicks and just wanting a warm gash to put it in. Tony wanted sex to be special. He thought I shouldn't just give myself to him unless we had some connection, some attachment of some form. I never really understood what he wanted, but I managed to fake it well enough for him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We kept seeing each other after he graduated. I threatened to run away to him once. My father asked me how I would feel, knowing I had caused Tony's death. I never made the threat again, but would see Tony whenever I could. I expected him to run from the threats, but he kept seeing me and kept trying to tell me how to escape.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had come home early on All Hallows Eve because Tony and I had another fight. I had been over at his place and he had been pressuring me about school again. I was always nervous and uneasy around All Hallows Eve, so it was more irritating than usual. After the third time he asked where I was going after high school I stood up and walked out. On the way back to my place I stopped at the chapel in the cemetery. It was usually locked, but one of the grounds keepers liked me and had gotten me a spare key. I'd slip inside and sit silently in the back, soaking in the quiet. It was the only place where no one would bother me. Sometimes Shyrel, the grounds keeper, would come in and we'd sit or talk quietly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The sun was setting and an enormous harvest moon was rising over the graveyard when I slipped back outside and started for home. A chill wind skittered the fallen leaves across the cemetery and around my feet as I walked rapidly through the fading light. A sense of anticipation climbed my back. It wasn't for the night, I knew I'd be instructed to wear one of the almost naked Hallows Eve costumes my father favored. It was something else, a sensation without focus.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There were a few themed decorations and lights adorning the otherwise square white building housing the club and our house. It was three stories, with the club area, kitchen, and storage on the first floor. The changing rooms were in the basement, except for mine, which was also my bedroom on the third floor, in the family section. There was an office, lounge, and a few private rooms on the second floor. Patrons could rent one of the rooms, with one of us, for anywhere from an hour to all night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A puff of wind whistled around my legs as I slowly approached the back door. Entering meant I would have to get ready for the evening and I wasn't quite ready yet. The rustle of paper caught my attention and I reached without looking to pick it up. My hand came up with a bright pink flyer instead of the expected trash. "Carnival" was written across the top, with various line drawings of animals and performers underneath. "All Hallows Eve only, from nightfall until the following dawn, Miller Park parking lot. Admission: two coins of your choosing." I crumpled it as I walked to the door and to my room but stopped just before throwing it away. I smoothed it back out and left it on the bed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The night was long and tedious. A frat party had come in around midnight, still dressed in costume, and already staggering drunk. They were loud, rude, and rough. The bruises on my ass and tits would take days to fade. Normally my father would stay open as long as he could milk cash from the patrons, but this crowd had him closing down at two-thirty, just to get them out the door. He wasn't angry that all of us had refused the propositions they had been making, even though it would have meant more money.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The paper crackled when I fell back on my bed. I looked at it once more, convinced it had to be a joke, but still unable to put it from my mind. After staring at the ceiling, waiting for sleep for over an hour, I rose, dressed and slipped out. The truck was the easiest to hot wire, old enough to not have a locking steering wheel, and simple wiring. It was a few minutes drive to Miller Park.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I rounded the corner and followed the road down the cut, under the freeway, and into the Miller Park lot. A circle of gypsy wagons greeted me, sitting in the center of the acres of parking. They weren't converted motor homes, but the older, horse drawn style, painted in bright patterns and fitted with intricate carvings and ornamentation. Music, violin, drum, and flute mostly, drifted on the breeze. There were no rides, no garish neon lights, and no thumping generators spewing exhaust. Torches and fire pits threw flickering light over a scene out of a medieval fantasy. A tall man in a dark robe sat on a high stool at a break in the wagon circle. "Come one, come all to the Dark Carnival. See wonders beyond imaginings." The words were standard, tired, and trite, but his voice and cadence imbued them with mystery and pull. I found my feet walking toward him, almost without conscious thought. "Good evening fair maiden. Do you seek entry to the carnival?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Two coins please."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I reached into a pocket, then another, until I found a nickel and a penny. Red with embarrassment, I dropped the coins into his hand, without looking up. He laughed softly, "It matters not what the coins are, only that there are two. Many cannot accept entry without feeling as if they had paid for the privilege. Enter, and be welcome."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A strange peace washed over me as I stepped between the wagons. The music seemed to grow louder and the fires warmer once I was within the circle. Sawdust had been spread over the pavement, damping the sound and making the surface more pleasant to walk and stand on. I wandered between the small booths, the attraction tents, and the circling performers. There were jugglers, fire spinners and eaters, games of chance, dancers and acrobats, tents with bizarre attractions from the deformed to the erotic. What struck me the most as I wandered the grounds was the lack of other visitors. There were plenty of silent, white face painted performers, hawkers, and attractions, but only a handful of others like myself. Unlike the carnivals I had seen as a child, once I was inside the circle of wagons, there was no additional charge for the attraction tents or even at the food vendors.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hours passed all too quickly and soon the shadows started to lighten with approaching day. My heart grew heavy at the thought of having to walk out of the circle. On impulse I stopped a passing woman, her face painted in white with a single red rose, drawn in exquisite detail, on her left cheek. "I, who can, please," I couldn't get the words to form.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The tall man from the entrance stepped up from behind me. "Do you wish to travel with us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, I think I...yes, yes I do," the conviction welled up from deep within, stronger, more powerful than I would have believed possible.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You must ask Yara, the mistress of the carnival. If she wills it, it will be so. Her vardo, her wagon, is the one to your right with the most fancy embellishments."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I, I ..." fear clutched at me. What could I say to this Yara that would convince her? "I don't think I can..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nonsense, fair maiden. Many have traveled with us. Now go and ask if you truly desire."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I stood paralyzed with fear before turning away from the wagon, towards the gap back to the rest of the world. Fear drove me toward it in a fast walk, which slowed the closer I got. A flash of desire drove me to run back to the ornate wagon and slide to a halt, looking up at the door. The wagon was carved in intricate designs of leaping cats, snarling wolves, and fantastic animals unseen outside of fantasy graphic novels. Deep colors formed patterns behind the creatures and highlighted the windows and door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Perched on a stool, on the small porch at the back of the wagon, was an old woman. Her lined face was shaded by a wild tangle of grey hair. She leaned back against the door frame and puffed slowly on a long pipe. The smoke was acrid and harsh, not tobacco, but something else. An strange inner fire danced in her intense green eyes as she watched the carnival members taking down tents and gathering their things. She was dressed in layered, patterned skirts, faded a bit from long years of wear, but still dazzling in their patterns and color and a simple green silk blouse under a ruby red velvet vest. Her gaze swiveled to me as I drew up at the base of the steps.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She waited for me to speak. When I was unable to she eventually said, "It is permissible to ask for what you desire. How else will anyone know, if you do not tell them?" Her voice was strong, slightly deep, with just a faint roughness from years of smoking and possibly drinking.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...I don't want, I ... please, let me come with you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her eyes raked up and down me, until I longed to run from her examination. "We barely made gate here. It is likely we will not visit this city again. You would be leaving everything you know, everyone you care about. You have until the vardos..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I...I want to come with you," I said hesitantly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You understand there may be no return?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to come with you," I said, with less hesitation.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you certain? Travelling with us will change you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I want to come with you!" I replied with absolute conviction.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Welcome to the Dark Carnival. There is one last thing you must accept. You must take the Kis Prelaten, the oath of the carnival. You must agree to help any carni who asks for your help. You must agree to ask for help when you require it. And you must agree to never speak of carnival secrets to any outside the carnival. Do you accept this oath and agree to be bound by it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I accept and agree."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ride with me as we leave. There is more I must explain about the carnival," she said as she offered a hand up to the wagon. Inside it was sparse, clean, and precisely organized. A small bed spanned the front, with drawers underneath, and a brightly patterned quilt spread over the top. There was a tiny table, shelves with a few bottles of various herbs and spices, a large chest with an ornately carved dragon head and inset with precious stones and inlay. A tiny black pot bellied stove was tucked close to the right wall and an ornate woven rug covered the center of the floor. "Tea?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, sure." She took two battered mugs from hooks above the fire, used a towel to pick up a cast iron water pot from its wire cage on the stove, and poured thick, oily black sludge into the mugs. Three large spoons of dark brown coarse sugar went in, and after a quick stir, she handed one to me. I took a cautious sip and found it infused with traces of orange, spices, and not the bitter sugar water I expected.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She motioned me forward, out a small hatch above the bed, and onto the driving seat at the front of the wagon, vardo, as they called it. We sat in silence and sipped the strong tea as the carnival was packed up around us. Handlers were hitching large horses to each vardo once it was packed and closed up. People were climbing into their places in the vardos and pulling them into a long line behind us. Once the line was complete the tall man from the gate approached the front of our vardo as a handler attached the horses. The air around them shimmered slightly, as though slightly torn or distorted. "All ready, caravan master?" my companion asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, carnival mistress."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let's shake the dust from our feet then. Take us a few hours out of the world and then we will camp. Everyone should have time to rest from the long night." She leaned back and began chanting a litany to herself, almost too quiet to hear. In front of our vardo the air began to shimmer, like heat haze on a summer day. It thickened and ran like warm syrup, then coagulated into a thick greyish fog. The fog shifted in hue to bilious yellow, then pink, and finally a faint green. With a quick twitch of the reigns we rolled forward into the mist.</p>
