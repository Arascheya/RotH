<p class="pagecaption">Fragmentation</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I had always been able to feel when the carnival rolled through a portal into a realm, however, this time excruciating pain erupted throughout my body. Sweat poured off me as I lay locked rigid in spasms on the bed. After an eternity, it ended, the pain draining away like water in a basin. I tried to move when I heard a knock on my door, but is was too heavy, pressed down into the matress by my own weight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Karetha opened the door and slipped in. She took one look at me plastered to the bed and hurried out. A few minutes later she returned with Yara. "Karetha, get Andre and have him bring one of the void mare stabilizers and his repair kit." Karetha bowed and scrambled away. "Alex, you will be ok. Your connection to the void has disrupted you when you leave it. Like the horses, you need something to balance that out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Andre, the tall man who worked the carnival gate, arrived quickly with a gem studded leather harness. I had seen them on the horses, but had thought they were only decorative. "Andre, we need something to hold the stabilizer against Alex's skin."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Andre leaned over and looked for a minute, then started cutting on the harness. After cutting, stitching, and adjusting for a few minutes he held up a leather strap with a large amethyst set in the center. It closed at the back with a buckle and smaller gems studding it. "Try this," he said, reaching around and fastening it behind my neck, almost too tight. When I made a small choking sound, he replied, "The gem has to remain in contact with your skin for this to work." Warmth spread out from the center gem, where it fit through the strap and rested against my throat. My strength returned as the warmth spread throughout my body.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Should everything look a bit fuzzy, like I'm seeing through a thin fog?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Andre shrugged as Yara replied, "Could be. I've not been able to ask the void mares what they see. Try to get up now." I stood and swayed a bit, still feeling gravity pulling me down. Moving felt like trying to walk through waist deep water.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Karetha helped me down the ladder and walked with me toward the big tent. "Time to rig for the show, boss. Think you can do it or will you check me after I finish?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is your last show, isn't it?" She nodded. "Guess I better see if I can manage by myself. Stay close in case I can't." Rigging took a lot longer than normal, but I did manage to do everything without help. When I was done, I collapsed in the center of the ring, lying back and staring up at the top of the tent.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The twins came in to survey the setup, saw me on the ground, and came over. "You doing ok? We heard you were effected by leaving the void," Karyne asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mostly ok. Moving takes more work, like I'm moving through syrup instead of air." I levered myself up, accepting Tori's hand and letting her help pull me up. "Ready to inspect the setup?" They nodded and carefully checked everything. I had found it irritating when I had first started, but Now understood it was their way of feeling safe.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Perfect as always," Tori said when they were done. "You haven't missed anything since your first few times."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* they will create a better pendant once they know the void horse stabilizer works on Alex */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* consider - when does Alex find out Yara and the Gazelle are the same person? When does Irena come to visit Yara? */</p>
