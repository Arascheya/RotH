<p class="pagecaption">Split</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consciousness returned slowly. My hands were healed, only a faint tracery of greenish white scars showed where the flesh had split and burned. I was completely naked with a light dusting of ash coating my skin. Only my boots had survived.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The void was alive around me, shaded in nuances of color and vibrancy I had only guessed at. I could see the line the carnival was following, but I could also see radiating paths, hints, and thick strands of fog that had been invisible before. When I had etered the void, I had thought it was a flat plane with fog drifting over it. Now I knew it was a vast fog where I could percieve surface in the direction I wanted to go, or a fog I could float through. I spun and drifted, danced and dove through it, soaking in sensations I had never known of light, shadow, warm, cool, and a weightless freedom.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Fatigue closed in quickly, reminding me of the effort it had taken to sever the tracking link. I slipped into my boots and headed back to the carnival. Slipping from shadow to shadow, I crept back to my vardo. Shaking with fatigue, I was lowering myself to the bed when I caught a glimpse in my tiny mirror. All my hair had turned the same green hilighted black as the manes of the void horses. It drifted slowly in the eddy currents of the void. My skin was clear of all the little brown blemishes that had been with me from birth, but had acquired a faint greenish luminescence. My eyes had turned completely green, glowing with a faint inner light, but without iris or pupil.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I sat on the edge of the bed for a few minutes, gathering my thoughts, then rose and went looking for Yara. She and Mishana were sitting on the steps of her vardo, arguing about what to do with the link.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Mistress," I started. My voice was the same, a low, generic soprano.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Alex," Yara replied as they both looked to me.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You've changed," Mishana said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The link is broken," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It is? How did you manage that?" Mishana asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I disipated it into the void. I'm not sure how to explain it better than that."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I like the new look. Similar to the original, but more exotic, Is that a result of your effort?" Yara asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you for doing that. Are you ok? Did you sever their guiding link too, or just the tracking one?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Just the tracking one, mistress. I wouldn't feel right destroying those that were ordered to accompany the noble. I am not certain if I am alright. I am very tired, but otherwise, I think I am still myself."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You have shown great maturity and mercy, Alex. Remember that as you continue to learn of yourself. Do you wish to return to silence, or keep your voice? You have earned the right to choose."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I have little need of speech. I would like to be silent for now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Done."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I returned to my vardo and fell into a deep and peaceful sleep. The carnival was going to another realm in the morning and we would need to be ready for performances and work.</p>
