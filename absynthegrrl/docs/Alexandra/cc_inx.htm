<p class="regtxt5">My name is Alexandra, Alex to those who know me, and I am the Recorder for the <a href="../../gm_resources/info/carnival.htm">Dark Carnival</a>. How I became the Redorder is a <a href="alex_0001.htm">story</a> for another time. This is a series of conversations around the campfire at the <a href="../../gm_resources/info/carnival.htm">Dark Carnival</a> Winter Quarters. The Winter Quarters are located in a heavily wooded, mountainous region of the <a href="../../gm_resources/places/planescape/plains.htm">Sphere of Concordant Discord, The Discord</a>, as it is commonly called. <a href="../../gm_resources/places/planescape/plains.htm">The Discord</a> is a hollow sphere,with regions located on its inner surface. Floating in the center of <a href="../../gm_resources/places/planescape/plains.htm">The Discord</a> is <a href="../../gm_resources/places/planescape/centrys.htm">Sphere</a>, the city at the center of the multi-verse. The outer surface of <a href="../../gm_resources/places/planescape/plains.htm">The Discord</a> connects to various Realms and places throughout the multi-verse.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Before we get to the list of the recorded conversations, I should say something about the participants.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Three of the participants are the <a href="../../gm_resources/info/3sisters.htm">Three Sisters</a>, the only true gods in the multi-verse. The Sisters are:</p>

<p class="regtxt9"><a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/she.htm">Stability</a>, she is the face of created things and order. She is believed to reside in <a href="../../gm_resources/places/planescape/centrys.htm">Sphere</a></p>

<p class="regtxt9">Possibility, she is the face of the darkness and the potential held in unrealized things.</p>

<p class="regtxt9"><a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/irena_k.htm">Balance</a>, she is the face of Balance between the various polarities of the multi-verse. If any polarity gains too much power, they could end the multi-verse. <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/irena_k.htm">Balance</a>,or the <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/irena_k.htm">Keeper of Balance</a>, or <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/irena_k.htm">The Keeper</a>, keeps watch and moves to prevent this.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Another common participant is <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/ishra.htm">Ishra</a>, Demon Queen of Spiders. <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/ishra.htm">Ishra</a> began as a godling, but through a series of unintended events has risen to near-godess status. <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/ishra.htm">Ishra</a> is a very close and true friend of <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/irena_k.htm">The Keeper</a>.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/kayara.htm">Old Yara</a>, the Mistress of the <a href="../../gm_resources/info/carnival.htm">Dark Carnival</a>,is also a common participant. She suggested that I record the conversations and the others did not disagree.</p>
