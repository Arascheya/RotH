<p class="pagecaption">The Beginning</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The air was thick with water, hot from the day, and filled with the sounds and scents of the swamp in evening. Shareya and her grandmother, Tamistra, had just returned to the hovel after gathering herbs that needed darkness to reveal themselves. Grandmother was at the door when they spotted the girl staggering out of the shadows on the other side of the small tributary near their home. She was naked, revealing a figure well on the way to womanhood. As she neared them, they could see her fair skin was covered in dark, clotted mud. Her movements were almost mechanical, driving her forward in jerky motions. She fell as she reached them, the muck revealed, in the light of their lamps, as clotted and drying blood. Her long, thick black hair was clumped and matted with gore and her eyes stared sightlessly forward. Long bladed daggers were clutched in her hands.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Help me get her inside," Tamistra said, reaching for the still form. They half dragged and half carried her in and placed her on the worn blamket of the sleeping mat. It took a long time to clean the blood off and expose the miriad of small cuts and bruises underneath. None were life threatening in themselves, but the number made them dangerous.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They worked late into the night cleaning, annointing, and bandaging until the girl was almost mummified in bandages. Then they collapsed in sleep on an improvised pallet near the girl.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next day dawned dark and grey, with a heavy wind blowing in from the sea. Rain drummed on the ground outside and the leaky spot in the thatch dripped into the basin left to catch it. The girl drifted awake, long enough that Shareya could get some broth down her, then she drifted back to sleep. They watched her through the day, fearing the fever that could so easily settle into the wounds, but they remained in good condition.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The girl woke at dusk, when her bandages were being changed. Fear clouded her eyes until she took in the tiny hut, the warm candles, and the two women watching over her. "Where am I?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In the Shalarn Bayou."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you the witch of the mists?" the girl asked Tamistra.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The witch of the mists? Where did you hear that nonsense? I'm just a simple herbalist, living where the church won't interfere with me. Do you have a name, child?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ghunayyasara, mistress."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You are of the Ocean Wanderers, then? What are you doing in the swamps?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You know herbs? Can you get it out of me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What, child?" Tamistra watched as Ghunayyasara pointed at her belly. "You're pregnant?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Get it out of me," she said in an emotionless voice. "They put it in there and I don't want it. I'll not let a vermin's parasite live in me." She smiled a wicked, cruel smile. "None shall tell the tale. This thing in me is the last of them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you sure? No 'cure' is really safe and it could prevent you from having children when you want them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Either give me the herbs or give me my daggers and I'll cut it out of me." She struggled to rise, but fell back from exhaustion.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can't give you anything until you are stronger. How long have you known?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"My last cycle should have been three weeks ago."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, it's early enough that you will have time to get stronger before taking them. Do you want to talk about why you are here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They came on us after a storm. Our sails were in rags and we were leaking below the water line. We tried to fight, but we were exhausted and battered from fighting with the storm. They took the children, fifteen and younger, for slaves, killed the adults, and fired our ship. The boys were sold but the girls were kept to service the crew. The others died from injuries, abuse, or despair. I found my chance and killed them all. I couldn't go ashore in the port, there were others of their kind everywhere, so I took a small boat and headed up the river. Many know of the witch of the mists and the way she helps us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You ran afoul of the East Oceanic Trade Company?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They hate us and attack us whenever they can."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Tamistra gasped in surprise and paused as she cut away the ill-fitting shirt the girl was wearing. A strange silver amulet rested against her bony chest.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What is it?" Shareya asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Dark ship, restless spirits, mists and darkness. No, not her, not her!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nana, what is it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Keep working. We must keep this girl alive."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What was it, Nana? What did you see?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not to be discussed in the dark of the night."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In the morning Shareya, when there is light and life."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They worked late into the night cleaning, annointing, and bandaging until the girl was almost mummified in bandages. They took the bloody rags that had been her clothes and burned them, then went in and lay down to sleep. Both of the tossed and turned as vague dark dreams disturbed the last of the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next day dawned dark and grey, with a heavy wind blowing in from the sea. Rain drummed on the ground outside and the leaky spot in the thatch dripped into the basin left to catch it. The girl drifted awake, long enough that Shareya could get some broth down her, then she drifted back to sleep. They watched her through the day, fearing the fever that could so easily settle into the wounds, but they remained in good condition.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Several times Shareya tried to get Tamistra to tell her about what she say in the night, but she shook her head and pointed at the storm, "Too dark and cold for such thoughts."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The girl woke at dusk, when her bandages were being changed. </p>
