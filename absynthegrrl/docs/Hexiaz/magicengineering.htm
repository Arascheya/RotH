<p class="pagecaption">How Magic Works</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some scratch notes —</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One great use of magic is in the fabrication of extremely useful materials. It began in probably in pre-historical times, when spinning, weaving, woodworking, clay working, and especially metalsmithing all stood in grave need of improvement.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Metalworking</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The most significant contribution magic made was with the development of fire-magic and, more generically, heat-magic. In the beginning, fire seemed one of the aptest vessels for mystical significance, and so it proved [NOTE: the anthropological/historical/magical term for this kind of thing is "projective discovery", and it explains rather a lot.] The furnaces of magicians were always hotter, and eventually their refinements of understanding and craft provided a conceptual transition from fire to the more physically fundamental heat, in small, controllable environments, called foundries, unattainable by non-magical civilizations.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This development of intense, concentrated sources of heat (although never all that widespread — only the wealthy could secure the services of magicians to, for example, heat their homes) that didn't require large coordinated efforts to construct made, of course, a huge differrence in metallurgical capability. [To contrast this with our primary world: a Bessemer blast furnace is huge, expensive, labor-intensive to build and operate, and requires significant fuel infrastructure including mining, transport, coking establishments etc. (Not only that, Bessemers required some fairly sophisticated design physics.) Our world didn't see the things until the 19th century. Magically assisted metallurgy brought similar capabilities for producing dependably high-quality steel stock (although in smaller quantity) to Torestrien civilizations much earlier — in some, roughly the equivalent of high middle-age development.] The availability of excellent steel, iron and bronze stoked the need for more and better.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Ceramics The availability of extremely high heat furnaces was of course a boon to ceramics. In the beginning, it remained a comparatively weak driver for discovery of magical technologies.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Materials science</p>

<p class="regtxt5">While metalworkers concentrated mainly on sourcing and application of heat, the ropemakers, spinners and weavers were of course interested other aspects of crafting magic. These aspects were all pertinent to the utility of their various products. Setting aside early interest in such things as very warm and waterproof garments, the two things all of these fields of endeavor focused on were:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">
    <ul class="regtxt5">
        <li>tensile strength of fibers</li>
        <li>topology of fibers (applied)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Magics to untangle masses of fibers, and make them straight, combined with "macrame magics" that wove, twisted, plaited, and knotted fibers, boosted fiber technologies along substantally. And the quest for tensile strength led to some of the earliest developments in formalized materials science.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The categories of materials science fall into these general areas:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">
    <ul class="regtxt5">
        <li>metallurgy</li>
        <li>crystals</li>
        <li>fibers</li>
        <li>laminates</li>
        <li>plasmics</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Torestrien (and later, System) civilization knows only rudimentary chemistry; has no really developed atomic theory, and (except for crystals) doesn't have a lot of understanding of molecular properties; understands electricity and magnetism mainly as characteristics of the universe manipulated by magic. But, when it comes to materials and fabrication, magic has gotten them to an advanced place.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Fibers</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Unable to purposefully create such high-tensile-strength fibers as Kevlar, fiber workers have nonetheless been able to develop some pretty amazing stuff.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">low stretch</p>

<p class="regtxt5">
    <ul class="regtxt5">
        <li>graphite (yeah, that high tensile strength monster.) Unable to produce it in long unbroken chains, they create long knotted cords of shorter lengths of a less slippery kind of graphite. The result: a very strong, non-stretching cord.</li>
        <li>shegfe - a thin (actually crystalline) fiber, very long, single-stranded, unbroken. Something close to the ultimate fiber, although very dangerous in a sinclair-chain way.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Force Manipulation</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One of the most important single engineering uses of magic is the drawing of magical energy from another place (sourced magic) and releasing it as physical energy in the world. There are several structices that can cause this to happen; obvoiusly, they are bound into material artifacts to make practical use of it.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Traction Spars</p>

<p class="regtxt5">(note: in terms of contemporary physics, it would have been better to call this engineering construct a "thrust spar" or perhaps an "impulse spar". But early Torestrien engineers, working from an incorrect theory of magical action, used the term "traction", and that has remained the idiom. fortunately for us, really: calling it a "thrust spar" would invite tedious jokes and discussions of penile/Freudian? symbology. In a story filled with traditionally cigar-shaped airships, well… sometimes a spar is only a spar.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two bound structices, a paired set, of the particular type required, are mounted a fixed distance apart. They are not at all the same: one is called the tractor (T) and one is called the load (L). When activated, they generate a "differential force" F, whose vector is parallel to the displacement vector LT, and whose magnitude is expressed as a function of the magnitude of LT.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Without getting all math on anybody's ass, the function is a bounded sine function. The upper and lower bounds are both fairly classic s-curves, starting at zero, fairly close together for the initial shallow part of the s-curve functions, diverging during the steep portion of the curve, and then converging again as they go for a while quasi-asymptotic to the theoretical maximum energy throughput of the lure-thruster system; and then falling off again, as the tractor and load exceed their best proximity, becoming truly asymptotic to zero.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The wavelength of the sine function, and more significantly for gross design considerations, the useful domain of the bounding curves, are all particular to the specific structices used for the traction engine.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The magnitude of the theoretical maximum throughput is determined by the kind of structices used, and by the size and potency of the actual structices built (which can vary considerably, depending on the size, intricacy, and effectiveness of implementation.) [Crap. I think this is parametric with mass, but I dunno… it *should* drop out, but maybeso not.] Since kinetic energy is proportional to the mass, and the mass of the system being moved by the energy</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The engineering implications are fairly straightforward.</p>
