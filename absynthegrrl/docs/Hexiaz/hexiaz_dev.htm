<p class="regtxt5">Magic, loose in the Solar System</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It's a solar system, but not our familiar one. There are points of similarity, including a very terrestrial planet on which people did in fact originate, but let's be clear: it isn't us.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The planets, from the Sun outward:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">
    <ol type="1" class="regtxt5">
        <li>Sargual, a small airless tidelocked rock, very hot on the dayside, very cold on the darkside. Some mining domes — rare metals supported the effort of establishing twilight band settlements.</li>
        <li>Issfr, another tidelocked world, but bigger and with a substantial (but not breathable) atmosphere. Civilization is still mostly limited to the twilight zone. Issfr's orbit is only slightly outside that of Sargual.</li>
        <li>The Hot Belt, innermost of the System's two asteroid belts.</li>
        <li>Gauz, a watery hot planet whose moon Kuros is so large that the planet is sometimes called "Gauz-Kuros".</li>
        <li>Torestre, the Earthlike planet on which humankind evolved. Two moons, Coin and Bead.</li>
        <li>Hexiaz, a world similar to Torestre in size, with an extremely deep atmosphere and a native ecology. Hexiaz is co-orbital with:</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>The Cold Belt, much larger and colder than the insystem Hot Belt. Includes a lot of ice-rich bodies, and is in fact the primary source of water and other light fluids for outer-system operations. Hexiaz is thought to have been heavily bombarded by elements of the Cold Belt. Some planetologists argue that Hexiaz is merely the largest remaining fragment of the initial planetary breakup that created the Cold Belt.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Yst, a small airless world, with "Airspaces", magically constrained bubbles of air, clinging to its black surface. Some of them are hundreds of miles across. Ystian Airspaces are the largest persistent magical structures known.</li>
        <li>Dompar, a gas giant.</li>
        <li>Reng, a very large gas giant with spectacular rings and its own moonlet belt.</li>
        <li>Erriamm, a smaller gas giant, very far out.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Torestre has a deep and long history, and multiple subtypes of people. And it is fortunate to be situated in a universe in which Magic works. Not only does Magic work, it works in a discoverable, largely predictable fashion. Nonetheless, it's a genuinely magical phenomenon, a close and ultimately mysterious union of the will, and the unconscious poetry of the soul, with the fabric of the physical world.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So, the history of the world Torestre was aided by magic as well as by mundane technologies. And of course, technology itself was considerably inhibited; in many ways, magic makes it easy to skip some of the hard, stubborn inquiries that must go into the development of the material sciences. Those did, of course, come; but the nature of Torestrien civilizations was always modified by the availability of magic. Generally, there was more scope for individual brilliance, and less of a tendency for vast collective political and social aggregations: magic tended to subvert their stability.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">And, when some of the most advanced civilizations on the planet turned to outer space, the odd combination of mature magic and weaker practical engineering yielded simplistic, often quirky, and sometimes elegant spaceship designs. Magic solved, in a fairly straightforward and characteristically very cheap fashion, many of the fundamental problems of space flight. So, rather than the expensive, concentrated, and herculean efforts of nation-states familiar to our own world, Torestrien space exploration evolved as something much more akin to gentlemen adventurers and mercantile coroporations — the familiar pattern of Torestrien society, loosely organized (and often turbulent) collections of small entities, pursuing curiosity, whim, folly, and coldly calculating business advantage, writ large in the huge vastnesses of the inner Solar System.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Over the span of several centuries, System civilization came to be a large, largely self-sustaining thing. In population it never even remotely approached the mother planet; but in wealth, accomplishment, and elan it most formidably matched the best of Torestrien civilizations.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Hexiaz: The Cloud Planet</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The crowning magical-engineering feat of System civilization was probably the great Cloud cities built in the stormy atmosphere of Hexiaz. Hexiaz is an unusual planet. In many respects it's a normal inner-system planet: about the same size as Torestre, with a fleet of small, rather decorative moons and a ghostly Ring of dust and debris.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hexiaz' atmosphere is not, however, at all normal. It's much thicker and larger than a normal terrestrial planet's atmosphere; the density gradient is somewhat less. Planetologists theorize that Hexiaz is slowly losing its atmosphere, because the planetary gravity isn't strong enough to retain it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Astronomers believe that the deep, moisture-rich atmosphere is the outcome of a comparatively slow, low-impact collision between Hexiaz and a lesser body formed mainly of ice, possibly a final act in solar system formation. Certainly Hexiaz is geologically active, and the surface of the planet is hotter than one would expect from any straightforward greenhouse effect.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the meantime, however, Hexiaz remains a world with a deep, stormy atmosphere at Torestrien-equivalent pressure, and a surface that is little known.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Cloud Cities</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Cloud Cities float in this very dense atmosphere. Forces of buoyancy support them; they have large overhead clusters of pontoons, chambers containing helium or hydrogen. Sometimes the pontoons can make for remarkably magnificent architecture: tall cascades of crystal bubbles; great tubular inverted arches; swarms of small interconnected habitats, each with its own pontoons.

<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>

<p class="regtxt5">These were from previous email conversations and probably need to be expanded on as we go.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hexiazi are tied to their planet in some way. Prolonged absense will lead to illness and death. Mechanism needs to be determined, however, is likely linked to the Hexen biomass in the clouds and air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Something is changing on Hexiaz, with the original life forms, that requires the Antigoni to be able to travel off-world. This could be related to what has killed a couple of cities that ventured too deep into the lower clouds. Consider - is this a mutation of Hexen life forms caused by something the cities have beendoing to the environment.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I can't remember too much else, beyond the Antigoni-specific bits related to the flawed (but overpowered) Lens that the Twins got Such A Deal on. I don't remember whether we ever came up with a satisfactory mechanism for how the wormhole/gate phenomenon could be controlled and targeted… something about maybe sending a little automated machine out through a *little* gate, then using the Lens as a viewer through which to communicate with it?…. The little machine could be satisfactorily steampunkish. :-)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Current thoughts were disaster occured two generations before current time. We can adjust this if needed for the story.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The lens has a shadowed past. The twins didn't get details when they bought it nd the supplier didn't know them either.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Not sure in terms of sunlight and other light. I always see the cloud city of bespin as a starting point, with a much cooler architecture. Take a look at a few of the city in the distance images online, search "cloud city of bespin", and let me know if that is a good starting visual.
Moons would be cool, but hadn't given them much thought. Could provide various shades of ilumination at night if there were several. I suspect illumination would be far less than daylight.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I see the cities as having electricity. Based on previous thoughts - docking was under the city, in a framework to support loading systems, transportation, etc.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Poor people live in the under city, that which is shadowed by the rich places above. I don't see society as totally stratified, more like New York, or similar, where the poorer people can go anywhere, just feel out of place if they try to take advantage of goods/services there. They would be more likely to be arrested when bad shit happens in the waelthy areas. The rich would use them as scape-goats in those cases.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Didn't have much thought on Templar appearance - I suspect two divisions - police/guards and religious proclaimers. Police would be in some type of police-like garb.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I do think the main power structure is religious, so this includes customs, trade monitoring, etc. We can split this out if the unified approach is too constrictive</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Consider: <a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/nashta.htm">N'Ashta</a> could have some sort of connection to the Hexen life forms, based on her spirituality. A kind of link that might give her hints of what is going wrong on Hexiaz and also what is behind the "absynthe" disaster.</p>
