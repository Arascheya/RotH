<p class="pagecaption">Magic Enhancer Disaster</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Absynthe" disaster was figured to be a generation or two ago, so the Temple power consolodation is likely complete on cities where it already had significant power, and less complete selsewhere. It was caused by a magic enhancing drug reaction that happened after prolonged use. The drug was derived from Hexian biologicals, however, a balancing factor of other Hexian life was missed. Those on Hexiaz were fine, since they were exposed to both sides of the chemistry. Others only had access to part of it and developed dementia and collapse of mental function, becoming barely functioning automatons, requiring almost constant care.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">System, and Torestrien, civilization outside of Hexiaz caved in badly, because most magic users had availed themselves of the enhancer. The combined numbers of those who had abstained, and the minority who were naturally immune from the dementia, were not enough to support a magical civilization that was highly dependent on the use of magic for its wealth and operation.</p>
