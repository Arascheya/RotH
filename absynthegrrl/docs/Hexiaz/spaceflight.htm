<p class="pagecaption">Magic and Space Flight</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Space travel's still happening, but not very much since the magical disaster. I do specifically remember discussing with you the archaeological/historical speculation that the rapid collapse of the Mycenaean Greek seagoing empire was a case of the trading vessels that knit the empire together gradually becoming more and more predatory - going from trading, to collecting tribute, to raiding and pillaging in order to maintain a revenue stream, and in the process comprehensively destroying the seagoing commercial enterprise for centuries.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I like that tragic arc, and I think the whole System spacefaring model could have done that in a big hurry in response to the absinthe crisis. Add in some good big rousing spaceship battles (destroying a lot of hulls and propulsion spars that would be hard to replace, as well as killing a lot of the magic-users who could operate the ships) and you have a sound logical model for a near-complete collapse of spacefaring capability.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So, what would be left?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Well, there would still be *some* ships left. There would still be *some* magic users unaffected by the primary absinthe catastrophe (by natural resistance or by declining to use absinthe in the first place); and some of those would have survived the aftermath conflicts as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">So, the slow resurgence of System civilization would be happening through three main mechanisms that I can see:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">
    <ul class="regtxt5">
        <li>Remnants of the old fleets, patched up and still running, with whatever crews they can pull together (including slave/conscription raids, seeking especially magic users); with no real rationale for existence other than to keep existing.</li>
        <li>Ships newly built and crewed by whatever entity (Torestrien, or out in the System outworlds) can start building them, as their societies walk the road to recovery of magic capacity; these ships (probably much less grand and powerful than the pre-Catastrophe vessels) would be adapted better to the new constrained circumstances.</li>
        <li>Since Hexiaz is immune from the absinthe problem - what might the Hexiazis be doing in terms of filling in the gaps in space exploration, travel, and commerce?</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="regtxt5"> I *seem* to remember us talking about some characteristic of the Hexiazis' biological/magical "infection" that would make it difficult for them to be away from the Hexene biosphere for extended periods of time; I like that idea because a) it keeps Hexiaz from effortlessly taking over System travel (thus preserving the dramatic possibilities inherent in the mostly-abandoned space travel niche) and it gives the Antigoni, with her ability to move through the Rift, an immense practical advantage - the Antigoni Voyages can be over and done with before the crew starts to feel the ill effects. (Of course, it also puts a time limit on such voyages, which cannot be safely exceeded. Drama there.)</p>
