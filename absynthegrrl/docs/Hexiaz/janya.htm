<p class="pagecaption">J'Anya - captain of the Antigoni</p>
<p class="regtxt5">J'Anya was born on one of the medium prosperity cities. Shortly after she acquired the Antigoni the city followed one of the deeper currents, seeking more wealth. When the city returned to the normal currents it was empty. No trace of any of the citizens was ever found.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">J'Anya's family were "heretics". They believed that magic was a science and had developed as such. Her family had a cache of the old books detailing magical research and thought. As far as J'Anya knows, this cache still remains at the abandonded family home.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">J'Anya is incapable of believing in the religion being pushed by the temples. Between her family upbringing and the devastation wrought on her home city, she has no faith in "god".</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She is hetero, although asexual at this point. She could be interested in the right man, in the right circumstances. Currently, her ship and crew are her primary focus.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a bond of mutual respect that links the first mate and the captain. It has survived their opposing viewpoints on religion and the Temples.</p>
