<p class="pagecaption">Hexiaz Society</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Religion and the Temples</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a single religion that dominates the society. It is, however, much like the Holy Roman church during the middle ages. There are various power factions each based around a strong leader or, in rare cases, a cabal of several like minded people. This creates a situation where each city has a dominant temple hierarchy that is somewhat at odds with the hierarchy in adjacent cities.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In the beginning, before the drug related disaster, there were many different religions based on the origins of the early builders of the cities. After the disaster people gravitated to the religion that provided the most comfort for the massive guilt that was felt. This is the one that became the current dominant one. In the largest cities there are traces of a few of the other religions. However, the only way to know of or find one of these is to know someone that is a member. Since the dominant religion tends to hunt down and convert or remove these heretics, this is extremely difficult.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Temple tends to use 'heresy' as the tool of enforcement. Once branded a heretic a person can be stripped of any titles, position, and possessions at the Temple's whim. Heresy is often motivated by political expedience rather than religious thought or action. A person would be more likely to be branded heretic if they had something the Church wanted. Simply speaking out on religious thought will only bring charges of heresy if the person is speaking strongly against the local power faction and their sanctioned views.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Templars are the enforcement arm of the Church. Appointment to the Templars is also very much politically motivated. It is a great honor for a family to have someone appointed. It brings better social standing and greater opportunity for wealth and power.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There is a central Council of Bishops that sets overall policy and direction for the Church. In theory, each Temple follows these policies. In fact, they are applied more at the discretion and whim of the local power elite. This leads to rather large differences between the Church in each city.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Membership in the Church is an expected part of every person's social interaction. Tithes are also expected, however the minimum tithe is fairly small. For those not interested in climbing the political ladder religious observances and activities are mostly optional. A person would be more likely to get into trouble for skipping appropriate tithing than for missing services.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hexiaz society is strongly patriarchal, with most power concentrated in the hands of men. It is almost unheard of for a woman to command an airship, for example.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Naming Conventions</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Most cities have adopted a naming convention where names are formed of a consonant, apostrophe, second part. Examples: J'Anya, Z'Ethra</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The city of Agtathryl is a noted exception to this rule. They tend to use names without apostrophes. The reasoning is this city was one of the most recently converted to mono-theism.</p>
