<p class="pagecaption">Hexen Ecology</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The surface of Hexiaz is little known. The planet is home to a vigorous ecology, whose life appears to have no common basis with Torestrien biology. [We would say that it's not based on DNA…]</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This native Hexen ecology is apparently a good deal younger than the Torestrien ecology. (Terminology: Hexen refers to the native lifeforms, Hexiazene is a reference to the planet itself (mainly physical and planetological), and Hexiazi means the human culture on Hexiaz, most specifically the Cloud Cities and airshipping. The people are collectively called Hexiazis.) It extends from the planet's surface well up into the atmosphere - in fact, it permeates the heavy, moist atmosphere in a way far beyond anything imaginable for Torestre. There's some support, in fact, for the hypothesis that Hexen life evolved in the atmosphere, and colonized the planet's surface from there.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In any event, the most significant characteristic of the Hexen ecology is that it has discovered some means of binding magical energies into itself. This phenomenon, dubbed biostructics, involves creation of living structices, and binding them to living structures just as structitioners have been doing with inanimate objects for a long time.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It's apparently highly dependent on microstructics, the creation and manipulation of extremely tiny structices. Torestrien structics never got small enough, until germ theory gave them a reason to try; and even then, the best they could do was to manipulate structices that were large enough to clealrly be seen and understood through optical microscopes. Some of the microstructices found in Hexen organisms are too small to see, even with magically-produced lenses. [These folks would be unlikely ever to build an electron microscope…] Structicologists call such structices submicrostructices, and can seldom do much with them, except at the general level of dealing with structices by other rho manipulations (for example, creating a rho field in which the wee beasties could be contained.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Hexen life incorporates all sizes of structices, down to binding submicrostructices into cellular structures [and if anybody says "midichlorians" I'm getting medieval].</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Some of the Hexen airdwellers are entirely free-floating in the atmosphere; but many of them have coalesced into immense "reefs", large ramified colony organisms, interconnected by plantlike structures that are themselves buoyant. The reefs support enormously complex and diverse local ecologies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Hexen biosphere represents both an economic boon and a growing problem for the Hexiazis.</p>
