<p class="pagecaption">How Magic Works</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The most important aspect of magic is mental concentration on the part of a human actor. It's a particularly intense form of concentration; and one for which most people's brains are not well wired. Of those who can concentrate well enough to do the magic, many do not become notable magicians; either thay are interested in other similarly demanding and rewarding mental activities (philosophy, higher math, music, art) or they are otherwise unsuited by reasons of temperament, or an insufficiently retentive memory.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Memory is also important, because magic operations need to be learned, in an extremely detailed fashion.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Magical Energy</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Magical energy is not well understood — in essence, it's a mystery. But it can be divided into two categories: resident magic, in which the energy is structured, finite, and physically present until released or dissipated; and sourced magic, which is drawn from apparently extrauniversal sources [need a generic name for these] by, and channeled through, a resident-magical structure (a "structic", described below.)</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Resident Magic</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Resident magic is available in varying concentrations, permeating the physical universe. Note that magic is not corpuscular in nature (established long ago by structicologists) but rather fieldlike. We therefore speak of the attributes of magic as measurable at any given physical point (as in any electric, magnetic, or gravitational field.) This field is called the rho terrain (use of the term "terrain" is vernacular because of its location-feature-persistent nature.) The study and manipulation of rho energies is called rheatics.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Since resident magic is not evenly distributed to begin with, and it obeys human thought to some extent, the universe of resident magic is a very complicated place. It has gross structure (known "dead zones" in which magical energy is not to be found) and fine structure (there are naturally occurring stria (as in "striations"), which can often be remarkably intricate, and to some extent amenable to the kind of purposeful use as structices).</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The rule of resident structure is that it has location, and, when changing location, propagates subject to quasi-wavelike mechanics. "Quasi" only, however — there are lots of differences.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It's perhaps best to conceptualize the rho field as more like a somewhat rumpled bedspread than a fluid. Run your hand along it, and wrinkles push out and pile up in front of the smoothing hand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Sourced Magic</p>

<p class="regtxt5">interaction of magic with human thought: Magic is responsive to human attention and intent; focused concentration (as well as less predicatable kinds of thoughts, including emotion, spiritual transcendence, and immanence) will manipulate, to a more or less conscious degree, magical energies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The constraints on this manipulation can be divided into internal and external categories, as seen from the point of view of the would-be manipulator.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Internal constraints on the ability of the person doing the manipulating are:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">
    <ul class="regtxt5">
        <li>the person's innate (and little-understood) connection to the mystical energies. Seems to be largely inborn, although there's some evidence that it can be increased or decreased by exposure, training, and/or significant life events.</li>
        <li>the person's ability to sustain unwavering mental concentration over prolonged periods of time.</li>
        <li>the person's ability to form complex, meaningful abstract visualizations (this has more to do with the business of structics than with magic as such, but it is significant here.)</li>
        <li>there are also constraints of temperament: some people, otherwise qualified as to mystical and mental capability, are unable to effectively manipulate the stuff of magic.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="regtxt5">External constraints on the ability of the person doing the manipulating are:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">
    <ul class="regtxt5">
        <li>the physical region's resident magical potential.</li>
        <li>availability/accessibility of sources for sourced magic.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Structics</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Magic is performed by construction of a magical "energy structure"; such structures are generically called structices, coined from structure and practice. [Kori, this is another placeholder like "ab sinthe", intended for probable search-and-replace at a later date. And, leave the space in the drug reference in the prior explanatory sentence undisturbed, until the drug search and replace has actually taken place… I was gonna call it a struct, haha - maybe we should anyway. But the more elaborate form is much easier in search-and-replace.]</p>

<p class="regtxt5">This gives us the following basic terminology:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A structic is physically, spatially present, in that it occupies space and interacts with other objects that occupy space. It is, however, nonmaterial in the sense that it has no appreciable mass; and it is not strictly "energy" in material-physical terms. It can, however, interact with the physical world in ways that are reasonably well understood.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">General Form of Structices</p>

<p class="regtxt5">[Not that we have to get into this… but we can use some of these terms and concepts, as Ron Perlman's character remarks in Alien Resurrection, "just for color".]</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The fundamental atomic component of a structic is the stroke, which is a directional linear element with a beginning point and an uninterrupted continuous track ending in an endpoint. This is similar to the node-arc-node structure of a topological edge-directed graph , but with three important differences:</p>

<p class="regtxt5">
    <ul class="regtxt5">
        <li>in a topological arc, only the endpoints have spatial significance, and arcs are represented as curved, straight, or arbitrarily sinuous for convenience in graphing clarity. The stroke is not similarly free — its shape is fixed in whichever space the structitioner draws it (2-d, 3-d, whatever.) Although the start and endpoints retain their special status, every point along the stroke is a fixed representational entity.</li>
        <li>every point along the stroke has weight more formally, intensity), possibly different from its neighbor points.</li>
        <li>every point along the stroke has color, which is the traditional term for the formal term quality, representing a mixture of non-spatial mystical characteristics.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Note that a stroke cannot, at any point, be disjoint in either color or weight. The differential of the change in either property is, unsurprisingly, referred to in formal structicology as the gradient vector for that quality.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">All of which is to say: structics is a lot more like art than like math, although the formalists have a hefty set of math tools with which to describe structices.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">How Does a Structic Appear?</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Most structices emit some illumination, although there are some that are refractory or translucent without glowing. In general, a structic is a set of two- or three-dimensional strokes that look very much like interlacing brushstrokes painted in midair,or on the surface of an object; or, most interestingly, within an object.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">One interesting point is that there are hardly any invisible structices. It is, in the first place, very difficult to coalesce a sufficient concentration of resident magical energies without having the resulting structure be (at best)translucent. Truly transparent structices are still refractive (because speed of light in a vacuum also varies according to the concentration of magical energy in that vacuum.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Structices can be tiny or very large. They can also vary quite widely in terms of their intricacy, i.e. the number of strokes and the complexity of the individual strokes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Structices vary considerably in their appearance, with respect to color, thickness, and intricacy. In general, effective structices have an aesthetic unity; incoherent structices are little known (although some of them are ugly-looking by most senses of design, it's a unified ugliness.)</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Physical Behavior of Structices</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The magical energies studied in the field of structicology are not entirely physical in nature, but they do have, as discussed above, a physical presence. This presence is spatially coherent, which is to say that it is consistent with physical properties like length and time; it has a definite size and location, and must move around as if it were physical.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It was stated above, in the introductory description of what a structic is, that structices have "no appreciable mass" (emphasis added.) Magical energies do, in fact, have mass (because otherwise they would just fly around at the speed of light, like huge structured photons, no?) The mass is quite small, but it does put structices into the realm of classical Newtonian mechanics (and, out in space, potentially into relativistic mechanics.) (No one has ever studied these things at the very small quantum level, and my guess is that they do not have a particulate fine structure; so quantum interactions are ruled out. Hmm.)(Not that the System Civilization ever got to the point of working out quantum mechanics. Or even relativity, much… it's a quite Newtonian worldview. [Remember how, in our world, late 19th century physics professors were regretfully discouraging students from careers in physics because everything had pretty much already been discovered? A magic-based civilization, in which hardcore theoretical physics is marginalized anyway, is going to be particularly prone to that kind of conceptual roadblock; sopisticated things like Einstein's photoelectric problem are not too likely to be pursued.] Space flight, coupled with precise chronometry, had got them to start investigating the relativistic side of things, but then civilization started falling apart.)</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Structices in a Vacuum</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The traditional understanding of physical behavior of structices was mainly shaped by the interaction of magical energies with material — gaseous, liquid, or solid. This will be addressed below, but first let's consider all of the other physical behavior of structices: how they behave in a vacuum.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"><i>Energy</i></p>

<p class="regtxt5">Structices, as has been stated, tend to emit visible light.</p>
