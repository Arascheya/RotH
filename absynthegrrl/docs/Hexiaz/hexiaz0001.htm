<p class="regtxt5">The twins, Emly and Anta, were nearing the end of the docks. They hoped to find an airship that would hire them to do some simple work and pay them enough to meet their quota for the day. So far they had been turned away from every ship they had come across. They rounded the corner near the last docking cradle and were almost run over by the hurrying woman coming from the docked ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The docks in their city were small, having facilities that could only support small to medium sized cargo airships. They were located in the lower areas of the city, connected together by a series of walkways, cargo conveyors, and support services. This was standard design, to keep the ships from cluttering up the views from the upper reaches and to reduce collisions between ships and city structures.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The woman was tall, with elaborate blonde braids of a style seldom seen since the city of Tazjahdrath had returned from a conveyor that took it lower into the atmosphere with noone left in it. No trace of the citizens had ever been found. They had vanished without any notes, logs, or clues left behind. She had a squarish face, not young, but not old either, and intense blue eyes. She wore the heavy leather jacket favored by airship crews and had been walking quickly toward the dockmaster's offices.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pardon us," Anta started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was our fault," Emly continued.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should have been watching," Anta finished. They kept their eyes downcast in the perfect subservience expected in the city of Agtathryl.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Missus Lady, where might we," Anta began.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"find your captain?" Emly asked. The two were dressed identicaly in worn, baggy coveralls. Their hair was so dredded and dirty that the color could have been anything from dark brown to blonde.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She struggled against the desire to snarl. "I am the captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two pairs of startled eyes jerked up to reveal dirty, hungry faces and shy smiles. "You are? Oh, that is so..." Emliy said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"wonderful! Would you let us..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"fix things on your ship? We would..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"do engineering work..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"for money."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Or food," Anta added after a long pause.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please Missus Captain. She knows the magic," Emly explained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And she knows the technology. We work..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"for cheap. Only enough to..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hush, she doesn't need to know that!" Anta hissed in warning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain thought for long moments. Long enough for the girls to start shuffling from foot to foot, before she replied, "You can take a look. There are some minor things I could use done." Bright smiles greeted her announcement.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She took them aboard and led the way to engineering. She stood in the hatchway and watched as they quickly assessed the equipment. Muttered comments floated between them in the curious way they had. At last one looked up and listed off what the problems were.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"By all means, please fix them." They were quicker and more thorough than her last engineer had been. They also cleaned up after themselves when they were finished.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now Missus Captain..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"if you could please pay us..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we will be on our way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't be in such a hurry. That was only the first test," the captain replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"First test?" they asked in unison.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I wanted to see if you really could fix things before I asked you to look at the ship's lens," she led the way to the engineering area and pointed to the magical lens mounted in its cradle. It was a crystaline lens shaped object about two meters in diameter. Contained in its center was the space distortion that provided a continuous source of the magical energy needed to power the ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about it?" Anta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You tell me. Consider this the second test," the captain replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anta walked closer and inspected it from several angles. At last she turned and said, "The structure is degrading. I'd say this lens has been used hard."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And look at the power interfaces," Emly started.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I see them, twit," Anta said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But you didn't mention the arc scoring at the interface," Emly snapped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was going to..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No you weren't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Was, but did you really look at this?" Anta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's different from what we've seen," Emly said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Where's it from?" they asked, together.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll tell you in a minute. What is your assessment of it?" the captain asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It might last for years," Emly said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Or it might shatter the next time you load it," Anta said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Replace it?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We think you should replace it. The new one should be bigger," Anta announced.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"At least twenty percent more power," Emly added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The arc-burns are from trying to pull too much."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Any lens that size would be at risk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you have so many power connections?" Anta asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5">"One moment. Whom do you work for?" They looked guiltily between each other, but didn't respond. "You can tell me. I might want to hire you if the price is right." Two brilliant smiles greeted her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, don't worry about that..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why not?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The smiles dimmed. They looked at each other before one answered, "We work for a beggar chief. He sends us out and feeds us if we bring back money. Otherwise he shuts us in a dark room until the next day when we must try again." The other stood eyes searching the deck, refusing to meet the captain's look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, look, I can't pay you much. It would come to maybe the wage of a single journeyman's apprentice in the guild pay tables, but it's yours if you want it. I offer it in exchange for engineering services. This is the standard offer of at will employment. You may quit at any port, although prior notice would be appreciated. I can terminate your employment at will as well. Your duties will be the maintenance and upkeep of the magical and technological systems on this ship. Room and board come standard with this agreement. I have a small crew. It will be myself, the two of you, and my first mate."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow,..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Standard contract..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you think?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think we take it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about the boss?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"To the hells with him. If he doesn't like it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"he can go to the authorities!" They both laughed, then answered as one, "We'd love to Missus Captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And one other thing. It's not Missus Captain. It's just captain. I will not be bound to a husband."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When do we.."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"start? M... uh...Captain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Immediately. I will be here for a day, maybe two, arranging cargo. We leave once it is loaded. Get your things and be ready. You can move into your bunk space as soon as you wish." She pointed to the small cabin off the engineering space. "I'd offer you better, but there really isn't any."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They darted over, surveyed the space, whistling appreciatively all the while. "It's great."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A real door."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Real beds!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's lovely, M..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain tried to see the cramped space, barely large enough for the bunks, a miniature table, wall lockers, and a chair, with the same eyes as the girls. The hatch still showed the blast marks from the time the drives had blown up on the previous owner. She squinted and tried harder, trying to imagine the spaces they must be used to for this to be a palace. Finally she shook her head and gave up. "Glad you like it, because it's all I can offer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Previously on the Airship</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* on the way to get the new lens */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The twins were headed toward the magic constuction areas to look for a new lens for the ship. As they passed a darker section of alleyway a voice called from the shadows. "Well, well, if it isn't Emly and Anta, my two favorite engineer girls. How are you my little gems? New clothes I see. And you look well-fed. Did you forget about those of us waiting at home?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They froze in shock as a large figure stalked out next to them. Huge hands reached out and grabbed their shoulders and squeezed painfully. "Well, it's no matter. I have found you. Now you can share the wealth the rest of us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We..we.." Emly stammered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We don't need you any more. We are respectable now, working on the Antigoni and all," Anta stated bravely.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Anta..." Emly started in a warning tone.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh my dear girls now don't be so selfish. You need to come home now. You'd never last on a ship anyway. I know your type." He smiled a wicked smile.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Help, rape. Help, someone." Anta screamed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why you..." the man dropped his hand from Emly's shoulder and cocked back a fist. Before he could strike Anta he heard shouts and whistles from up the street. His hand dropped from Anta's shoulder as he hissed, "This isn't over." Then he melted back into the shadows.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A moment later a Templar slid to a halt in front of them. "Are you ok?" They nodded, still shaken. "What happened?" He listened intently while they told him an abreviated story of the encounter. "We've had complaints like this before. I'm sorry to say we have not yet managed to catch this man in the act. Would you like an escort somewhere? This isn't the safest part of the city."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We are crew on the Antigoni. She is berthed in bay 21."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We were on our way to pick up some equipment from the magicians district."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you wouldn't mind taking us there."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That would be great!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He sketched a flourished bow. "Ladies, it would be my pleasure."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* back at the ship with the new one */</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Captain..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we found a great deal..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"on the new lens for the ship. You should see it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"it's really great. More power..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"better performance, and cheaper too."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, ok. When will it be delivered?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's outside now..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we came back with it. Couldn't wait..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"to show you. Come on!" They pulled her along with them, back out to the dock. Pulled up next to the ship was a huge transport device with an enormous focusing lens held in a restraining cradle.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain stopped and stared. "You can't be serious! That has to be enough for a small city. It won't ever fit in the ship. What the fuck were you thinking?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes it will."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"All we have to do..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"is move a few things, ..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"cut through a couple of decks, ..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"and set it into place. You've always..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"been complaining we don't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"have enough power."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now we do. And it was cheaper..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"than the replacement we were looking at."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain's shock was starting to wear off. It was replaced with warning bells. "What do you mean cheaper?" The twins exchanged nervous glances. "Out with it. What aren't you telling me?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It isn't exactly..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That is to say it wasn't quite..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"well, exactly..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Exactly what?" The captain's voice was low and deadly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's a bit..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"well, abnormal. That is..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"it didn't meet the design specs..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"for a floating platform anyway."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Take it back and get one that fits my ship!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, Missus Captain..." The captain's warning bells turned to deadly storm alarms.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we, uh, we can't..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we can't take it back."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It was on close-out."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"On special sale. Isn't it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"beautiful? And so much power. With only..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"a tiny little flaw."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So tiny, it won't be dangerous."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well not really..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we know how to..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"keep it balanced. It won't be a problem."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Really, it won't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Let me see if I understand. You spent good money on a flawed lens that we can't return? A lens that was designed for a small city? With a FLAW?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But it's a tiny..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"little flaw, really. It'll be so good."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We can go anywhere,..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"outrun anything. More power than we need."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And it didn't strike you at all strange that this wonderful, shiny new lens was so affordable?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No..well..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"yes, but only at first."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Once we saw what the flaw was..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we felt like we were cheating him."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's minor..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"just an instability, well a fluctuation really..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"in the engery gathering part."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's easy to control. Not dangerous..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"well, dangerous if you're a moron..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"or don't see the magic right."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No problem for us. And we can..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"easily train the rest..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"of engineering to understand it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, maybe not the new guy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He's a little slow magically. But..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"since he only helps with the non-magic..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"it's no danger."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain's shoulders slumped in defeat. "I guess there's no way out of this. Draw up the plans and we'll add it to the refit." The twins grinned and ran to the ship, planning as they went.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Excuse me, are you the captain of this vessel?" The captain turned to see a small group of Templars standing on the platform.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. How may I help you?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We have a complaint sworn out that your engineering team is smuggling contraband. We would like to take a look through your ship."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her mind spun frantically, this had been a clean trip. There shouldn't be anything for them to find. "I assume you have the correct paperwork?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes captain. We have the warrants here." He pulled out a small stack of papers and handed it to her. She thumbed through it verifying everything was in order.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Very well. Come with me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned and walked toward the ship. At the main hatch she motioned the Templars in. "I'm sorry about this captain. We believe this tip to be completely unfounded, still, we do need to check them all out." She started toward the crew section. Completely unnerved she led the way to the crew ladder up to the quarters and living areas. Once there the squad leader motioned for his men to sit. "How was you trip?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How was my trip?" She mumbled, still in shock.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Captain, I'm going to level with you. We have gotten complaints from this source before. Every time they have been a waste of our effort. I thought we'd sit, have a bit of a chat, and then we'd report back. Although, we could search your ship if that would make you feel better."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, no, we can talk. That's fine."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Unless there's something we would find. In that case, maybe we should search..." He moved as if to stand.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. You wouldn't find anything." She managed to say in a calm voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good. We may be Templars, but we aren't stupid. This port sees a fair share of illicit cargo. As long as it isn't flagrant or part of the slave trade, we aren't that concerned."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The trip was fine. We had favorable weather and a good cargo for a change. As you can see it left enough for some refitting that we've badly needed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That's good to hear. I am aware we aren't the most affluent city to trade with. I'm glad your two women made it back safely. They were involved in a bit of unpleasantness earlier. My unofficial guess is their assailant prompted this report. We believe this person is involved in child slavery, prostitution, and beggar gangs. No one that has been involved will testify however."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do you need them to? I might be able to convince them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I'm not sure it would be enough. Some of the low-lifes here are quite influential. The system, well, it is the system, if you take my meaning."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I fear I do. Some things just aren't easy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That lens outside won't make things any easier either. You do know that will raise questions everywhere you go, right?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Blame my engineers. They got a great deal on something way out of control. If they weren't the best I've found, they'd be looking for a new ship. I can't afford to buy another one and that one is flawed enough that I won't be able to sell it either."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you say they're the best? Seems a little strange to me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, well..." the captain shrugged.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The Templar glanced over at his men. "I think we've sat long enough. Head out and I will be down in a moment. I have a couple more formalities to clear up."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But sir, regulations..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is ok. I don't think the crew of this ship poses a threat. I will be right down." Reluctantly his team stood and left. "Captain, once in a while the barracks needs some items moved. I could get you a waiver for that lens if you would agree to assist from time to time." Her face showed a flicker of surprise and apprehension for the briefest of moments. "No, no, it is never anything illegal, just things we don't want noticed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I might be able to agree. Would this require me to interact with the priesthood?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, it would be myself and one other only. You would be paid from discretionary funds, it would not be easily traced to you if something were to happen to us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5"></p>
<p class="sectioncaption">Current Events</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She stood in the wheelhouse and stared out at the roiling sea of clouds. Her mind was almost as turbulent. This was the run. If everything went well they'd finally have enough cash to fix the ship with enough left over for the bribes necessary to get the better cargos. All they needed to do was get to port in the next day and contact the buyer. Once that was done they could dispose of the small trunk and be shut of the weird stranger that had brought it to them at the last minute.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Better cargoes would mean more contact with the temples and religious order though. She gave an almost inaudible sigh. She knew she should just get over it and deal with them like everyone else. Still she couldn't help but feel dirty every time she did. But she wasn't just herself anymore. There were the ship and her crew to think about as well. If it meant stuffing her feelings a little deeper so they could be better off, she should be able to do it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Footsteps behind her drew her from her thoughts. She recognized them as belonging to the first mate. Before he could think she was contemplating mysteries she spoke, "Eight hours if the storms don't get worse. Twelve at the outside I can only hope..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The divine shall provide." he replied serenely.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She choked back the usual desire to strangle him and commented, "Of course," in a neutral voice. She remembered how many times the 'divine' hadn't provided in the past.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm glad I found you I wanted to discuss..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't have time..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Engineering is having some trouble." He continued as if she hadn't spoken.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, sorry." She turned from the window, heart hammering, "What sort of troubles?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing that should delay us. Just more noises than usual from the main drives. They're talking additional parts, over the list they presented yesterday."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How many?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It doesn't sound like enough to hurt us too bad. Probably ten percent over the last requests."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her heart slowed slightly. "I think we can manage for once."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Good, I'll let them know. You know, up here in all this beauty..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please don't. You know I won't listen."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'll keep trying though. It's my mission." She turned back to the view, listening as his footsteps moved away. 'Great, more costs.' Her mind ran over the figures again. There should still be enough, even with the latest. Her previous good mood was gone however. If the drives were making noise then something could still go wrong and stop them again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She heard light footsteps on the deck and turned as her junior officer arrived to take the watch. She forced a smile for the young woman and reported current ship status. "Thank you captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her smile turned genuine as the eager young woman took up station near steering. "See you later then. Call me if the weather deteriorates. With good luck it won't for a change." She walked slowly toward her cabin and her bunk. Some of the dark fears faded as she considered again what a find her junior officer had been. She was the youngest of the four girls in her family, which made her a marriage burden. No one had said much of anything when she had asked to join with the ship. The girl had been so eager to sign on that she hadn't seen the look of relief on her father's face.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">A tapping knock interrupted her preparations for sleep. Opening the door she was faced with the twins. "Heya captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hiya, captain, we just wanted to thank you..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In advance..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"For the chance to make proper repairs..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"For a change."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Although it's all her fault for not keeping that pseudo-science technology in proper order."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No it's not. It's your stupid structics. You never get them properly anchored and they torque the welds on the mounting points."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Well, if you learned a real science, like magic, you could fix those welds properly."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If you just did your job better..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"All right you two, stop it." The captain tried. "Must you constantly argue?" She cringed as she realized she'd walked right into the trap.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We wouldn't argue if she just did her job!" They both responded at once.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm off watch and I haven't slept. You can thank me in a few hours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, sorry captain..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we'll talk to you more..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Later." She watched them walk down the companionway toward engineering. They were the best engineering team she'd ever seen, yet they argued constantly. However, let anyone else challenge one of them, or insult the ship, and they would attack as a fighting pair until the enemy was an emotional blood pool on the deck.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They had been another accidental find. She had been on a run to the edge cities, the poorest of the smaller cities. Her engineer had walked off with a snarled, "Dumb bitch. It's unmanly to work for a woman. I just took your job to get here." It wasn't much of a loss. He had only been able to fix a few of the smaller problems.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned toward the dock master's office. There would be engineer notices posted, or at least references to the local guild. Maybe she could find a replacement that would work for the pittance she could afford.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her thoughts were broken as a pair of thin, ragged girls, shuffled up. Their eyes were downcast in the perfect subservience expected. "Missus Lady, where might we..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"find your captain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She struggled against the desire to snarl. "I am the captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Two pairs of startled eyes jerked up to reveal dirty, hungry faces and shy smiles. "You are? Oh, that is so..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"wonderful! Would you let us..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"fix things on your ship? We would..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"do engineering work..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"for money."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was a long pause before the other one added, "Or food."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Please Missus Captain. She knows the magic."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And she knows the technology. We work..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"for cheap. Only enough to..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hush, she doesn't need to know that!" one of them hissed in warning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain thought for long moments. Long enough for the girls to start shuffling from foot to foot, before she replied, "You can take a look. There are some minor things I could use done." Bright smiles greeted her announcement.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She took them aboard and led the way to engineering. She stood in the hatchway and watched as they quickly assessed the equipment. Muttered comments floated between them in the curious way they had. At last one looked up and listed off what the problems were.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"By all means, please fix them." They were quicker and more thorough than her last engineer had been. They also cleaned up after themselves when they were finished.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now Missus Captain..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"if you could please pay us..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we will be on our way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"One moment. Whom do you work for?" They looked guiltily between each other, but didn't respond. "You can tell me. I might want to hire you if the price is right." Two brilliant smiles greeted her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Oh, don't worry about that..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why not?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The smiles dimmed. They looked at each other before one answered, "We work for a beggar chief. He sends us out and feeds us if we bring back money. Otherwise he shuts us in a dark room until the next day when we must try again." The other stood eyes searching the deck, refusing to meet the captain's look.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, look, I can't pay you much. It would come to maybe the wage of a single journeyman's apprentice in the guild pay tables, but it's yours if you want it. I offer it in exchange for engineering services. This is the standard offer of at will employment. You may quit at any port, although prior notice would be appreciated. I can terminate your employment at will as well. Your duties will be the maintenance and upkeep of the magical and technological systems on this ship. Room and board come standard with this agreement. I have a small crew. It will be myself, the two of you, and my first mate."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wow,..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Standard contract..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What do you think?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I think we take it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about the boss?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"To the hells with him. If he doesn't like it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"he can go to the authorities!" They both laughed, then answered as one, "We'd love to Missus Captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And one other thing. It's not Missus Captain. It's just captain. I will not be bound to a husband."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When do we.."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"start? M... uh...Captain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Immediately. I will be here for a day, maybe two, arranging cargo. We leave once it is loaded. Get your things and be ready. You can move into your bunk space as soon as you wish." She pointed to the small cabin off the engineering space. "I'd offer you better, but there really isn't any."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They darted over, surveyed the space, whistling appreciatively all the while. "It's great."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A real door."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Real beds!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's lovely, M..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"captain."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain tried to see the cramped space, barely large enough for the bunks, a miniature table, wall lockers, and a chair, with the same eyes as the girls. The hatch still showed the blast marks from the time the drives had blown up on the previous owner. She squinted and tried harder, trying to imagine the spaces they must be used to for this to be a palace. Finally she shook her head and gave up. "Glad you like it, because it's all I can offer.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They had been priceless from that day forward, keeping the ship running when any other engineer would have run screaming. Slowly she was able to increase their pay as she had been able to make more runs.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The remeberances helped her to calm her mind enough to grab a few hours sleep before the next meal. Rising almost refreshed she was able to enjoy some of the food the first mate had cooked. As the day wore on her fears clawed their way to the front again. She paced to the wheelhouse and stared into the clouds. The storms had calmed and the bright sun shone on a puffy sea of cotton white. It was one of the rare beautiful days that made running an air ship wonderful.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She turned to her junior officer and almost said they were going to be ok. Then a life time of superstitions closed her mouth. Instead she commented on the beauty outside. She recieved an answering smile in return.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first mate came in and relieved the junior officer. For a time they all remained lost in their own thoughts. The junior officer left shortly after they saw the first flashes of light off the towers of the city in the distance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">As they approached the giant floating city slowly resolved itself. Delicate looking, magically enhanced floatation bubbles refracted the sunlight into a rainbow of color that splashed down on the spires and cubes of the living areas. A thick under section, hidden mostly in the top layers of the lower clouds, housed the support facilities for the populace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first mate silently turned the wheel over to the captain as they approached the city. She skillfully eased the ship closer, losing elevation as she approached. When they reached the right point she slowly moved forwared, into the tangle of docks, warehouses, and other support structures of the port. Their target dock was deep in the tangle of private company facilities. At the marker specified by their contractor she adjusted her lift to slowly rise to the level of the assigned station. Once the ship was positioned she slowly dropped the boyancy until the ship settled into the cradle. She continued to drop boyancy until the ship would remain in the cradle even after the cargo was removed.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Their contact met the captain at the base of the gangway. "Right on time. Most excellent! Let me take a quick look at the cargo and then I'll get the unloaders on it." He followed her into the hold and rapidly scanned the crates. Every so often he would wave a hand scanning device over a crate and consult its information. At last he nodded, smiled, and handed the captain a credit structic. "It's all there, just as we agreed."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you. It's been a pleasure!" She smiled and escorted him back to the gangway. He waved at a forman standing in the doorway of the attached warehouse. The man nodded and motioned inside. A crew of unloaders with equipment filed out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Now we can start planning our future. Tell the rest of the crew it's bar time. We need to cellebrate a little and plan a lot! The first round is on the ship." The mate returned her smile with one of his own as he headed for the crew section. "Clud Kissers Tavern, everyone is to attend. We leave now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They arrived as a laughing, high spirited group. Quickly they commandeered a large booth and the captain ordered a round of expensive Glarvez Fizz, a sparkling fermented glarvez grain beverage, favored when celebrating good fortune. "To us and our future!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They sat and talked, drank, and ate. Every so often a bit of the news from the data feeds around the bar would catch their attention. It wouldn't hold it for long, though. Not until an almost familiar face appeared in the feed. "Today this man was arrested on charges of heresy. He was charged with transporting and attempting to sell heretical materials. All persons connected with him are being sought for questioning. If you have seen associates of this man, or have had dealings with him in any way, please report to the nearest temple offices for questioning. Remember, it is bad karma and a civil offense to aid in the distribution of heresy."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Conversation stopped dead for a brief second before their survival instincts took over. Their forced laughter and conversation would have been believable to anyone other than a trained temple agent. Slowly they drifted away, one at a time, over the next half hour. The captain was the last to leave because she needed to settle the bill on the way out.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Back at the ship she found them all in the galley. They were engaged in sporadic conversation about what to do and what had happened. "He won't last long. They never do under temple questioning," the mate was saying.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Damn it, this time I thought we had made it. I should have been more suspicious, but he paid the right amount and appeared legitimate. It seemed like just what he said, a box of family items from his dead uncle," the captain added. Conversation lapsed again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Maybe we should..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"see what this package..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"is. Before we..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"get in trouble for it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain walked swiftly to the hold, grabbed the wooden box in question, brought it back to the galley, and set it down on the table. It was simple work to pry the lid up. Inside a nest of custom contoured packing was a large leather bound book. The leather was old and cracked. Small brass locks held aged straps in place. Over it a metal webbing had been wrapped and sealed with a complicated magic lock.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The twins looked at the lock. "Wow, that's really cool."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Complicated though. I think I could open it like..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No dumb ass, look there. See the way the metal webbing is folded."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're right smart mouth, an embedded trap," Anta snapped back. Emly ran to engineering, grabbed a pair of small pliars, and held the webbing still while the magical one probed the lock. After a few minutes she said, "This will take some time but I'm sure I can open it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Conversation started up around the captain, however she didn't notice. Her world crashed in on her again. Once more her dream of good cargo and honest patrons vanished in a puff of smoke. The credits in the structic were a princely sum compared to their usual take, but it wouldn't last long. Not after the repairs they needed and under general expenses. Her thoughts turned to the repairs. The mate was right, their contact wouldn't last long. They would have maybe a day before the templars would be down here dragging them in for questioning.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We have it..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">There was no answering twin voice to finish the thought. Her head jerked up to see them staring in wonder at the open book. "Well, are we talking heresy or ultimate heresy? Does it say god is really a turd in the cosmic sewer?" She ignored the hissed breath from her first mate.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No Missus Captain..." The use of the old term told more of their surprise than the slow voice had.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"it's a magic treatise."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"A very old one. Full of academic magic research."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"She understands some of it though!" Emly said proudly.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How is that heresy?" her junior officer asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It's not. It means the temple wants this very badly. They will be even more ruthless now. We have only two choices. Abandon the ship, disappear into the city, and become warf rats. Or, we take the ship and run, returning to shadow cargo and always looking over our shoulders," the captain replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I won't go back to begging Missus Captain," Emly said</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I won't either," said Anta, looking up from the book.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"That leaves the two of you," the captain said. "I won't abandon my ship. I can give you time to leave if you want it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The first mate looked offended, "I can't believe you thought I'd run out on you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't. But I know the temple means a lot to you. You might be able to miss some of this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nievete doesn't become you. Once they trace the book to this ship I'm in as deep as you. I am not leaving."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Better what I know than begging," the junior officer added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So we run. Engineering, what do we have to fix before we go? How long will it take to get what you need and get it in place? We are ok on consumables, however, if we can replace what we've used quickly, we should."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We gave a list..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"to the first. It is..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"enough to keep us going." The twins returned to examining the book. "Oh, and please..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"pick up some fresh items..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"the first has the list. It's..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"our turn to make dinner."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain shrugged and headed toward the dock. The first mate followed behind. It took several hours to order all the desired items and arrange for them to be delivered to the ship.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They were met at the entrance to the docks by temple and civilian police. "Evening Captain," one of them began, looking at the first mate even as the words addressed her. "We were wondering if you might have seen this person," he produced an image of the contact they were supposed to meet, "at any time since your arrival. We expect he will be hanging around the docks to pick up a shipment."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She clamped down on her racing heart. The mate remained stoic as well. "No officer, we haven't."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I didn't think law abiding citizens such as yourselves would have. However, if you see him, be sure to let us know."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We've not been here long. Might I ask what he did?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"He is suspected of trafficking in heretical materials. In specific he is linked to the offering for sale of some extremely sensitive items. We expect to bring in several known heretics later tonight for questioning. He will be one of them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once they were out of sight the mate asked, "How long you think we have?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can't say. It's a fine line. We don't wait long enough and they'll chase us as soon as we leave, certain that we know something. If we wait too long they'll break our contact and have us for sure. My best guess is we wait for the supplies and hope to slip out then." They hurried along as casually as they could.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do we tell the crew?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, they already know we have to run." She strode along in silence for a few moments. "Damn, back to the edge trade." The captain shook her head in disappointment. "As soon as our supplies arrive I want to be out of here. Make up something about a better cargo offer in the next city to get us clear of the docks."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The twins were still in the galley staring at the book. The second was staring moodily into a cup of tea. The captain poured herself a cup and sat down. Soon she had joined the second in staring into her own cup.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We need more books." Emly suddenly said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is amazing..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"it's a book on experimental..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"magic. High powered stuff..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we don't understand much of it yet..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"we need more magic theory books." They bent their heads back to the book in front of them and began muttering to themselves in the curious shortcut language they used.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Do those even exist anymore?" the second asked. "I thought that was mostly legend from the old times."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, there are still some around. Possession will brand you heretic faster than just about anything else though. I never really knew why," the captain explained.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone knows magic flows from god, as a gift to his people. It wasn't to be taken apart and fiddled with. If the people of the first world, Torestre, had respected the god and the magic, the cleansing plague would not have been required."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I love how religion rewrites history. The plague was caused by the refined enhancement drug we sent them. Every colony in the system benefitted from the study of magic as science. It's only recently that this crazed notion of magic as god-given has come into vogue," the captain commented.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If it weren't my mission to bring you from your heathen ways, I'd have to turn you in as a heretic, captain," the first said almost bitterly. "I've warned you before about that kind of talk."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"And you'll notice I save it for when I'm safely on my ship, mostly anyway. I don't want to be hauled away like my uncle was."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Quite the scandal, if I remember. Didn't your uncle refuse to implicate the rest of your family, even though it was known they were teaching heresies to their children?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Why do you always remind me? You know it doesn't help your goals."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know, I just can't help it. They were teaching you such preposterous rubish. Sad part is it could make sense, if it were true."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"If what were true, Missus Captain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The, stories, my parents told me about the way things were before the plague. The plague was caused by human factors in their stories. Some 'god' sitting in the depths of wherever had nothing to do with it." Once again she stopped short of mentioning the precious books, still hidden in the twisting passsages below her parents residence. For years she and her first had the same argument, and on more than one occassion he could have turned her in. He never did, regardless of what she had said in his presence. It took the real anger out of their arguments.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">At least she assumed the books would still be under her parents place. After the city had been found floating and empty, she hadn't gone back. There had been an investigation but nothing conclusive had ever been found. The city had followed one of the downward currents deeper into the clouds, searching for elusive resources. It had been empty when it floated back to the normal levels. There was no sign of raiding or combat and no sign of any of the citizens. A full investigation was launched but nothing was ever found. In time, a few brave families had moved in to try and rebuild, but they never really thrived.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Her thoughts were interrupted by Anta saying, "Stories..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You mean like from..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"...forbidden books and such? Cuz we..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"...know where books can be found." The captain threw a sharp look at her first. He was staring at the twins as if they had grown more heads.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Anta, oblivious to his look, continued, "Course we do. Our city, Agtathryl,..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"...yeah, the one you rescued us at..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Quiet, I'm telling her," Anta interrupted.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You're telling her too slow," Emly shot back.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Our city has booksellers..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They know the old stuff..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"...booksellers that can get them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should go there!" Emly suggested. "Maybe they have magic books..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I'm sure they do bolt fingers. That's why I ..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was thinking of going there anyway," the captain interrupted. "We have friends there. And we know they aren't very friendly to this city." The first started to say something, changed his mind, and remained silent. "Emly, Anta, will you be able to make your repairs while we are in the air?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not as easily, but..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"... better than getting caught."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When will we have the supplies?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"In an hour or two according to the suppliers. Provisions should arrive around the same time. Then we go."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They spent a nervous two hours waiting for the supplies to arrive. They were quickly loaded and then the captain requested detparture clearances. For long moments the dispatcher hesitated, finally coming back with the ok. She didn't relax until they were clear of the city and heading into a thicker cloud bank. It meant a greater chance of storm and heavy weather, but it would make them harder to track.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain had just begun to believe they had gotten away clean when Emly walked up to her. "We've detected trackers in our supplies. There are at least three of them causing strange distortions in the lens. That's how we knew. Anta is devising a way to neutralize them so we can dump them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wait! If we neutralize them and drop them toward the floor, they will know immediately. If they're really serious they could consider desperate measures, triangulate, and take us in the clouds. It would be better to go to a somewhat friendly port and dump them there. That way it looks like we are staying for a while. It gives us more options for misleading them."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Emly turned pale, "Right, I'll tell Anta right away."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The captain grabbed the speaking tube, "First mate to the bridge."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, captain?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Change of plans. The twins have found tracking devices on board. I want us to make a slow change in direction toward Fedsrathian. I don't want our persuers to follow us to a friendly place."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Our course change will seem a bit odd."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Can't be helped. I don't want them to know we have friends at Agtathryl."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok, starting the correction now. Heading to engineering?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes" She found the twins intently studying several distortions in the lens. "Are there more than the three you are seeing there?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't know..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"... Anta's studying the patterns..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"...there might be another mixed in with our repair items."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Emly relayed my concerns didn't she?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes. I have neutralizers..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"But now she will wait..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Until we reach a port."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How much time will you need to get the trackers off the ship?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The two looked at each other and spoke in single words for a few seconds. "An hour should be enough," Anta replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Expecting trouble?" Emly asked.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"The way our luck runs, yes," the captain replied. "How are the repairs going?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"We should be finished in a few more hours."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everything is going well."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They sold us good quality parts."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"For a change."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"This is the first time I've heard of a lens detecting other magic items. Is this common?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, captain..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"it takes a specific kind of matrix, one that isn't put into standard equipment," Anta replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Did you know about this when you found this lens?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No, captain," Emly replied.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Magic books would help understand our lens," Anta added.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">*********************************************</p>

<p class="regtxt5">They changed course in a long, wide turn. After several hours finally pointing to their new destination. Slowly they eased their way into the common docks. "Captain?" the first office spoke from the door to the bridge.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes?" she replied, her stomach lurching at the seriousness of his expression.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was checking the city news as we approached. The local political scene has shifted to a far more orthodox view recently. We have to expect the Temple has gotten messages here ahead of us."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How dangerous do think this will be?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"They've had our contact for thirty-six hours. Most people break between thirty-six and forty-eight hours. We should make this a very quick stop. Maybe order a few simple supplies and get out of here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Agreed. I'll let engineering know. Could you take care of the orders?" the captain replied. He nodded and headed for the door.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She made her way down the narrow passages back to engineering, where the twins were peering into an open crate. "Any luck? Will you be able to get rid of these things in an hour or less?"</p>
