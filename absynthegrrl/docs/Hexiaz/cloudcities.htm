<p class="pagecaption">The Cloud Cities</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Meteorology on Hexiaz is a grand thing. Heavy dense winds, extremes of heat and cold, the immense momentum of catastrophic updrafts and downdrafts; the electrostatic potential of the clouds; and the clouds themselves, immensely tall and layered and lit by sunlight in the day, starlight and moonlight and often lightning at night. And all of it miles deep.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The main economic basis for the Cloud Cities is "harvesting", which is the inhabitants' term for acquiring various sorts of biomass, byproducts, or magical structures from the native ecology. Not only are these products often quite valuable for offworld trade, they form the basis for a high percentage of the goods and raw materials that Cloud Cities use for themselves.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Airspaces</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Different regions in the Hexiazene atmosphere have different characteristics. Beginning with the physical issues of depth, temperature, latitude, terrain characteristics of the floor, and the consequent weather patterns; and proceeding into ecological differentiation, magical environment, then finally into Hexiazi sociopolitical distinctions, different places in the atmosphere are very different from each other. When one of these regions is sufficiently well identifiable in terms of distinctiveness and persistence, it's the habit to refer to it as an airspace.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Note that some airspaces are very hospitable to magic, and others less so, although there are very few areas that are completely magic free.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Riding the Conveyors</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Cloud Cities have no more than moderate control of their location. "Stationkeeping" on the planet is of no real use to anyone; all of the planet's bounty is in the air.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Cloud Cities float in great complex well-established currents of air, traveling vast distances about the planet. These conveyors, as the major currents are called, can take years to complete a cycle of motion. And, although their nature is largely in their thousands-of-kilometers meanderings about the planets, they do tend to establish known patterns of altitude change as well [I'm thinking we should maybe not use the word "altitude" for this atmosphere — "depth" has more of the resonance I'm looking for… that would mean that they'd refer to the planet's surface as the "floor" or the "bottom".]</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Steering the Cloud Cities for economic advantage</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Cloud Cities originally came into existence as entrepots and refineries for the riches of the Hexiazene airspaces. Although offworld trade has been somewhat supplanted by self-sufficient manufacturing, and a brisk inter-city economy, those activities remain foremost in the increasingly complex activity of a Cloud City.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mainly by the use of traction spars, and of buoyancy control, which is rather easier to exert, cities can modify their cyclic destiny at certain points, "jumping" from one conveyor to another. It's a serious decision, involving many factors (including internal and external politics) but mainly driven by economics. A jump to another conveyor is saying, in effect, that the City is staking its prosperity for a time on the richness of the airspaces the new conveyor will pass through, or near.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Every city depends entirely on its Fleet of airships.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">The Airships</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Why airships and not airplanes? Mainly because, given a floating city, runways are not practical. Moreover, the regions around cities tend to be a pilot's nightmare of floating crap. When you don't have the land on which to build your airstrips, a vessel capable of gently docking, rather than roaring in for a landing, starts to look awfully sensible.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Also, airplanes can't do much practical work compared to airships. Scouting, and small cargoes of high value, are about it.(Of course, there's wartime) The immense depth of the atmosphere makes something that can use boyancy more practical and the energy costs are far less since air over wing lift is not needed to maintain altitude.</p>
