<p class="pagecaption">Antigoni</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Antigoni is an airship on the planet Hexiaz. It is the primary vessel of the protagonists in the Hexiaz stories. It is operated by the conventional magic of the world, although, it has a non-standard lens system that will allow modes of travel not normally possible for a ship of its type.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Antigoni requires a minimum crew of eight, although ten is better. The ship has most of its space dedicated to cargo. This leaves the crew facilities pushed in wherever they will fit. Quarters are spartan and small.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The current crew is all female, except for the first mate. This is deliberate on the part of the captain. She was given a chance by someone and uses this to repay that favor.</p>

                Loves the captain. It would take a truly traumatic event between them to destroy this</br>
                Fights with cultural training because he is under a woman captain. Rationaly, he knows this is fine, emotionally, it troubles him when tired, injured, or stressed</br>

                Came from a shipping family working from the spaceport city<br/>
                Had slipped aboard a family ship in disguise and started to learn navigation<br/>
                Had gotten quite good at it when she was discovered and shipped back to her father<br/>
                Had also picked up quite a bit of knowledge about communication, weather expertise, what conveyors go where, what places are dangerous for pirates, which are safer, which cities are the most complicated to deal with, types of vessels at various altitudes, etc.<br/>
                Intensely loyal to the captain because she is a woman and because she gave her an out</br>
                Introverted, and uncomfortable off the ship. Engages with the crew since she trusts them.</br>
                Father would be furious if he finds out she is working on such a disreputable ship as the Antigoni. He would prefer she was married to form an economic alliance with another shipping house<br/>
