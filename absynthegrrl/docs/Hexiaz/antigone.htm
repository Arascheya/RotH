<p class="pagecaption">Antigoni</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Antigoni is an airship on the planet Hexiaz. It is the primary vessel of the protagonists in the Hexiaz stories. It is operated by the conventional magic of the world, although, it has a non-standard lens system that will allow modes of travel not normally possible for a ship of its type.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Antigoni requires a minimum crew of eight, although ten is better. The ship has most of its space dedicated to cargo. This leaves the crew facilities pushed in wherever they will fit. Quarters are spartan and small.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The current crew is all female, except for the first mate. This is deliberate on the part of the captain. She was given a chance by someone and uses this to repay that favor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Antigoni started life as a fast pirate ship in the Deeps. She was captured when she attacked a harvester J'Anya was crew on. She had risen to a high rank under the captain of the harvester and was responsible for the strategy that defeated the pirates. She was given command of the pirate ship on the way back to port.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">In port the ship was refitted as a fast attack ship and used as an escort for the harvester. This strategy let them make lots of money and attract others to form harvesting convoys. The last convoy was betrayed by a newcomer to the group, who fled with most of the haul when severe weather struck. The fast attack ship limped back into port with only J'Anya, M'Ardett, and D'Esarra left alive. When they saw the betrayer in port, they fixed Antigoni just enough to run for another city, Agtathryl. Here they outfitted her as a trader and planned to slip out of sight by avoiding the betrayer and the Deeps.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The Antigoni's original design was for speed and agility. Instead of traction spars, she used magical motors, powered directly from the lens, for speed and elevation changes. In the Upper Air, the lens was barely powerful enough to maintain the altitudes needed for trade. A new lens was procured at Agtathryl. It is the flawed lens the engineering twins found. This lens provides far more power than needed for all the Antigoni's systems.</p>

                Had slipped aboard a family ship in disguise and started to learn navigation<br/>
                Had gotten quite good at it when she was discovered and shipped back to her father<br/>
                Had also picked up quite a bit of knowledge about communication, weather expertise, what conveyors go where, what places are dangerous for pirates, which are safer, which cities are the most complicated to deal with, types of vessels at various altitudes, etc.<br/>
                Intensely loyal to the captain because she is a woman and because she gave her an out</br>
                Introverted, and uncomfortable off the ship. Engages with the crew since she trusts them.</br>
                Father would be furious if he finds out she is working on such a disreputable ship as the Antigoni. He would prefer she was married to form an economic alliance with another shipping house<br/>
