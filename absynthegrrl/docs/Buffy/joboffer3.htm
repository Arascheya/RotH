<p class="sectioncaption">Prologue</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I still remember when B. died. It was just another night after lights out. I was restless and uneasy for no reason I could pin down until the agony hit. First there was terror, then resignation, then shrieking agony as something ripped itself out of me and I fell into blackness. I woke in a bright desert with a ragged woman prancing in front of me. Slowly the apparition stalked closer until it could reach out a calloused claw-like hand to touch my cheek. Sensations cascaded through me. Slayers from now until the dawn of time flashed through my awareness creating a dizzying rush of feelings. Enthralled I leaned into her hand and let it wash over me, flow through me as I melted into her. "Slayer," the word calmed me, seeping like clear water into parched sand. It flowed into the wreckage of myself and quenched the burning fires. For once the screaming burnt thing at my center stopped shrieking and looked up from the shattered wreckage where it huddled.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It was the beginning of my struggle to live. Besides if I died then all those people who thought I was scum would have been right. And as I told B. once in the beginning I couldn't stand to let them win.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I remember when they brought her back too. It was as intense as her death, but so much better. Sure it tore some of the slayerness back out of me but it also gave me one more chance to try and make it right between us. Even if I didn’t take advantage of it for a really long time.</p>
</br>

</br>

<p class="regtxt5">It was another boring day on work detail. My group was mopping the dining hall when the usual arguments broke out. This time though Merinda was more smug than usual. Maybe she thought the new guard wouldn’t notice. I was trying to ignore the usual harassment when I saw her grin and felt the moving air behind me. I tried to spin around but pain blossomed in my shoulder and slowed me while the mop handle slammed into my head.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slid down through blackness until I landed on a patch of sand. Strangest slide into unconsciousness that I’d ever had. Usually it was fade to black and wake up later with the pounding head. Carefully I sat up and looked around. A fire gleamed in the distance and a soft wind whispered through the dark air stirring the sand where I lay. The First One stalked out of the shadows and took my hand. Pain shrieked through me as images flashed rapid fire across my vision of men and guns. A vampire woman turning to dust as a bleached blond man rolled down steps. I was B. running up stairs yelling and flailing until the pain centered itself in my head and right shoulder as I screamed to the silent stars overhead, "Buffy, NO!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My eyes snapped open and white walls and bright lights smashed down on me. "Relax Wilkins, your girlfriend still isn’t here. Just me, although there’s a new doc to check you out before we send you back to your cell. So, what was it this time? Another argument?" Alice Kraznizky asked in her usual bored tone. She flashed a light across my eyes again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I was about to snap back at her when the new guy sauntered up and gave me a quick once over. "Is she concussed?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nah," responded Alice. "She’s got the hardest head of anyone in here." Soon I was back in my cell with the images still pounding in my brain. Tears slid silently down my face as I tried to understand it all. Sleep claimed me at last, dropping me into restless and formless dreams.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The next morning I wrote to B. It went out in the mail the day after and then the waiting began. Maybe she’d even read it before tearing it up.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Hey B,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I don’t know what just happened to you, but I hope you’re ok. It hurt almost as bad as when you died. Angel told me about it, but I felt you leaving when it happened. I really want you to be alright.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I know you said you would beat me to death if I ever tried to apologize. Well, unless you sneak in here, I guess I’m safe. I am apologizing. I’m not asking for your understanding or forgiveness. I want you to know I wanted you to succeed at the apartment. Not for soul boy, but to end the pain. I tried to let go after I fell, but it didn’t work. The slayer part of me wouldn’t let me. I forgave you long ago if you care. I’m sorry I woke up pissed off. I wanted an ending and it didn’t happen. Not your fault even if I did take it out on you.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Given the latest, at least from what soul boy has told me, I guess it was a good thing I didn’t die though. At least the council didn’t get another puppet slayer to control. Maybe a small amount of good came from all this. I have to tell you that they’ve tried to kill me once already. I spent some time in solitary for it. I don’t plan to let them succeed now though. The shrinks here have helped some.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">That and the emails to your mom. I bet she didn’t tell you. Do you know what she said to you about me when I was you? She wondered what drove me to be bad. After I held a knife to her, threatened her, she still thought there was something in me worth saving. Gods I wish she was still here. Her emails are one of the few things that held me together. I, well, I guess you should know, now that she’s gone. Gods B, I’m so sorry. All my life I wished for a mom like yours, and I still had to go and screw it up.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Anyway, I’ll back you any way I can against the council. Just let me know what you need and I’ll do what I can.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Congrats, I guess, on William. He’s hot for a dead guy. Hell, he’s just plain hot! If you can forgive him, maybe there’s a chance for me somewhere in the distant future. Is he ok? I got this really weird tangle of visions last night. It looked like he was hurt as well as you.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I don’t know what’s gonna happen here. The mayor got rid of all the murder stuff so I can’t even pay for what I’ve done. You were right. I wish I could have let you know. I do care. I see them every night and nothing changes. The stake goes down, Allan dies, and nothing I can do stops it.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">They’re turning me loose soon. Don’t worry, I won’t come back. I’ve arranged with soul boy to go into hiding here, maybe do a little on the side for him to survive with. He’ll know how to find me in case you need to warn me about the council or anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I’m sorry for everything and I wish I could go back and try again. There’s so much more I want to say, but this is probably more than enough already. I have never hated you. Envied you, feared you, loved you, been jealous as hell of you, but never hated you.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Faith</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">I guess I was thinking too hard about Buffy when I fell asleep cause it wasn’t more than a few minutes until my eyes opened onto shadows, fire, and the open desert. Wind whipped sparks from the fire, sending them spiraling up to the heavens. Not knowing what to expect I was trying to see beyond the fire when a darker shadow moved over there. Dropping into a ready stance I waited to see what it would do. Slowly it moved into the light and I saw Buffy, looking as confused as I was. She clutched my dagger in her hand. My blood still seemed to cover it. "Hey B., see you still got my knife."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Faith, what are you doing here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don’t know B, thought you called the party."</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">My eyes flew open and I was staring at the ceiling in my cell.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She wouldn’t leave my thoughts the next day. In a daze I walked through a typical day, even more distant than usual. That night and for several additional nights my dreams were their usual chaos of terror and death.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">It wasn’t until a week later that I once again opened my dream eyes onto shadows, fire, and the open desert once again. Wind whipped sparks from the fire, sending them spiraling up to the heavens. Not knowing what to expect I was trying to see beyond the fire when a darker shadow moved over there. Dropping into a ready stance I waited to see what it would do. Slowly it moved into the light and I saw Buffy, looking as confused as I was. She clutched my dagger in her hand. My blood still seemed to cover it. "Hey B., see you still got my knife."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Faith, what are you doing here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don’t know B, thought you called the party." I stared at Buffy for a long time before motioning to the knife. "You would succeed this time. I won’t fight you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Buffy stared at the knife as it morphed into a scroll. Slowly she unrolled it and began reading. Words in a language dead before the Egyptians rolled from her mouth in a somber stream. I felt a tug at my side and the wound she gave my opened up. Blood leaked around my clutching hand. Horrified I stared at her as a similar red stain appeared on her white blouse. Her voice faltered and the words faded off into the distance. As the last of their sound slipped away the blood stopped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Shuddering my eyes flew open in my cell as I sat up abruptly. "Shit, shit, shit." I muttered as I still felt a faint pain radiating from my scar.</p>
</br>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">The days passed bringing my parole even closer, yet I was nervous. Every night I awoke time and again to slamming a stake into Alan’s heart. Every day I still had to dodge Merinda and her bullies.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Just when I thought I was safe from the dream I plunged onto the sand once more. Wind whipped sparks from the fire, sending them spiraling up to the heavens. Not knowing what to expect I was trying to see beyond the fire when a darker shadow moved over there. Dropping into a ready stance I waited to see what it would do. Slowly it moved into the light and I saw Buffy, looking as confused as I was. She clutched my dagger in her hand. My blood still seemed to cover it. "Hey B., see you still got my knife."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Faith, what are you doing here?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don’t know B, thought you called the party." I stared at Buffy for a long time before motioning to the knife. "You would succeed this time. I won’t fight you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Buffy stared at the knife as it morphed into a scroll. Slowly she unrolled it and began reading. Words in a language dead before the Egyptians rolled from her mouth in a somber stream. I felt a tug at my side and the wound she gave my opened up. Blood leaked around my clutching hand. Horrified I stared at her as a similar red stain appeared on her white blouse. Her voice faltered and the words faded off into the distance. As the last of their sound slipped away the blood stopped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Silently the First One stalked to where the fire was. Her hands shot out to touch both of our foreheads. Images cascaded through my head of  Buffy’s first watcher dieing, the Master fighting her and killing her, killing Angel, jumping to save Dawn, being ripped from heaven, the knife plunging into my guts, seeing the blood pooling on Buffy’s hand and the shocked horror that Buffy felt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">With shuddering cry I sank to the desert sands as shock shut down my mind.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I awoke with tears running from my eyes. "We aren’t that different after all are we?" I thought. It wasn’t what I wanted. I wanted her to have had the life I never would have, friends, family, happiness, all the things that would justify my jealousy of her. Now that illusion was denied to me. Suddenly I wished I hadn’t even sent her anything. It would just cause more pain.</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">The next day it was my group’s turn in the kitchen. We were cleaning up after lunch when one of the guards came in. "Wilkins, visitor." I got up and followed her toward the visitor booths thinking Angel must finally be coming back to let me know the latest. As I approached the booth I was thinking of the things I could tell him. So distracted was I that it took a moment to realize who was actually sitting on the other side of the glass. When I did I froze for a moment. "Come on Wilkins, I haven’t got all day," My guard snapped.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Mechanically I moved forward, breathing deeply, trying desperately to reach my center as Tabitha was always saying I should. At last I was seated opposite her and reaching shakily for the handset. "B. Buffy, uh hi..." It sounded lame to me, I had no idea how it sounded to her. Trying desperately to pull up my old ‘tude I tried again, "Hey B. come to beat me down?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She gave a sickly smile of her own and tried to match my comment. "Yeah, I was going to, but someone put this glass in the way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Bummer, maybe later..." I managed with a bit more assurance.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Nah, don’t think I want to any more." She looked away embarrassed for a moment. "I’ve been having dreams..." She trailed off, but I could see in her eyes that they had been haunting her as well.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, me too," my voice trailed off as I looked at her. "Are you ok? I dreamt you were shot..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was. It was some of the council." She looked down for a few minutes before continuing hesitantly, "Uh, I, uh, I got your letter…and read it…I wanted to see you before you, you know, before you disappeared." She stopped again. With a deep breath she continued, "I need your help."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I sat back stunned, "Don’t that just beat all..." I couldn’t keep the surprise and bitterness out of my voice. Then I saw her look and tried desperately to back-pedal, "Uh, sorry, bad response, old habits. I didn’t mean it that way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You did. I would have," then she blushed red and tried to back-pedal as well. "Damn, I promised myself I wouldn’t do this."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It’s ok. You know me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No it’s not ok. I never knew you and I never tried to either. I just expected you would be like me, being a slayer and all. You aren’t me, I’m not you..." she trailed off again. "But we aren’t so different and that scares me. I didn’t want to see what you mirrored back at me. I still don’t like what it makes me see, but I can’t keep hiding. Faith, I need your help, I really do. I need that cynicism and detachment you can get. You’re the only person I can trust besides Spike." I could tell she saw me pull back and stare because suddenly the First One was looking out of her eyes. "You know what we are. You’ve felt it too, haven’t you? Look at me!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The voice echoed and rolled through my mind until the bit of the First I was carrying responded as well. I stared into her eyes and suddenly we were on the sand again. We stalked around each other, circling like two predators sniffing each other out. Suddenly we lunged and slammed together. Again echoes of the past rolled across us. This time the effect was so intense as to be indescribable. I saw Red struggling with magical addiction, Xander standing up a girl, the girl going all vengeance demon, Giles fleeing to London, Travers and his drug experiments, and finally the attempted sacrifice. "What do you need B.?" I was lost. I could deny her nothing and suddenly she knew it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She threw herself back from me and the dream realm collapsed immediately, throwing us back into our bodies. We sat in shocked silence. "I need you to come back with me to Sunnyhell," she finally said.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wanted to even though it would be torment, but I wouldn't be strong enough to not slide back into the dark. I took a really deep breath and replied, "Uh B., it isn’t going to work. I’ll still be jealous of you and definitely of dead boy, er Spike." Her puzzled look forced me to continue softly and with great embarrassment. "B., I don’t love you like a sister. That’s why it hurt so much. Guys are ok for get some and get gone, but women...well women deserve and can give so much more."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don’t understand why you would love me."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Are you crazy? Strength, confidence, goodness, and gorgeous besides, how can anyone help but fall for you? Besides, you're the only one who can almost kick my ass." I dredged up a cocky grin as I finished. It almost felt real for a minute.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can so kick your ass," she replied smiling. Then her smile faded. "Then why?" she asked it so softly the phone barely transmitted it.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I couldn’t look at her as the tears started. It took all my will to force a tiny voice through my throat. "I was so jealous of you. Everything around you reminded me of how much nothing I’ve always had and it made me angry. I ...oh hell, nothing I say will ever justify what I did to you." I couldn’t stop crying.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She looked down for so long I started to get up, ready to motion the guard over. Her head shot up as I moved. "No, stay. Please." She placed her hand on the glass and stared at me. "I understand," she laughed bitterly, "I was jealous of you too. You swept in, took my friends by storm and I didn't know what to do. I shoved you away as hard as I could because everyone seemed to just like you. By the time I realized what I was doing it was too late and I couldn't figure out how to get back. I don't know what will happen. I think I’m straight and I love another dead guy. Gods I don't know why I do that, but I do. But I need you, no bullshit, no lies, need you. The dreams..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Wilkins, five minutes. Better wrap it up." the guard interrupted her.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Try and meet me in the dreaming tonight. I can't tell you in five minutes. Please, let's try one more time." she stared desperately into my eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok B., tonight." I extended my hand to the glass and touched it across from hers.</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">The day crawled along like a death march. Restless energy crackled under my skin forcing me to keep my jaw clamped to not mouth back at any who taunted me. My hands shook as I cleaned and mopped. Finally it was lights out and I lay staring at the ceiling. Now that I wanted to sleep I couldn't. None of the usual things worked and I remained staring at the ceiling for what felt like hours.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I wasn’t sure what I wanted. I really wanted to try again but I didn’t want to get shit on one more time. Trust and I aren’t close companions ever and with B., well the history...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Still I found myself desperately trying to go to sleep just to see her again. When we first met I was obsessed with her. I wanted her and it led me into all the worst places. Now she wanted to start in again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">When my body finally took control I landed once more near the fire. Buffy was waiting, crouched beside it and staring into the flames. Slowly she raised her head and motioned me over. Haltingly she explained what had happened to her. She detailed them all, her experiences with Glory, her death, being yanked out of heaven, hooking up with Spike and the attempted chipping and sacrifice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once she finished she looked over at me and waited. "Wow."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"When you get out will you come back?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I nodded slowly. "I don't know if I can stay after the ritual, but I’ll show."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thanks." she said relieved. "Could I ask one more thing of you? I’d like you and Angel to work it so it's not obvious you are back in Sunnyhell. I know the council's going to try something and maybe we can find out before it happens for once."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"What about the scoobs? You gonna tell them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She hung her head. "Yeah. I can't do another secrecy thing with them. I’ve done too many already. I’m amazed they still trust me at all." We sat staring into the fire lost in our own thoughts until she asked, "Why did you end up with Wilkins anyway?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I can’t stand my real family and it popped out when I confessed. He was evil, sure, but he was also warm and funny and caring in a weird way. It really felt like he loved me and was proud of me. My family was never proud of anything I did. My father was a raving Christian and when he died my mother turned into a drunk until it finally killed her. I wanted to remember a time when things were better for me. Kinda sad really that working for someone trying to become a demon is a happy time in your life." I gave her a lop-sided smile as I finished.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She smiled, "Not really. Seems to fit the whole slayer experience as I’ve seen it anyway." She turned and stared into the fire. For long moments we just sat in the stillness until her energy changed and she leapt to her feet. I looked up into the eyes of the First One instead of her. Her hands flew to her head as she shrieked and then I was looking at Buffy again. Pacing, she turned to me and almost screamed, "Shit, shit, shit! How do you handle this? It’s driving me crazy! I hate this! How are you staying ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"B., what’s happening?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"It’s her, the Daughter of Sineya, the First Slayer, she’s pulling at my thoughts again. I don’t know how much more I can take. Isn’t she in you as well? You seem ok, how can that be?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Gently I reached out and took her hands in mine and waited until the cascade of images slowed. "B., listen to yourself. I am not ok. If I was ok I wouldn't be in here. I’m closer to the first one in 'tude. Want, take, have remember? I’ve always been restless and unsettled, this only adds to it and I know ways to cope. More Tai Chi and more weight training burns it down enough to get by here. I’m not fighting her, maybe that’s how it works, I don’t know. It’s when I get out that I’m scared. I have to try and play by rules I don't believe in. Rules that have always told me I’m bad, evil, worthless... I don't feel human, or demon, or vamp, or anything else, just different and alone. It wasn't until I met you that I thought there might be any other way. We’ll get through this. We’re the Chosen Two remember? We can do anything."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Slowly her eyes focused on mine and she gave me an unsure smile. "Yeah, we can." Her eyes unfocused as she stared up at the stars for a long time. At last they dropped back down and met mine. "You kept me alive when I was shot. I remembered you not wanting to let the bastards win. It was your voice in my head that kept me moving," She stopped again. Her voice was more confident when next she spoke, "We will do this."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">We sat in quiet silence for a long time, lost in the peace of this place out of time. At long last she looked at me and said softly, "I saw it Faith. I am so ashamed of how I was to you." She looked down into the fire and continued so softly I almost didn’t hear her, "I wouldn’t have survived your life."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shh B., it’s over and done." I placed a finger over her lips to silence her. "I never gave you a chance to know. Let’s just get through this. We can figure out how we want to be with each other later." We lay back in the sand holding hands.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The last words she spoke to me were the ones I had prayed for since I last saw her, "I forgive you Faith. Thank you for forgiving me as well." Slowly I felt her fade away as I slowly awoke in my cell.</p>
</br>
</br>

<p class="regtxt5">Two weeks later I was free. I had an address for a parole officer in Sunnydale and I had called B. to let her know I was coming. Angel drove me back and dropped me at the mansion where I stashed the little bit of stuff I had. "Take care of yourself and call me if you need anything, ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sure soul boy," I said hugging him close. "Thanks for everything so far Angel." His look of surprise was worth forcing out his name.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You sure it'll be ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Five by five. I walk over to B.'s, let her know I’m here, and then we get this thing done."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It took maybe five minutes to drop my stuff in the master bedroom and then I was walking toward 1630 Revello Drive. I thought about knocking on the front door, then decided maybe I should slip into B.'s room instead. That way I wouldn't run into Red before B. had told her I was coming.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I got to her window but it was dark. I slid in and padded to the door. Slowly I cracked it open and heard voices echoing up from the front of the house. Moving silently I crept to the top of the stairs and stopped as I heard the argument from below.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Xander was in mid tirade, "...but you didn't kill anybody."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Buffy must have been the target since she answered his comments. "I would have. I intended to kill Faith and would have if she hadn't jumped. How does that make me better than her? The first person Faith killed was an accident. The first person I almost killed was deliberate. Seems maybe she has the higher ground there. I went to her place not only to kill her, but to feed her to a vampire. Pretty evil any way you look at it really."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That's not the same," Xander fired back.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"You're right, it's worse. I was going to kill a human being to save a demon. Sure, a demon with a soul and my boyfriend at the time, but still a demon. What I did to her was wrong, what she did to me was wrong. It has to stop somewhere and she stopped first. I’m ashamed Xand, more ashamed than I ever thought I could be."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Red weighed in but it wasn’t clear exactly whose side she was on, just that she realized what had to be done. "Besides we need her for the ritual. The First One has touched both of them. If Faith isn't included they will both probably die and I don't think we could bring Buffy back this time. Not that I’d bring you back again, not after last time, not with..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I know what you're saying Will. Xander, I know you have bad history with her, but we need to do it this way. Would you prefer I lied to you again and didn't tell you?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Xander sighed heavily as he replied in a defeated voice, "No, not after last time."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Everyone lapsed into silence and I thought about waiting in B.'s room for a better time, then I realized there never would be a good time. Pulling up the bad girl 'tude that served so well I sauntered down the stairs and into the living room. "Hey B., Red, X-man, G-man, dead boy," for a moment I didn't know the other girl in the room, then a sort of wave rolled over me and I knew her, "Hey Dawnster..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"That’s undead boy to you, slayer two." Spike added.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She threw herself at me. "Hey F, never thought I’d see you again." She wrapped me in a big hug while everyone else looked away.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, me either. Been cool?" I caught a look at Xander's face as he watched open mouthed. Then he slammed it shut and glared.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Five by five!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, ok undead boy it is," taking in the closed looks from Red and X-man I stopped uncertainly. Taking a breath I continued, "Uh, guess B. told ya why I’m here. I know some of you aren't glad to see me, so I’ll keep it short. I’m not here to do anything else bad and I’d like to apologize for before. I know that doesn't change anything. I’m here cause B. needs me for this thing she has to do. Once it's done I’m gone again." Dawn looked up with a sad look on her face. "Hey Dawnster, not cuz of you. I’ll let you know where I am ok?" I added softly looking down at her. I was rewarded with a bright Dawn smile. I looked up into the stricken eyes of B. Totally uncertain I mumbled, "I’ll be going now. B., I’m at the mansion if you need me. Let me know when this is going down." Quickly I scrambled for the door, slipping through it and stopping on the porch to draw deep breaths to calm my nerves.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The door opened and closed behind me as I started down the steps. "Wait a sec."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"B.?" I turned back to her.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sit a moment?" She motioned to the steps and I slowly sank onto the top one. "I should explain about Dawn and..." She slowed to a stop then began to tell me about Dawn as the key Glory had been after.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">When she finished I sat in silence for a few minutes going through what she said. "Trippy. That explains the moment I had when I didn't know who she was. Guess I better motor-vate."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">She put her hand on my arm. Startled I looked at her. "I’ve been thinking. I don't want you to leave when this is over."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I leaned back, stared up at the sky, and fought with myself to not snarl at her. "B, we've been through this. It’s not a good idea for me to stay. I don't want to be psycho slayer again and I don't deal well with hurt."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Just think about it, ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I bit back a hard reply and mumbled, "Yeah, ok," without looking at her. "I really should get gone."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Ok. I’ll stop by tomorrow with the latest on the ritual. I’m glad you're here." I decided not to say anything and slowly walked away. Half way down the block I looked back and she was still standing on the porch watching me. Confused I fled back to the mansion and spent the next twenty minutes doing Tai Chi before falling into bed.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Dark dreams chased me in my sleep all night. I gave up just before daybreak feeling more exhausted than when I went to bed. A noise downstairs startled me as I was finishing dressing. Swiftly I crept out to the top of the stairs and listened. "She’ll be here. She’s trash. She’ll come back to get revenge on the Summers girl at the least."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. She’s smart. She’ll be long gone to ground somewhere far from here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I almost laughed at that. Yeah, I was smart, but B. said she needed me and here I was. I crept back down the hall as they climbed the stairs. They turned and headed toward the master bedroom as I slipped into the door beyond. "Remember, check them all. We don't want her to slip away again. I owe that bitch for the last time."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Come on Weatherby, she left us alive last time. If she were the killer they said..."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Shut it Smith. She’s almost as much an abomination as that other one. I can hardly wait for the orders on her." I heard them enter the master bedroom and stop. "I told you Smith. I told you she'd be here."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, yeah, you win. Her stuff's here but where is she?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"We wait for her. If her stuff's here, she'll come back for it at some point. Then she disappears and they think she just took off again. You grab her stuff and take it to the van. Then call Collins and have him send the rest of the team over. I’ll come down and watch the door. When the rest get here we'll sweep the building and then set up a perimeter."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Silently I stalked down behind them and slipped out through the garden. A few minutes walk and I was back at Revello Drive. Red opened the door after I stabbed the bell. "Faith," she said in a neutral voice.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Heya Red. Can I come in?" she stood blocking the door. "The council's hunting me." For a moment I could see the indecision before she slowly stepped aside and motioned me in. "B. here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"In the bathroom. She’ll be down soon." she paused and thawed just a little. "There’s coffee in the kitchen." she followed me down the hall. G-Man looked up from his cup of tea as I walked in then went back to the book he was searching through.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I poured myself a cup and sipped it. "Good coffee Red."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I hate that. Can’t you use people's names? It’s like I’m not important enough to bother with and I really don't like it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Uh, sorry...Willow," I paused while I tried to decide if I could answer her. After a couple of moments I continued, "Look, it’s not disrespect ok? It’s just I really have trouble attaching names to faces and it’s easier for me to just find something I can remember."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Oh," breathy Red was back and it was like a blast of the past. "I’m sorry Faith. I didn’t realize...I’ll try not to get upset with it, ok?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah R...Willow. Five by five. I’ll try and remember to use your names too." We sat in strained silence until B. walked in twenty minutes later.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"B., Buffy, not good news. The council's here and they know I’m here. I just left a couple of their team at the mansion."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Full team Faith?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I’m not sure g-man, Giles." Damn this was going to get old fast. "I heard some names though. There’s a Weatherby, Collins, and Smith, and it sounds like several more as well."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Those three were here the last time," B. interjected softly. "They have a score to settle with us." She added looking at me.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">I smiled at her. "I got that idea. Smith is the one least likely to get nasty. Weatherby wants to kill both of us."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Both of us?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah B. Me for the last time they had you, and you cuz you aren’t compliant enough for them."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Whoa, F., what’s with the fancy wordage?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey, got bored in prison, did the G.E.D. thing to pass the time." It was fun to watch Red start at that. "Hey R...Willow, I didn’t say I was stupid, just that I didn’t like school. Boring!"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Sounds like a couple of teams then. We’ll have to be careful until we know what their instructions are." Giles interrupted, trying to get us back on track.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"The ones waiting at the mansion are there to make me disappear. Then I’m guessing they’ll come for B."</p>
