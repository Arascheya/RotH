<p class="regtxt5">/* concept */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">faith has fairly high disconnects - more so now that she has realized she needs to protect herself. that becoming obsessed by someone else only leads to trouble.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* really need to get a feel for where this is going...:) */</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">Things to consider revising</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* consider: stretch out the dreams - make the reconciliation with Buffy more  central to the plot and gives Buffy more of a reason to contact Faith. */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* plot points: Ascendency Ritual for Slayer(s); Council trying to remove slayers now; Buffy/Faith reconciliation; Buffy, Spike, Faith triangle - need to resolve in some manner */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* buffy - faith */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">do not reconcile them immediately - faith wants to and doesn't want to all at once, same with buffy</p>
<p class="regtxt5">they do need each other, but the damaged trust is going to be really hard for both of them</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">General Ideas</p>
<p class="regtxt5">it doesn't take much to shift a person's focus in development - one or two differences in friends, family, choices can make a large difference.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">pick a couple past nexus points and image how things would have changed if the other path happened</p>
<p class="regtxt5">remember my twitches as i grew up, the fact my first instinct is still to lash out and attack, then ask questions. take a couple of the events where i sought out friends and twist them. rather than have a jr high teacher compliment her on a paper about something obscure, have her ridiculed instead. have there be no teachers she can relate to, none that praise her mind. she excels in athletics, her family does not value that - they berate her for it, like mine did with theatre, only more nasty.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">twist faith's past so it isn't as overtly harsh - sometimes its the subtle stuff that actually does the most damage. every time she starts to get close to someone, take it away from her. at the start by moving on, friends choosing drugs, parents distant and remote. then the death of her first watcher. remember her parents will stomp on her ego whenever she seeks to have one. they believe 'pride' is a sin, even if it is the simple pride in succeeding at something. they will make her feel stupid and weak.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">her original father was a bible slammer and her mother was completely subservient to him. when he died her mother began drinking and whoring around. she was unable to stand up for herself or make good decisions where men were concerned. she brought home physically abusive men routinely and she died shortly after Faith's watcher took her away.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on past */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">in my school you had to carve out a niche early. the easiest way was to be as dangerous as possible, that way the bullies looked elsewhere. your school was weird, even the hard cases seemed soft. i don't think i could've fit in if I'd wanted.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">first knife fight in jr high, it only took two before they started leaving me alone.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">classes - boring.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">have her get GED in prison</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Buffy address - 1630 Revello Drive */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Council</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Travers - seeks to block the ritual at every turn</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Eric is the Watcher that was helping her in London - seeks to help, is researching the Isfahan scroll</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Spike - in love with Buffy, somewhat nervous when he sees Faith and her getting along well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Willow - still shaky from Tara’s death and still hates Faith</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Xander - still freaked by Anya and his abandonment, alternates between wariness and lust after Faith</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Anya - vengeance demon again - get her back together with Xander by the end - remembers a Travers ancestor that was a believer in the partnership of the council with the slayer. Maybe use this to influence him at some point</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Scroll of Isfahan is in Prague located in the Bone Chapel. Spike knows the person who has it once they figure out it really is there. Requires someone like Willow to perform the ritual</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Faith - misses the mayor, honors his memory by taking his name - she knows he had to go down, but feels bad that she was his weakness</p>


<p class="sectioncaption">Insertable Scenes</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* in prison - tai chi class - taught by one of the trustees - Tamera */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tamera - that's all for today. Wilkins, stay a moment.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Faith - halts - Yeah?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tamera - Your body knows this stuff, yet you're stiff and brittle. This isn't head stuff. You've got to let your body do.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tamera - direct look - you don't like yourself.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Faith - I'm a con.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tamera - No, that's not it. There are a lot of people in here who are really bad people, but they are comfortable in their skin. You aren't. That’s why they pick on you. They can sense the brittleness in you.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Faith - Yeah, whatever.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Faith - later in her cell - thinks about what the instructor was saying</p>
<p class="regtxt5">tai chi class next session</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Faith - after class - Can I ask you something? What did you mean about center the other day?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* add? letter? somewhere else? */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">You had it all, loving mother, boyfriend, and friends. Everywhere I went as you I saw love and adoration shining through. Hell, I just did the slay thing and some chick thanked me. It was a weird feeling B, no one ever thanked me for anything. Then there was beefstick. No games during sex, just love and tenderness. It was so fucking weird. And he would have been there in the morning. Nobody I ever chose could do that.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Have you ever hated yourself? Loathed the sight of you so much that you wouldn't even look in a mirror? I have. In case you never guessed, I wasn't trying to beat you to death in the church I was trying to do me.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Then there was your mom. Do you know what she said to you about me? She wondered what drove me to be bad. After I held a knife to her, threatened her, she still thought there was something in me worth saving. Gods I wish she was still here. Her emails are one of the few things that held me together.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* somewhere before the main climax */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">faith - snaps out at someone about something trivial</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Buffy - asks her about it</p>
<p class="regtxt5">faith - it’s rage B., simple rage. Some days I just can't escape it. it’s not right, but I feel like I was done wrong. No one ever was there for me, so why should I bother with someone else? Doesn't seem worth it ya know.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Buffy - faith, we're here for you...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Faith - looks down, away, etc. - yeah B. I know, you are now and it helps, it really does. Just once in a while I kinda forget ya know. Sometimes the old shit is just there too fast to stop.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">/* willow and Buffy */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* near climax - just before the actual ritual */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">B. was going to meet spike and me in the Restfield cemetery for patrol after talking with Eric. In the distance i saw the crypt and sped up slightly wanting to see her again. Just as we cleared the edge of it I heard a voice from my right. "Well, well, it's the rogue one. Out for a stroll?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Turning I saw a dark clothed man pointing a rifle at me from twenty feet away. Spike dropped into a crouch and whirled. "What do you want?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I was told to capture you, but after the beating you gave us last time, I think not."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So the council kills in cold blood now. And you're better than me how?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Everyone has to make sacrifices. Do you think the council hasn't had to kill a slayer before? We should have killed that other one, the abomination, but Travers was too weak to order it."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So you call a green slayer and risk the world for your own power trip? What am I thinking? Of course it wouldn't matter to a pinhead like you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">He laughed, "Trying to goad me little girl? It won't work." Spike was moving toward him but stopped when he said, "Ok William, stop and drop the knife and move away or I shoot this bitch." spike slowly dropped the knife and moved away from it. In the distance I saw B. freeze as he smiled at me. "Thank you. Now she dies and we get a new slayer." My eyes held his as he slowly pulled the trigger. A knife flashed from B.’s hand and the gun went off. I felt a hard thump as the bullet tore into my chest. It all seemed to come from a great distance, my voice hollering "B., no!" in kind of a wet gurgle, as she crashed into the gunman and drove a stake into his heart. Spike leapt toward him at the same time and yelled "No!"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">My knees hit first as the man convulsed. B. stared down at him white and shaking. Spike pulled her into a tight hug as I fell forward. Grass met my face and I couldn't see anymore. I fell into blackness wondering why I didn't feel anything.</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">/* later - hospital */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A continuous beeping woke me first and was followed quickly by a throbbing ache that beat in time with it. The next thing I felt was warmth in my right hand and coolness further up my arm. Slowly I pried my eyes open to see a blonde head resting on my hand and a bleached blonde head resting against my forearm. "B.?" it came out as a faint croak, but it was enough. Her head came up and a moment later so did Spike's. "B.? Are you ok?" she looked at me through puzzled eyes that rapidly teared up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I am now."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Hey pet. You gave us a right scare you did. Bullet near the heart and all."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Explains the pain." I was about to ask more but saw Spike faintly shake his head.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"How do you live with it? He’s in my dreams now." The question came softly out of the blue but I knew what it meant.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"You just kind of do. After a while the shock fades, but you'll see it for a really long time. Will there be trouble?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. When they saw you, the gun, and later got the ballistics they cleared Spike and I."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I reached up slowly and touched her cheek. "Thanks B. I didn't want you to know." 'Gods, why did it hurt so much? Time was I wanted her to know exactly what it felt like.' I wondered as I looked over at Spike, "Thank you too undead boy." He looked almost embarrassed. They reached out and stroked my hair.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Will’s got the scroll now. Spike's friend in Prague found it. She’s trying to get Tara to help her. She doesn't want to get sucked back into the magic again."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, Red’s ok that way. She'll make it I think. She and Blondie were good together. I could see it when I first met her."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">/* ritual - at Buffy's place */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Tara had just begun chanting and Willow was finishing the circle around B. and I when the door burst open. Four men in ski masks rushed in automatic weapons drawn and pointed at us. A fifth man stepped in behind them and said, "The slayers will come with us. The rest of you will remain here for the next hour. If anyone steps out of this building you will be shot."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Spike started forward as a shot rang out. "Bloody hell!" He stopped and stared at the small wooden stake lodged in his arm.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"These shoot wood stakes, effective against the living and the not so living." He smiled as he looked around the room. "Oh yeah, good night witch." His rifle swung to Willow and a shot rang out. Willow stared at the dart embedded in her thigh as she slowly collapsed to the floor.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">B. leapt to her feet growling low in her throat. Quickly I grabbed her talking softly, "No, hold on. Not now." Motioning with their guns they waved us out the door and into the back of a van. Soon we were seated and chained to the wall. The doors slammed shut and the truck headed off into the night.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Once we stopped the back door opened wide enough to admit Quentin Travers. He stood nervously near the door while B. screamed, "Bastard. I'll kill you for this. Never let me go cause you're a dead man."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Slowly he edged closer to me. "I have to talk to you."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Don't trust him. He’s a lying sack of shit. Travers you are so dead."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"B., what can it hurt? He’s got us." She glared at me. "B., do you trust me?" She continued to glare but eventually nodded slowly. "Then let him speak."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Thank you," he replied. I just looked him up and down coldly. "Yes, well... I find myself in a bad place actually." he reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys. "I'm going to get you out of here..."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The door slammed open. "Well Quentin, just as I thought." The leader from the house assault stepped up to the truck flanked by four men carrying weapons. "I knew you'd lost the stomach for it. Come now old man, you know we have to have a slayer we can control. These two abominations cannot be allowed to continue." He motioned to one of the others. "Get those keys and chain him with them. Make sure he's close to the blonde one, maybe she'll kill him for us. It'll make our job easier. Now, I bet you wonder what happens next. I don't want to ruin any surprises. Let’s just say you will be taking a trip and leave it at that shall we?" He motioned again and the doors swung shut once more.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Snarling B. leapt at Travers. "B.! Remember the last one. Do you want another ghost?" She screamed again and brought her head to her manacled hands. "It’s getting too strong. I can't hold it anymore. Travers, why?" She howled in rage and pulled back shaking. "Look at me! Look what you've done!" She slid down the wall as far as she could sobbing. 'Faith, help," it came out in a whimper. I slid over as far as I could and touched her foot with mine. It was as close as we could get.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">The truck started moving again as I looked over at Travers. "Guess you better tell us what's happening."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Not much more to tell now. The council decided both of you should die so a new slayer could be called. I don't like either of you. You're dangerous, undisciplined, and uncontrollable but you are the best we've had in decades. I was going to free you against my better judgment. The original plan was to take you back to London and kill you there. Now I don't know what they'll do."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Pretty speech Travers, especially after you tried to chip me." B. snarled at him.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yes, about that, I still wish we could control you. You spit in the face of everything we stand for and I don't like it. I did not want you dead though. You are too good a slayer to waste that way."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I could feel the First One stalking around in my mind now. B.'s rage was fueling her, bringing her closer. It wouldn't be long until I joined B. in out of control land. Gritting my teeth I forced myself to stay calm. "If we get out of this can you do anything to stop them?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know. The council is split over this and several other issues. There was a time when I could have but the last events of George and his plans have left everything very unsettled."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Look, we're in serious shit here."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"I know it!" he shouted. "We may have to kill them rather than let them go back," he continued in a quieter voice.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I slid down to the floor as Allan flashed across my mind again. "No, not again. Too many, too many already."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"So, rogue slayer, great time to develop a conscience." Travers sneered.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Same could be said tweed-guy," I shot back. "And I have a name you wanker."</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Touché. Faith." we sat silently for a few minutes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Ok," I said heavily. "I'll do it. We just have to get loose. Do you have anything small in your pockets? Ballpoint pen spring? Paper clip? Anything?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No Faith, I'll do it. I'm behind you anyway." B. said slowly, fear staring out through her eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"It’s ok B. they can keep the other ghosts company." I tried to keep my voice light but she could see the agony in my eyes.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">Travers was fumbling at his pockets with the distance the chains would allow him. Just as he pulled a pen from his pocket a dull whump sounded and the truck flipped onto its side. We fell heavily against the side of the truck as it screeched along the road on its side. We could hear short bursts of weapons fire from outside as the truck ground to a halt.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">After long moments of silence there was another dull whump from the back of the truck and the bottom door fell open. A muzzle poked in through the hole followed by Xander. He stared at me for several beats and finally moved to unlock us. Once we were loose he looked at Travers and said shortly, "Want him?" I nodded quickly and Xander looked at B. When she nodded as well he unlocked Travers and helped him up.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">We started toward the back of the truck when Spike said, "One of them's missing. Better get gone soon." Xander motioned us out and then pointed toward Spike's car. He scanned the area with his gun just like a war movie. It might have been funny if there weren't four bodies lying on the grass. In the car Tara was huddled in the back seat. Spike leapt in and we roared off.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">I looked at Tara and asked quietly, "You found us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">She nodded shyly. "Wicked cool, thanks." She gave me a hesitant smile in return.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">By the time we got back to B.'s Xander was looking green. Without a word he ran for the bathroom, emerging a long time later looking pale. "Sucks don't it?" I asked him quietly while B. was talking to Red.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"Yeah, but at least I'm alive to feel like shit about it." We moved into the living room and he approached Travers. "Do you think they'll try and use our rescue as a way to get us?"</p>

<p class="regtxt5">"No. They'll try another covert way. The council doesn't like to come out of the shadows. This would make it too high a profile and probably prevent them from getting the slayers out of the country." Travers answered. "They'll only use it if they need to get the rest of you out of the way for a while, although they won't want to have to produce the bodies."</p>
</br>
<p class="regtxt5">/* possible ending - downer style */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* use if it turns out they can't be together */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I don't know B. I think the psyches are wrong. Some of us are too damaged to heal the way they say." I looked at her sadly. "You take care of your dead guy. He’s quite a catch. I'll miss ya B... quite a ride."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"I love you Faith," the tears on her face were the last things I saw as I fell back into the darkness.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* original quote: "Should have been there, B...quite a ride." */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on love */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Faith - The first time here I was obsessed with you. You had it all and I was the second best, the runner up slayer. It flipped me out to tell the truth. This time, well I had to learn to face some shit when I was in the joint. I want to say I love you but I don't really know as I know what love is. It feels good to be with you. I feel stronger, more complete and happiest when I'm near you. I want to keep you safe, help you, and care for you. If that's love then I've got it bad.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on survival */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Buffy - How did you survive it all? I had friends, my mom, Giles and I barely made it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Faith - I wouldn't let them win. When it got hardest I told myself if I cracked or died, then they won and I couldn't let that happen.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* on people */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Faith - i struggle with it some days. the desire to call down death on large parts of humanity for the stupid, naroow mindedness of them. i'm really glad i can't. i understand Red more now though. i think she feels it as well</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* attitude redux */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">faith - i didn't have time B. i was in my first knife fight when i was twelve cuz i wouldn't put out for a boy. i won, but that was only the start. you could either be tough or put out for someone who was. quite a few of the girls my age already had steady boys just cuz it was the only way to stay kinda safe.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">faith - i tried it for a while when i was fifteen, just before my watcher found me. it worked, but it was worse than fighting. you had to be there whenever they wanted some and then know when to get gone so they didn't look whipped. it sucked.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* afterlife ver. 1 */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">faith - a friend of mine always believed you got to choose. what did you find B.? when you died?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">buffy - how do you mean?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">faith - he said with all the other worlds out there you got to choose where your soul went. he had his new world all picked out and everything. i always wonder what he found. his father beat him to death one night when he didn't make footbal try-outs.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">buffy - oh god...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">faith - welcome to my childhood - but you saw that, didn't you?</p>
<p class="regtxt5">buffy - gods faith, i saw so much, too much...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">buffy - after long pause - i don't remember. i know i was where my mom was...i don't remember being asked but i always assumed it was either heaven or hell and that was it.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* life */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">faith - ya know - it's a sad commentary when you're alive not so much cuz you want to be as you're too stuborn to die...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">buffy - or because your friends won't let you stay dead</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* buffy - faith dreamtime */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">faith will be reluctant to trust buffy right away. she still loves her but is no longer obsessed with her. also she will no longer automatically seek buffy out or seek her approval. she has been burned and learned in prison not to let people influence her core as much as she let buffy the first time around.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">faith - i want to trust you, but i can't, not this time. i'll come back with you for the ritual, cuz you need me for it. i won't stay though, i can't. i'm not sure i can trust myself if i stay. i'm not obsessed like i was, but it will still hurt too much.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* love, trust, obsession */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">faith - you know it's not just our fault - something in the signals you send out make us think you care more than you actually do. i wanted to trust you that time. i wanted it so bad and you encouraged it for just long enough. but i wasn't quite fast enough for you. just when i started to trust you had backed away. i won't do it this time. i can't afford to.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">buffy - i'm not the same as i was then. it'll be different this time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">faith - i'm sure you aren't, hell i'm not either, but i'm not strong enough to take that risk again. i'll help with the ritual and the council, but then i need to get gone.</p>
