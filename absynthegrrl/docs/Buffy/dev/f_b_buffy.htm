<p class="pagecaption">Faith-Buffy - Buffy Perspective</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* during the dreamings */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* First dreaming */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* Buffy/Spike */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Hey pet," Spike called as Buffy walked in after work. "Mail’s by the stairs, dinner in a few." She glanced at the stack of mail, separating the bills from the rest until she reached the bottom of the stack. There was an official looking envelope from the California Prison System addressed to Ms. Buffy Summers. She stared at it for long moments until Spike came up behind her, pulled her to him, and kissed her hello. "See you found the letter."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Faith," she whispered as she stared at it. After long moments she set it back down and moved away. She spent the rest of the evening in their usual way. Dinner and television with Dawn, then cuddling with Spike and finally sleep. Faith wouldn’t leave her mind though. Every time a lull in conversation or the programs would happen she found her thoughts drawn back to Faith.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Sleep came more slowly as she tossed and turned. Finally Spike rolled up on his side and began gently massaging her back and neck. Only after long minutes did she finally slide down into sleep. Her eyes opened onto shadows, fire, and the open desert. Wind whipped sparks from the fire, sending them spiraling up to the heavens. Buffy looked around, scanning for the First One only to see a dark shadow moving on the far side of the fire. As the shadow moved closer Buffy noticed a weight in her hand. There, clutched tightly, was the bloody blade she had stabbed into Faith years ago. As she glanced back up the figure stepped into the light. "Hey B., see you still got my knife."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Faith, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Don’t know B, thought you called the party."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Buffy’s eyes flew open to find Spike curled up beside her. Carefully she snuggled in closer, drawing comfort from him. Slowly sleep came again.</p>

<p class="regtxt5">/* after the second dreaming and into the third */</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Buffy shot up from her dream, disturbing Spike. "What was it pet?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Nothing, just a weird dream. I’m ok." Spike looked at her for moments longer before lying back down. Buffy’s hand unconsciously rubbed at the cramp in her side where the blood had come from before snuggling down in Spike’s arms. Softly she kissed him as dreamless sleep claimed her this time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The next day passed in a blur as she did a few things around the house, took Dawn to school, and went patrolling in the evening. Late that night sleep claimed her again. Within moments her eyes opened onto shadows, fire, and the open desert again. Wind whipped sparks from the fire, sending them spiraling up to the heavens. Buffy looked around, scanning for the First One only to see a dark shadow moving on the far side of the fire. As the shadow moved closer Buffy noticed a weight in her hand. There, clutched tightly, was the bloody blade she had stabbed into Faith years ago. As she glanced back up the figure stepped into the light. "Hey B., see you still got my knife."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Faith, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p class="regtxt5">"Don’t know B, thought you called the party." Faith stares at Buffy for long moments before motioning to the knife. "You would succeed this time. I won’t fight it."</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Buffy stares at the knife as it morphs into a scroll. Slowly she unrolls it and begins to read. Words in a language dead before the Egyptians roll from her mouth in a somber stream. Slowly a trick of blood leaks from the wound on Faith’s stomach. Buffy looks down startled as a similar stream of blood flows from an identical wound on her. Her voice falters and the words trail off into the distance.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Silently the First One stalks to where the fire was. Her hands shoot out to touch both of their foreheads. Instantly they go rigid as images crash through them. Screaming she shoots up in bed. "NO!" Buffy shrieked as images from Faith’s past crashed over her. "Oh gods, Faith, I’m so sorry. I didn’t know, I didn’t know."</p>
