<p class="regtxt5">/* letter to Joyce */</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Mrs. S.,
I don’t really know how to start this, so please try and stay with me. I’ve been working with the shrinks here at the prison and they say I need to write to you to start my healing. I don’t know what to say to you. After holding a knife to you and threatening to kill you I really don’t think sorry is quite enough. But I am, I really am. You could have been the mother I wanted. You were as a matter of fact, but things got so weird between B...Buffy and I that I guess it just couldn’t be.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I don’t expect anything from you and I want you to know I am fully aware you will probably not be able to forgive me for what I have done. I just needed to say it to you.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I hurt so bad inside that it was just so much easier to lash out at my surroundings rather than try and face it. I still hurt. I know I told Buffy I didn’t care, but I guess I do. I see Allan and my watcher every night. Watch them die over and over again and still I can’t change it. I hope Buffy is well and I hope she has been able to forgive herself for what she thinks she did. Did Buffy ever tell you she stabbed me for Angel? If it will help her, please let her know that I had hoped she would succeed that night. I wanted her to. I don’t blame her and I forgave her a long time ago.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Faith</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* letter to Buffy  - written shortly after the attempted sacrifice */</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Hey B,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I don’t know what just happened to you, but I hope you’re ok. It hurt almost as bad as when you died. Angel told me about it, but I felt you leaving when it happened. I really want you to be alright.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I know you said you would beat me to death if I ever tried to apologize. Well, unless you sneak in here, I guess I’m safe. I am apologizing. I’m not asking for your understanding or forgiveness. I want you to know I wanted you to succeed at the apartment. Not for soul boy, but to end the pain. I tried to let go after I fell, but it didn’t work. The slayer part of me wouldn’t let me. I forgave you long ago if you care. I’m sorry I woke up pissed off. I wanted an ending and it didn’t happen. Not your fault even if I did take it out on you.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Given the latest, at least from what soul boy has told me, I guess it was a good thing I didn’t die though. At least the council didn’t get another puppet slayer to control. Maybe a small amount of good came from all this. I have to tell you that they’ve tried to kill me once already. I spent some time in solitary for it. I don’t plan to let them succeed now though. The shrinks here have helped some.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">That and the emails to your mom. I bet she didn’t tell you. Do you know what she said to you about me when I was you? She wondered what drove me to be bad. After I held a knife to her, threatened her, she still thought there was something in me worth saving. Gods I wish she was still here. Her emails are one of the few things that held me together. I, well, I guess you should know, now that she’s gone. Gods B, I’m so sorry. All my life I wished for a mom like yours, and I still had to go and screw it up.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Anyway, I’ll back you any way I can against the council. Just let me know what you need and I’ll do what I can.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">Congrats, I guess, on William. He’s hot for a dead guy. Hell, he’s just plain hot! If you can forgive him, maybe there’s a chance for me somewhere in the distant future. Is he ok? I got this really weird tangle of visions last night. It looked like he was hurt as well as you.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I don’t know what’s gonna happen here. The mayor got rid of all the murder stuff so I can’t even pay for what I’ve done. You were right. I wish I could have let you know. I do care. I see them every night and nothing changes. The stake goes down, Allan dies, and nothing I can do stops it.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">They’re turning me loose soon. Don’t worry, I won’t come back. I’ve arranged with soul boy to go into hiding here, maybe do a little on the side for him to survive with. He’ll know how to find me in case you need to warn me about the council or anything.</p>

<p class="regtxt9">I’m sorry for everything and I wish I could go back and try again. There’s so much more I want to say, but this is probably more than enough already. I have never hated you. Envied you, feared you, loved you, been jealous as hell of you, but never hated you.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Faith</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* letter from Buffy after she reads the letter above and after the 3 night dream */</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Faith,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I got your letter the other day. I saw the emails between you and my mom. I don’t know how I feel about any of this just yet, but I want you to know there are a few things I understand a little better now.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">I don’t know what Angel has told you about the last year. Did he tell you where I was? After I died? I was in heaven. I was with my mom and I was happy and I was able to stop feeling all the confusion and pain of being the slayer. Until my friends hauled me back. They didn’t even try to find out where I was, they just cast the spell and bang, here I was. But you know what the real kick was? The real punch to the gut? They didn’t even know they succeeded. A group of demons interrupted them so no one was there to dig me out of my coffin. Gave me a new perspective on our job I gotta say when I had to claw my own way out. They didn’t tell Spike or Dawn, guess they knew those two would tell them not to. Spike understood, I guess you might too.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">We thought we had it all figured you know. What and who you were. We didn’t even try to find out if we were right, we just went ahead and did our thing. I want to apologize too. I’m sorry for abandoning you, for pushing you away, and most of all for not trying harder to be there when we killed Allan Finch. When WE killed him. I know you said you forgave me for the knife, I just wish I could forgive myself. I see it every night as well. I’m sorry Faith. All I ever wanted was to be your friend but I was too scared.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Buffy</p>
<p class="regtxt5">/* back to Buffy */</p>
<p class="regtxt9">B,</p>
<p class="regtxt9">We’re five by five on the killing thing. I’m glad you didn’t now, but at the time..well, anyway, I was pissed it didn’t happen.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Hey, don’t beat yourself up too much. I coulda said something too. I never was very good at the whole communication thing. Leftovers from my family where don’t ask, don’t tell was the only way to avoid beatings and isolation. I wish I coulda opened up like this before things went to shit instead of after. It woulda been wicked cool to be a part of the scoobs, even if I couldn’t admit it then.</p>
