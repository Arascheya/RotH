<p class="regtxt5">Surrounding the Hut in a 45' wide circle is a "picket fence" of twenty-four sharp stakes, each about 5' tall, with a human, humanoid, or demihuman skull resting on the spike. Between each stake is a lattice work of various bones forming a low fence. Inside the fence is a grassy lawn. Around the Hut itself is a flowerbed filled with poppies, nightshade, huge venus fly trap looking plants, calla lilies, and other beautiful but more sinister and "gothic" style flowers.</p>

<p class="sectioncaption">Hut Basics</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Hut is a magical and technological based construct. The main section occupies a stabilized pocket dimension outside the time stream of Real-Space. This pocket dimension is only accessible through the Interface. The Interface is a portal that is temporarily constructed between the Hut and Real-Space locations. The Hut itself doesn't actually move. The time delay when changing locations is often the search for the target location in its Real-Space time and location. Because the Hut is a construct it is extremely easy to re-configure based on the desires of the occupants. In default conditions only the Controller may set configurations. The Controller can assign elevated permissions to other Hut occupants if desired.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Because the Hut Interface is a linking between two Realms, it is impervious to most forms of attack. An incredibly powerful dispel magic spell could deconstruct it in the Realm  in which it was hit. Anyone in the Hut could re-establish the Interface link at will, however this restructuring is hard on the Hut energy systems. If the Controller were on location in Real-Space she could also call for a restructuring of the Interface once the danger was neutralized.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Stabilization is maintained through a computational device powered by both magical and technological sources. A complex structure of spells, programs, and power conditioners maintain the pocket dimension in a stable state. Power system failure will first effect the ability to form the Interface, after that, Hut configuration and environmental stability, followed by the collapse of the pocket dimension. If power failure becomes severe enough the Hut will begin to siphon energy from those linked to it. As the Hut dies, so do the linked entities. The last two systems to go off-line are the Interface and the engineering core.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Interface will fail in two main ways. The first is a benign error, "Interface Connect Failed: Unable to resolve target location". This means the Controller didn't have a clear enough visualization of the desired target for the nav system to find it. The second failure is more severe and results from systems failures within the Hut. The message is "Interface Fault: System Malfunction. Interface Locked to Nearest Target".  If the Interface was attempting to connect with Real-Space it will connect to the nearest Real-Space target available and lock itself there. The Interface remains locked to the target location until the fault is fixed and the control systems reset. If the Interface was not attempting to connect when the error occurred it will attempt to lock to the nav-sys location "Home 0" in an attempt to not trap the Hut occupants.</p>
