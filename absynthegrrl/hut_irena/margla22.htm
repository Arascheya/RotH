<p class="sectioncaption">22 - Garden Maze</p>
<p class="regtxt5">10' flat overall: IL, ceiling illuminates room (see below; ND).</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="mHutRmDetails.htm">Hut Room Details</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">This unusual area appears to be an outdoor hedge maze; a false "sun" appears to shine overhead, though it is only an illusion and the ceiling is as high as the hedge-tops. One foot of earth covers the floor, but it cannot be affected by spells or dug completely away.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The hedges appear to be a strange combination of thornbushes and fruit-bearing plants; large red berries the size of apples grow upon it in a few places. Each character has a 10% chance per one round's worth of normal movement (see below) through the maze to see 1-2 of the berries. The berries can be taken from their branches, but will lose their special properties within one day after they are removed from the area of the maze. If a berry is eaten, there is a 90% chance that it will act to dispel exhaustion (at the 6th level of power) on the consumer; the other 10% of the time, the eater will be deluded (as per a potion of delusion) into thinking that his wounds are cured when they haven't been.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">If anyone moves through the maze who is not a regular inhabitant of the Hut, the maze will come to life and attempt to slow the intruders by entangling them. The thorns on the bushes will do damage equal to a character's armor class in each round the character is held or slowed (characters with AC 0 or better take no damage). Normal movement through this area is at underground scale; that is, 10' per 1" movement rate per round, so a character moving at 6" should go 60' per minute. Slowed characters move at half the normal rate (and have half the normal chance to find berries).</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The plants in this room are not affected by fire, cold, lightning, or poison gas. Entangle, locate plants, warp wood, and turn wood spells have no effect on the vegetation. If someone changes into a plant, using polymorph self polymorph other, tree, or the like, the plants will cease to attack. Plant growth and wall of thorns will cause the hedges to do double damage to victims, and will slow movement to one-quarter normal through the pathways. Charm plants, hold plant, speak with plants, and anti-plant shell will all cause the hedges to cease bothering beings within the area of effect. Plant door, pass plant, and transport via plants all function normally.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Any attempt to chop at the plants will be frustrated, since they repair damage to themselves within seconds. Attempting to push through a hedge wall, even with giant strength, will cause the character to suffer damage as if trying to push through a wall of thorns, and the attempt will not succeed.</p>
