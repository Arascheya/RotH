<p class="regtxt5">CH, 20' flat overall; IL, see below.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="HutRmDetails.htm">Hut Room Details</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Each alcove ends in an ornate carved stone doorway. There is no passage throught. Instead each doorway can function as a gate to other realms. Under the control of the Hut Controller the one near B and E will open into Centrys on a side street in the Lady's Ward. The other one contains two worn sandstone sphinxes facing each other. On the chest of the one to the left is the data entry panel for the sphynx web controller. This portal will access all destinations based on correct programming.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">During Margla's residency the Sphynx Web wall has a portal to the DemonWeb instead of the Sphynx Web controller.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Both Gate areas are protected by heavy defensive systems. The green line is a 6th Order Screen. The yellow line indicates a row of skull symbols marking a Mind Wipe Prismatic Wall. The red area can be bombarded with Lightning bolts, Fireballs, Cones of Cold, and heavy ship blasters. These defenses can only be deactivated by the Hut Controller.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Both Gates can be auto-configured by the NavSys when the Hut jumps to a particular location. For example: when the Hut jumps to Home0, the Outlands near Centrys, the <a href="../gm_resources/info/gateinfo.htm">World Gate</a> is configured to link into a meeting room in the 12 Factols, She...'s Quarter, Centrys. These locations are given in the <a href="navsys.htm">NavSys database</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">This entire room is constructed of Adamantite.</p>
