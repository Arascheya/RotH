<p class="regtxt5">CH, 7' flat; IL, oil lantern on table.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../HutRmDetails.htm">Hut Room Details</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">The default appearance is of an old peasant woman's hut. The floor is packed dirt with wooden walls and ceiling rafters. A small wooden table with one chair sits in one corner of the room. Beneath the table is a small wash basin. There is a wood burning stove in another corner with its chimney rising to the ceiling. Near the stove is a small straw filled mattress with a worn quilt over it. Clothes pegs, shelves, eating utensils, and sewing supplies complete the room's contents.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">A secret door on the floor is covered by the washbasin under the table; wooden stairs lead down. A wooden ladder (B) is fixed against the wall next to the table, apparently leading up to an attic. On the wall of the Hut opposite the front door is another door made of old wood.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Several peculiar things will be noticed if characters take the time to explore this area. The stove automatically reduces all nonliving materials placed inside it to one-fourth normal size, until the material is removed. A basket next to the stove contains charred goblin, elf, and human bones jumbled together; all have marks on them as if a creature with sharp teeth gnawed away what meat they had.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">On a dusty shelf behind the stove is a small intricately cast iron brazier. This is the <a href="../../gm_resources/items/HutCauldron.htm">Hut Cauldron</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The only live encounter here is with Baba Yaga's cat, a large gray tabby named Vladimir (treat as an 18 HP giant lynx, neutral alignment). Vlad uses limited telepathy to communicate with intelligent beings within 10' of him, and can detect lie with 99% accuracy. He can hide in shadows and move silently with 99% success, and can surprise opponents on a roll of 1-5 on d6. Vladimir will speak only to those who treat him well, and will ignore all others. He can offer limited advice to the PCs (as much as the referee wants to impart).</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Interface can be configured, on the fly, to look any way desired by the Controller at the time of instantiation.</p>
