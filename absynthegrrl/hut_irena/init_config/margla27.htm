<p class="pagecaption">Grand Library - CH, 15' flat in each room; IL, each room has 5 CL's, one in center and one in each corner.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../HutRmDetails.htm">Hut Room Details</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">The library resembles the layout used in Name of the Rose. Each book chamber is 10x10 with four ways out. Otherwise there are stairways linking to platforms around the chambers and to other chambers. There are over one hundred small book chambers linked together in this maze of stairways and rooms. If additional books are added to the library new rooms may be added to contain them. The Librarian controls the linking of the rooms, the ordering of the books, and the creation of new book chambers. The spell books of ancient mages lie here beside texts discussing the nature of magic and the universe, and volumes covering hundreds of other topics. Books are distributed in what looks like random order. In fact the order makes perfect sense to the Librarian.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">After the assimilation of Tyana into the Hut systems the library will expand to include the collections from the master library of level seven of the labyrinth. This expands the number of linked chambers to over 200 and the number of connections to the library complex is expanded to 7, each linking from one of the 7 points of the central courtyard, also copied from the level seven complex. The central courtyard now connects to 7 atrium/cloister-like corridors that open onto the formal gardens. The brainscan unit has been moved here as well in a coup by Kayara and Sharyl.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The is an open <a href="../hutbook.htm">journal</a> on the table in room A. Also on the table are five closed books: <a href="../magic_theory.htm">Magic Theory</a>, <a href="../gate_theory.htm">Gate Theory</a>, <a href="../hut_notes.htm">Hut Tesch Doc</a>, <a href="../akhalt.htm">Akhalt</a>, and <a href="../starstones.htm">Star Stones</a>.</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../../gm_resources/npcs/klktzash.htm">Klktzash</a> serves as librarian here. Margla attempted to free her from her contract before the final jump but she refused to leave. She is devoted to the library and the books. She will respect and assist any who show the same concern and respect for the library as she does.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Near each door is a magical niche where books may be placed. Any book placed within is automatically re-shelved.</p>
