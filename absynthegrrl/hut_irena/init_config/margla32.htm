<p class="regtxt5">CH, 10' flat; IL, ceiling gives off soft light (as light spell) over area for 12 hours/day, then drops to almost total darkness for 12 hours (ND).</p>
<p class="regtxt5"><a href="../mHutRmDetails.htm">Hut Room Details</a></p>
<p class="regtxt5">Eight octagonal cages are in this room, each separated from the other and from onlookers by walls of force that complete their octagonal shapes. The walls of force may be removed or raised with a brief command phrase, which names the creature to be captured or freed; however, only magic-users of 12th level or higher will be able to use such commands successfully.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Each cage will magically create food and drink for its inhabitants, freshen their air, and otherwise keep the creatures alive. These cages may be used as prison cells, of course, whenever necessary. Most creatures are gotten in and out of this room by reduce spells or other magical means.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Cage C contains the Thing currently in the form of a large wolf. Cage H contains a Rancor. The other cages are currently empty.</p>
