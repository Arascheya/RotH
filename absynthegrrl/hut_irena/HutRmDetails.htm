<p class="sectioncaption">Room Details</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The following abbreviations are used in the room descriptions:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">CH = ceiling height</p>
<p class="regtxt5">IL = illumination</p>
<p class="regtxt5">CL = continual light (magic-user spell, 25th level)</p>
<p class="regtxt5">ND = effect cannot be dispelled</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Additional Notes:</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Each area is connected to other areas by special trans-dim gates. Most of these gates look like normal doorways, though some are built into staircases going up and down between areas. Unless certain spell effects tell them otherwise, characters will probably not know when they are crossing from one area to the next. If the Hut Controller or any other being linked to the Hut Matrix approach any doorway in the Hut, the door will automatically open for them and close one segment after they pass. All other beings (including characters) must force the doors open using normal strength rolls.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Hut is a trans-dimensional construct. It is defined by the MCP running in the core computer equipment and powered by the matter-antimatter reaction system in room 01. Each room derives from a "Zero Room" which is the base class for all Hut rooms. The Hut is configured by the Hut Controller and may be dynamically restructured at any time.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">In certain areas, secret doors have been built into the floors and ceilings. Many of these open directly into other areas, though no ladders or stairways are around. These portals are enchanted so that if any being bound to the Hut calls out a command word ("Up!" or "Down!") when standing next to the portals, they will receive a levitate spell for 1 round that automatically takes them up or down safely to the next floor. However, this will not work for any other characters.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Regardless of the weather conditions outside, the interior of the Hut (in all areas, unless otherwise stated) is pleasantly warm and dry. Unless stated otherwise, most rooms in the Hut appear to have walls made of dark, stony material. The DM may add extra details as desired.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The Hut is bound automatically to the three beings forming the Hut Triad. The Hut Controller may integrate other beings into the hut on an as-desired basis. Once this is accomplished the added being is considered a member of the Hut Matrix and thus able to use all permissions assigned by the Hut Controller. Permissions may be set differently for each being bound to the Hut.</p>
