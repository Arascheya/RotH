<p class="regtxt5">Devil cursed and demon haunted Akhalt, center of the Galhai Wastes, where power mad sorcerers of yore called down to this earthly sphere a demon from beyond, to their unending sorrow... Akhalt, where the Undying One rules from the Glowing Throne to this very day... doomed, cursed Akhalt, which the very gods spurned, transforming all the realm around it into a burning waste...</p>
<p class="regtxt5">Akhalt, where Tesch Mar and Nyigroth battled for the Star Stones, greatest of the Ancient Magics. Desolation is all that remains and the Star Stones are scattered to the winds.</p>
