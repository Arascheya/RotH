<p class="regtxt5">It works, I have combined a techno device and a majik spell! So far it is crude but it will work. The hardest part was creating an operating system hook in the small computer of the techno device that could read and interpret the majik energies linked to the thought crystal interface. I wish Kayara was still around, she was an absolute genius with software, particularly operating systems, and could have written a new system to handle all of this. I must acquire more computer equipment, maybe a larger system will work better.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">The device I have created is a magical and technological based construct. The main section occupies a stabilized pocket dimension outside the time stream of Real-Space. This pocket dimension is only accessible through the Interface. The Interface is a portal that is temporarily constructed between the device and Real-Space locations. The device itself doesn't actually move. The time delay when changing locations is often the search for the target location in its Real-Space time and location. Because the device is a construct it is extremely easy to re-configure based on the desires of the occupants. In default conditions only the Controller may set configurations. The Controller can assign elevated permissions to other Hut occupants if desired.</p>
<p class="regtxt5">There are several main class types in this construct - one is based on the fundamentals of ‘real space’ matter, this is the absolute base class, ZeroRM, and provides the inheritance for all other classes. Derived from it are StaticRM and TransRM. StaticRM will be alterable by me and only me, TransRM will be modifiable by anyone who shares this place with me. Further derivation yields StaticObj and TransObj. StaticObj is to objects as StaticRM but for objects and items that I might wish to have around me. TransObj provides the same function as TransRM. AttachObj, LinkEntity, and AttachEntity allow ‘real space’ objects and beings to be linked into the construct so they can be moved with it. All of this is done in majik and tech, kind of a true ‘multi-platform’ approach.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">Room objects may contain several room objects allowing a suite of rooms to be considered a single instance object in the device operating environment. A classic example is the library StaticRM object which is composed of several StaticRM objects.</p>
<p class="regtxt9">LinkEntity - 1 Instance - me</p>
<p class="regtxt9">AttachEntity - Instances vary with number of guests</p>
<p class="regtxt5">It works. I just don’t think I’ll ever try to relink anything at the ZeroRM level - the first, and only, time I tried it, it hurt so much I wasn’t sure I could even get through the start-up procedures. So far I have been able to visit anywhere and not have troubles. The construct is powered by both majik and techno and seems able to function in areas where one or both types of energy exist.</p>
