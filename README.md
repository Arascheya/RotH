#### Disclaimer:

Any copyrighted material included in the backgrounders is for idea springboarding, not for straight up inclusion. The same applies to found artwork for place, character, or detail examples.

Accessing this data is considered to be an acceptance of the standard NDA - basically, don't share it so widely that it wouldn't be publishable if I ever get my act together.

Questions, comments, etc. are always welcome!
